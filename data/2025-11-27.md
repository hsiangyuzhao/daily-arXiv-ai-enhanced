*David Amebley,Sayanton Dibbo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了多模态视觉语言模型（VLMs）在黑盒隐私攻击下的脆弱性，提出一种受神经科学启发的拓扑正则化框架（tau），以增强模型对图像-文本联合推理隐私攻击的抵抗力。实验在BLIP、PaliGemma 2和ViT-GPT2模型上进行，使用COCO、CC3M和NoCaps数据集，结果表明引入tau正则化的神经型VLM（NEURO VLM）在保持模型性能的同时，使成员推断攻击（MIA）的成功率平均下降24%的ROC-AUC，验证了其在隐私保护方面的有效性与一致性。

Motivation: 随着多模态模型在智能系统中的广泛应用，其训练数据可能面临隐私泄露风险，尤其是成员推断攻击。尽管已有研究探讨单模态模型的隐私防护，但多模态模型特别是基于神经科学启发的模型在隐私攻击下的鲁棒性尚不明确，亟需系统评估与改进方法。

Method: 提出一种受神经系统拓扑结构启发的拓扑正则化框架（tau），应用于三种主流视觉语言模型（BLIP、PaliGemma 2、ViT-GPT2），通过调节tau参数构建神经型VLM（NEURO VLM），并在此基础上开展黑盒成员推断攻击实验，评估其在不同数据集上的隐私防御能力。

Result: 在COCO、CC3M和NoCaps数据集上，采用tau > 0的NEURO VLM相比基线模型，在成员推断攻击中平均降低24%的ROC-AUC，同时在MPNet和ROUGE-2等指标上保持相近的生成质量，说明该方法有效提升了隐私安全性而不显著牺牲模型性能。

Conclusion: 受神经科学启发的拓扑正则化框架能显著提升多模态视觉语言模型对隐私攻击的抵抗能力，为多模态模型的安全部署提供了新的技术路径，有助于缓解敏感数据泄露风险。

Abstract: In the age of agentic AI, the growing deployment of multi-modal models (MMs) has introduced new attack vectors that can leak sensitive training data in MMs, causing privacy leakage. This paper investigates a black-box privacy attack, i.e., membership inference attack (MIA) on multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs). State-of-the-art research analyzes privacy attacks primarily to unimodal AI-ML systems, while recent studies indicate MMs can also be vulnerable to privacy attacks. While researchers have demonstrated that biologically inspired neural network representations can improve unimodal model resilience against adversarial attacks, it remains unexplored whether neuro-inspired MMs are resilient against privacy attacks. In this work, we introduce a systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework to analyze MM VLMs resilience against image-text-based inference privacy attacks. We examine this phenomenon using three VLMs: BLIP, PaliGemma 2, and ViT-GPT2, across three benchmark datasets: COCO, CC3M, and NoCaps. Our experiments compare the resilience of baseline and neuro VLMs (with topological regularization), where the tau > 0 configuration defines the NEURO variant of VLM. Our results on the BLIP model using the COCO dataset illustrate that MIA attack success in NEURO VLMs drops by 24% mean ROC-AUC, while achieving similar model utility (similarities between generated and reference captions) in terms of MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics. This shows neuro VLMs are comparatively more resilient against privacy attacks, while not significantly compromising model utility. Our extensive evaluation with PaliGemma 2 and ViT-GPT2 models, on two additional datasets: CC3M and NoCaps, further validates the consistency of the findings. This work contributes to the growing understanding of privacy risks in MMs and provides evidence on neuro VLMs privacy threat resilience.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inferix is a next-generation inference engine designed for immersive world synthesis using semi-autoregressive decoding, enabling efficient, high-quality, and interactive video generation with real-time streaming, profiling, and benchmarking via LV-Bench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance world models by overcoming limitations of current video diffusion and LLM-centric vision models, enabling more coherent, stable, and interactive long-form video generation for agentic AI, embodied AI, and gaming.

Method: Utilizes a semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm that combines diffusion and autoregressive methods, incorporating LLM-style KV Cache management for efficient variable-length generation, alongside interactive streaming and fine-grained evaluation through LV-Bench.

Result: Achieves high-quality, physically realistic, and interactive video generation with improved coherence and efficiency, supporting real-time interaction and accurate simulation of world dynamics, while enabling precise benchmarking for minute-long video scenarios.

Conclusion: Inferix represents a significant step forward in world model inference, offering a specialized platform for immersive world synthesis and paving the way for future advancements in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning beyond current LLM-based models.

Abstract: World models serve as core simulators for fields such as agentic AI, embodied AI, and gaming, capable of generating long, physically realistic, and interactive high-quality videos. Moreover, scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, paving the way for a new paradigm that moves beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models. A key breakthrough empowering them is the semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, which merges the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones, resulting in more coherent and stable video sequences. Crucially, it overcomes limitations of standard video diffusion by reintroducing LLM-style KV Cache management, enabling efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation.
  Therefore, Inferix is specifically designed as a next-generation inference engine to enable immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding processes. This dedicated focus on world simulation distinctly sets it apart from systems engineered for high-concurrency scenarios (like vLLM or SGLang) and from classic video diffusion models (such as xDiTs). Inferix further enhances its offering with interactive video streaming and profiling, enabling real-time interaction and realistic simulation to accurately model world dynamics. Additionally, it supports efficient benchmarking through seamless integration of LV-Bench, a new fine-grained evaluation benchmark tailored for minute-long video generation scenarios. We hope the community will work together to advance Inferix and foster world model exploration.

### [3] [DeeAD: Dynamic Early Exit of Vision-Language Action for Efficient Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20720)
*Haibo HU,Lianming Huang,Nan Guan,Chun Jason Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeeAD is a training-free, action-guided early-exit framework for Vision-Language Action (VLA) models in autonomous driving, reducing inference latency by terminating inference when predicted trajectories align with lightweight planning priors within a 2m tolerance. It uses a multi-hop controller to skip redundant layers based on score change rates. Integrated into existing models like ORION without retraining, it achieves up to 28% transformer-layer sparsity and 29% latency reduction on Bench2Drive while maintaining planning quality and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models for autonomous driving suffer from high inference latency due to deep transformer architectures. Reducing latency without compromising planning quality or safety is critical for real-time deployment.

Method: DeeAD introduces an early-exit mechanism based on physical feasibility of intermediate trajectories using lightweight planning priors (e.g., Navigation or Low-precision Planning). It employs a multi-hop controller that adaptively skips unnecessary transformer layers by monitoring the rate of change in prediction scores, enabling efficient inference without retraining.

Result: On the Bench2Drive benchmark, DeeAD achieves up to 28% sparsity in transformer layers and 29% reduction in inference latency, while preserving planning accuracy and safety performance.

Conclusion: DeeAD effectively accelerates VLA-based planning in autonomous driving through a training-free, action-guided early-exit strategy, offering significant efficiency gains without sacrificing model reliability or safety.

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models unify perception, reasoning, and trajectory generation for autonomous driving, but suffer from significant inference latency due to deep transformer stacks. We present DeeAD, a training-free, action-guided early-exit framework that accelerates VLA planning by evaluating the physical feasibility of intermediate trajectories. Instead of relying on confidence scores, DeeAD terminates inference when predicted trajectories align with lightweight planning priors (e.g., Navigation or Low-precision Planning) within a tolerable deviation (<2m). To improve efficiency, we introduce a multi-hop controller that adaptively skips redundant layers based on the change rate of scores. DeeAD integrates into existing VLA models, such as ORION, without requiring retraining. Experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate up to 28% transformer-layer sparsity and 29% latency reduction, while preserving planning quality and safety.

### [4] [DinoLizer: Learning from the Best for Generative Inpainting Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20722)
*Minh Thong Doi,Jan Butora,Vincent Itier,Jérémie Boulanger,Patrick Bas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DinoLizer 是一种基于 DINOv2 的模型，用于定位生成式修补（inpainting）中的篡改区域。它在 B-Free 数据集上预训练的 DINOv2 模型基础上，添加了一个线性分类头，以 14×14 的补丁分辨率预测篡改区域。该方法通过滑动窗口策略处理大图像，并对热图进行后处理以生成二值篡改掩码。实验表明，DinoLizer 在多个生成式修补数据集上超越了现有最佳模型，且对重采样、噪声和 JPEG 压缩等常见后处理操作具有鲁棒性，平均 IoU 提升达 12%，且经后处理后性能更优。对比实验证明 DINOv2 和 DINOv3 在深度伪造检测任务中，DinoLizer 表现更佳。代码将在论文接受后公开。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在检测生成式修补造成的局部篡改方面存在局限，尤其对复杂后处理操作不够鲁棒。需要一种能有效识别语义上被修改区域、并保持高精度与鲁棒性的新方法。

Method: 基于 DINOv2 模型，在其视觉变换器的补丁嵌入上添加线性分类头，实现 14×14 分辨率的篡改检测；采用滑动窗口策略处理大图像，生成热图并进行后处理以优化二值掩码；通过在 B-Free 数据集上预训练的模型获取强表征能力。

Result: DinoLizer 在多个生成式修补数据集上表现优于现有最先进方法，平均 IoU 提升 12%；对重采样、噪声、JPEG 压缩等后处理操作具有强鲁棒性；相比 DINOv2 与 DINOv3 的其他变体，在深度伪造定位任务中展现出更强性能。

Conclusion: DinoLizer 充分利用了 DINOv2 的强大表征能力，通过轻量级分类头与滑动窗口策略实现了高效、精准且鲁棒的局部篡改定位，为生成内容真实性检测提供了新的有效方案。

Abstract: We introduce DinoLizer, a DINOv2-based model for localizing manipulated regions in generative inpainting. Our method builds on a DINOv2 model pretrained to detect synthetic images on the B-Free dataset. We add a linear classification head on top of the Vision Transformer's patch embeddings to predict manipulations at a $14\times 14$ patch resolution. The head is trained to focus on semantically altered regions, treating non-semantic edits as part of the original content. Because the ViT accepts only fixed-size inputs, we use a sliding-window strategy to aggregate predictions over larger images; the resulting heatmaps are post-processed to refine the estimated binary manipulation masks. Empirical results show that DinoLizer surpasses state-of-the-art local manipulation detectors on a range of inpainting datasets derived from different generative models. It remains robust to common post-processing operations such as resizing, noise addition, and JPEG (double) compression. On average, DinoLizer achieves a 12\% higher Intersection-over-Union (IoU) than the next best model, with even greater gains after post-processing. Our experiments with off-the-shelf DINOv2 demonstrate the strong representational power of Vision Transformers for this task. Finally, extensive ablation studies comparing DINOv2 and its successor, DINOv3, in deepfake localization confirm DinoLizer's superiority. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

### [5] [CANVAS: A Benchmark for Vision-Language Models on Tool-Based User Interface Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20737)
*Daeheon Jeong,Seoyeon Byun,Kihoon Son,Dae Hyun Kim,Juho Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了CANVAS，一个用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在基于工具的用户界面（UI）设计中表现的基准。该基准包含598个任务，涵盖30种功能类别，分为设计复现和设计修改两类，通过上下文相关的工具调用逐步更新设计。实验表明领先模型展现出更策略性的工具调用，提升了设计质量，并识别出常见错误模式，为未来研究提供方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏评估视觉语言模型在设计软件中进行迭代式操作能力的基准，限制了对模型协作潜力的理解，因此需要建立一个系统化的评估框架以揭示其在真实设计流程中的表现。

Method: 构建CANVAS基准，包含598个基于工具的UI设计任务，从3.3K个移动UI设计中采样，覆盖30类功能；任务分为设计复现与设计修改两类；通过上下文感知的工具调用（如创建矩形作为按钮背景）模拟实际设计过程；使用真实参考设计评估模型输出。

Result: 领先的视觉语言模型在工具调用上表现出更强的策略性，显著提升了设计质量；同时识别出模型常见的错误模式，如误操作、忽略上下文或工具顺序错误，这些可作为改进依据。

Conclusion: CANVAS为评估VLM在工具驱动的UI设计中的能力提供了首个系统化基准，揭示了现有模型的潜力与局限，为未来提升模型与设计师协同能力的研究指明方向。

Abstract: User interface (UI) design is an iterative process in which designers progressively refine their work with design software such as Figma or Sketch. Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) with tool invocation suggest these models can operate design software to edit a UI design through iteration. Understanding and enhancing this capacity is important, as it highlights VLMs' potential to collaborate with designers within conventional software. However, as no existing benchmark evaluates tool-based design performance, the capacity remains unknown. To address this, we introduce CANVAS, a benchmark for VLMs on tool-based user interface design. Our benchmark contains 598 tool-based design tasks paired with ground-truth references sampled from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 function-based categories (e.g., onboarding, messaging). In each task, a VLM updates the design step-by-step through context-based tool invocations (e.g., create a rectangle as a button background), linked to design software. Specifically, CANVAS incorporates two task types: (i) design replication evaluates the ability to reproduce a whole UI screen; (ii) design modification evaluates the ability to modify a specific part of an existing screen. Results suggest that leading models exhibit more strategic tool invocations, improving design quality. Furthermore, we identify common error patterns models exhibit, guiding future work in enhancing tool-based design capabilities.

### [6] [Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20770)
*Raghuveer Thirukovalluru,Xiaochuang Han,Bhuwan Dhingra,Emily Dinan,Maha Elbayad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE)，通过文本查询条件化生成图像表示，解决了传统图像编码器在下游任务中缺乏语义对齐的问题。TIE在多个图像到文本基准测试中显著提升性能（1B和3B模型分别提升1.5和1.3点，部分任务最高提升6点），同时仅需一半图像块（token），大幅提高推理效率。该方法在通用查询下也表现良好，增强了模型的可解释性与查询相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像编码器在预训练时独立于语言模型，处理图像时忽略具体任务或文本查询，导致语义对齐不足，影响视觉-语言模型的性能与可解释性。

Method: 提出Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE)，使图像编码过程受输入文本查询引导，生成与查询相关的图像表示，并通过条件化训练优化编码器对关键视觉特征的捕捉能力。

Result: TIE在九个图像到文本基准上平均提升1.5至1.3点（1B与3B模型），最高提升达6点；仅使用一半图像令牌，显著提升推理效率；在通用查询下仍具良好泛化能力，且注意力集中于与查询相关的视觉区域。

Conclusion: TIE通过文本条件化机制有效提升了视觉-语言模型的性能、效率与可解释性，为图像编码器的动态适应提供了新范式。

Abstract: Image encoders, a fundamental component of vision-language models (VLMs), are typically pretrained independently before being aligned with a language model. This standard paradigm results in encoders that process images agnostically, without regard to the specific downstream task or text query. To address this limitation, we propose the Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE), which generates image representations conditioned on the input text query. VLMs equipped with TIE outperform their conventional counterparts by +1.5 and +1.3 points on average across nine image-to-text benchmarks at the 1B and 3B scales, respectively, with gains reaching up to 6 points on tasks such as DocVQA and InfoVQA. Moreover, TIE-based VLMs attain superior performance while utilizing only half as many image tiles (tokens), resulting in notably improved inference efficiency. TIE also generalizes well with generic queries, indicating that text-conditioned training effectively optimizes the encoder to capture key visual features. Qualitative analysis confirms that TIE consistently attends to query-relevant regions, enhancing both interpretability and query-specific grounding.

### [7] [LongVT: Incentivizing "Thinking with Long Videos" via Native Tool Calling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20785)
*Zuhao Yang,Sudong Wang,Kaichen Zhang,Keming Wu,Sicong Leng,Yifan Zhang,Chengwei Qin,Shijian Lu,Xingxuan Li,Lidong Bing*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongVT is an end-to-end agentic framework for long-video reasoning that mimics human comprehension by combining global skimming and local detail analysis. It uses multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought to iteratively refine video clips using LMMs' temporal grounding ability, improving answer accuracy and reducing hallucinations. The framework is trained on a newly curated dataset named VideoSIAH with 247.9K supervised samples, 1.6K reinforcement learning samples, and 15.4K fine-tuning samples, and evaluated on 1,280 QA pairs. LongVT outperforms existing baselines across four benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large multimodal models (LMMs) are prone to hallucinations when reasoning over long-form videos due to sparse and temporally dispersed evidence. Human-like comprehension involves first skimming the entire video globally and then focusing on relevant segments—this inspires the need for a more robust, structured reasoning framework.

Method: LongVT employs an interleaved global-to-local reasoning loop: it leverages LMMs' inherent temporal grounding capability as a native video cropping tool to extract and resample finer-grained frames from specific clips. This process repeats iteratively until answers are grounded in visual evidence. A three-stage training strategy integrates cold-start supervised fine-tuning, agentic reinforcement learning, and agentic reinforcement fine-tuning.

Result: LongVT achieves state-of-the-art performance across four challenging long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. It significantly reduces hallucinations and improves answer grounding through its iterative, evidence-driven reasoning process.

Conclusion: LongVT effectively enhances long-video reasoning by enabling LMMs to think like humans—first scanning broadly, then zooming into details. The framework, supported by the new VideoSIAH dataset and open-source release, sets a new benchmark for reliable and accurate long-video understanding.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown great potential for video reasoning with textual Chain-of-Thought. However, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, especially when processing long-form videos where evidence is sparse and temporally dispersed. Inspired by how humans comprehend long videos - by first skimming globally and then examining relevant clips for details - we introduce LongVT, an end-to-end agentic framework that enables "Thinking with Long Videos" via interleaved Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought. Specifically, we exploit LMMs' inherent temporal grounding ability as a native video cropping tool to zoom in on a specific video clip and resample finer-grained video frames. This global-to-local reasoning loop continues until answers are grounded in retrieved visual evidence. Given the scarcity of fine-grained question-answering (QA) data for the long video reasoning task, we curate and will release a data suite named VideoSIAH to facilitate both training and evaluation. Specifically, our training dataset consists of 247.9K samples for tool-integrated cold-start supervised fine-tuning, 1.6K samples for agentic reinforcement learning, and 15.4K samples for agentic reinforcement fine-tuning, respectively. Our evaluation benchmark consists of 1,280 QA pairs that are carefully curated through a semi-automatic data pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation. With a meticulously designed three-stage training strategy and extensive empirical validation, LongVT consistently outperforms existing strong baselines across four challenging long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. Our codes, data, and model checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/LongVT .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StM提出一种新颖的生成视频组合框架，通过将大量未标注视频分割为动态前景和背景层，并自组合学习动态主体与场景的交互，解决数据稀缺问题。引入感知变换的训练流程与多层融合增强，实现功能感知的组合，并通过身份保持损失确保前景在融合中不失真。实验表明，StM在定量和定性评估中均优于现有最先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成视频方法依赖标注数据或手工规则，面临数据稀缺和控制力不足的问题。需要一种无需标注、能有效学习复杂视频组合动态的新方法。

Method: StM首先将大规模未标注视频分解为动态前景和背景层，通过自组合学习主体与场景间的交互；采用多层融合与增强的变换感知训练流程，结合身份保持损失以保证前景特征在合成过程中的完整性。

Result: StM在量化指标和人类及视觉语言模型（VLLM）的定性评估中均超越当前最先进的方法，表现出更强的生成真实感与可控性。

Conclusion: StM为生成视频提供了有效的无监督学习范式，显著提升了视频合成的可控性与真实性，适用于复杂场景下的动态内容生成任务。

Abstract: We present Split-then-Merge (StM), a novel framework designed to enhance control in generative video composition and address its data scarcity problem. Unlike conventional methods relying on annotated datasets or handcrafted rules, StM splits a large corpus of unlabeled videos into dynamic foreground and background layers, then self-composes them to learn how dynamic subjects interact with diverse scenes. This process enables the model to learn the complex compositional dynamics required for realistic video generation. StM introduces a novel transformation-aware training pipeline that utilizes a multi-layer fusion and augmentation to achieve affordance-aware composition, alongside an identity-preservation loss that maintains foreground fidelity during blending. Experiments show StM outperforms SoTA methods in both quantitative benchmarks and in humans/VLLM-based qualitative evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉推理基准在覆盖认知核心能力方面存在不足，缺乏可验证的真值解和大规模数据生成能力，限制了模型评估与训练。需要一种能够系统性生成多样化、可验证推理任务的合成环境，以推动视觉-语言模型在复杂认知任务上的发展。

Result: 评估表明，当前最先进的大型视觉-语言模型（如GPT-5）在Sphinx基准上仅达到51.1%的准确率，显著低于人类水平。而使用RLVR方法后，模型在该基准及外部视觉推理任务中均获得显著性能提升，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: Sphinx 提供了一个强大且可扩展的合成环境，可用于评估和训练多模态模型在核心认知推理任务上的能力。结合可验证奖励的强化学习策略，能有效提升模型的视觉推理性能，为未来多模态智能系统的发展提供了重要方向。

Abstract: We present Sphinx, a synthetic environment for visual perception and reasoning that targets core cognitive primitives. Sphinx procedurally generates puzzles using motifs, tiles, charts, icons, and geometric primitives, each paired with verifiable ground-truth solutions, enabling both precise evaluation and large-scale dataset construction. The benchmark covers 25 task types spanning symmetry detection, geometric transformations, spatial reasoning, chart interpretation, and sequence prediction. Evaluating recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) shows that even state-of-the-art GPT-5 attains only 51.1% accuracy, well below human performance. Finally, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) substantially improves model accuracy on these tasks and yields gains on external visual reasoning benchmarks, highlighting its promise for advancing multimodal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床应用中，如诊断、治疗规划和手术导航，准确检测血管树的中心线并维持正确的树状拓扑至关重要。特别是高召回率必不可少，因为遗漏微小分支可能导致严重误判或漏诊。现有方法在精度与参数效率之间存在权衡，亟需一种既能保证高召回又能高效生成精确中心线图的新方法。

Conclusion: RefTr是一种高效、高精度且高召回率的3D血管树中心线生成框架，其递归精炼机制与轻量化设计使其成为当前医学图像分析领域血管树建模的强有力候选方案，有望推动临床辅助诊断与手术导航的发展。

Abstract: Tubular trees, such as blood vessels and lung airways, are essential for material transport within the human body. Accurately detecting their centerlines with correct tree topology is critical for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. In these applications, maintaining high recall is crucial, as missing small branches can result in fatal mistakes caused by incomplete assessments or undetected abnormalities. We present RefTr, a 3D image-to-graph model for centerline generation of vascular trees via recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories. RefTr uses a Producer-Refiner architecture based on a Transformer decoder, where the Producer proposes a set of initial confluent trajectories that are recurrently refined by the Refiner to produce final trajectories, which forms the centerline graph. The confluent trajectory representation enables refinement of complete trajectories while explicitly enforcing a valid tree topology. The recurrent refinement scheme improves precision and reuses the same Refiner block across multiple steps, yielding a 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters compared to previous SOTA. We also introduce an efficient non-maximum suppression algorithm for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches and boost precision. Across multiple public centerline datasets, RefTr achieves superior recall and comparable precision to previous SOTA, while offering faster inference and substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating its potential as a new state-of-the-art framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging.

Conclusion: 本研究构建了首个大规模、高保真、真实光学条件下的双目DSLR数据集，有效填补了合成数据与真实世界之间的鸿沟，为后续基于真实光学的视觉算法研究提供了可靠基础，推动了可复现的现实世界泛化能力研究。

Abstract: Reliable depth estimation under real optical conditions remains a core challenge for camera vision in systems such as autonomous robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent progress in depth estimation and depth-of-field rendering, research remains constrained by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity, real stereo DSLR datasets, limiting real-world generalization and evaluation of models trained on synthetic data as shown extensively in literature. We present the first high-resolution (5472$\times$3648px) stereo DSLR dataset with 18000 images, systematically varying focal length and aperture across complex real scenes and capturing the optical realism and complexity of professional camera systems. For 9 scenes with varying scene complexity, lighting and background, images are captured with two identical camera assemblies at 10 focal lengths (28-70mm) and 5 apertures (f/2.8-f/22), spanning 50 optical configurations in 2000 images per scene. This full-range optics coverage enables controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects for monocular and stereo depth estimation, shallow depth-of-field rendering, deblurring, 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Each focal configuration has a dedicated calibration image set, supporting evaluation of classical and learning based methods for intrinsic and extrinsic calibration. The dataset features challenging visual elements such as multi-scale optical illusions, reflective surfaces, mirrors, transparent glass walls, fine-grained details, and natural / artificial ambient light variations. This work attempts to bridge the realism gap between synthetic training data and real camera optics, and demonstrates challenges with the current state-of-the-art monocular, stereo depth and depth-of-field methods. We release the dataset, calibration files, and evaluation code to support reproducible research on real-world optical generalization.

Abstract: Visual content memorability has intrigued the scientific community for decades, with applications ranging widely, from understanding nuanced aspects of human memory to enhancing content design. A significant challenge in progressing the field lies in the expensive process of collecting memorability annotations from humans. This limits the diversity and scalability of datasets for modeling visual content memorability. Most existing datasets are limited to collecting aggregate memorability scores for visual content, not capturing the nuanced memorability signals present in natural, open-ended recall descriptions. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale unsupervised dataset designed explicitly for modeling visual memorability signals, containing over 82,000 videos, accompanied by descriptive recall data. We leverage tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) retrieval queries from online platforms such as Reddit. We demonstrate that our unsupervised dataset provides rich signals for two memorability-related tasks: recall generation and ToT retrieval. Large vision-language models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions for visual content. We also employ a contrastive training strategy to create the first model capable of performing multimodal ToT retrieval. Our dataset and models present a novel direction, facilitating progress in visual content memorability research.

Abstract: We propose a method which, given a sequence of stereo foggy images, estimates the parameters of a fog model and updates them dynamically. In contrast with previous approaches, which estimate the parameters sequentially and thus are prone to error propagation, our algorithm estimates all the parameters simultaneously by solving a novel optimisation problem. By assuming that fog is only locally homogeneous, our method effectively handles real-world fog, which is often globally inhomogeneous. The proposed algorithm can be easily used as an add-on module in existing visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) or odometry systems in the presence of fog. In order to assess our method, we also created a new dataset, the Stereo Driving In Real Fog (SDIRF), consisting of high-quality, consecutive stereo frames of real, foggy road scenes under a variety of visibility conditions, totalling over 40 minutes and 34k frames. As a first-of-its-kind, SDIRF contains the camera's photometric parameters calibrated in a lab environment, which is a prerequisite for correctly applying the atmospheric scattering model to foggy images. The dataset also includes the counterpart clear data of the same routes recorded in overcast weather, which is useful for companion work in image defogging and depth reconstruction. We conducted extensive experiments using both synthetic foggy data and real foggy sequences from SDIRF to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over prior methods. Our method not only produces the most accurate estimates on synthetic data, but also adapts better to real fog. We make our code and SDIRF publicly available\footnote{https://github.com/SenseRoboticsLab/estimating-fog-parameters} to the community with the aim of advancing the research on visual perception in fog.

Motivation: 现有分割模型如 SAM2 难以直接应用于跨视角物体对应任务，因其面临剧烈视角和外观变化带来的挑战，亟需一种能够有效建立跨视角一致关联的新方法。

Method: 提出 V^2-SAM 框架，包含两个提示生成器：(1) 基于 DINOv3 特征的跨视角锚点提示生成器（V^2-Anchor），实现几何感知对应并首次支持坐标式提示；(2) 跨视角视觉提示生成器（V^2-Visual），通过新颖的视觉提示匹配器在特征与结构层面对齐双视角表示。采用多专家架构并引入后处理循环一致性选择器（PCCS）以自适应选择最可靠专家。

Conclusion: V^2-SAM 成功将 SAM2 扩展至跨视角物体对应任务，通过几何与外观双线索融合及自适应选择机制，显著提升跨视角一致性匹配精度，为复杂视觉场景中的物体追踪与机器人交互提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Cross-view object correspondence, exemplified by the representative task of ego-exo object correspondence, aims to establish consistent associations of the same object across different viewpoints (e.g., ego-centric and exo-centric). This task poses significant challenges due to drastic viewpoint and appearance variations, making existing segmentation models, such as SAM2, non-trivial to apply directly. To address this, we present V^2-SAM, a unified cross-view object correspondence framework that adapts SAM2 from single-view segmentation to cross-view correspondence through two complementary prompt generators. Specifically, the Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor), built upon DINOv3 features, establishes geometry-aware correspondences and, for the first time, unlocks coordinate-based prompting for SAM2 in cross-view scenarios, while the Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) enhances appearance-guided cues via a novel visual prompt matcher that aligns ego-exo representations from both feature and structural perspectives. To effectively exploit the strengths of both prompts, we further adopt a multi-expert design and introduce a Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) that adaptively selects the most reliable expert based on cyclic consistency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of V^2-SAM, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence).

### [15] [Test-Time Alignment of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models via Null-Text Embedding Optimisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20889)
*Taehoon Kim,Henry Gouk,Timothy Hospedales*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Null-TTA proposes optimizing the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance for test-time alignment, avoiding reward hacking by leveraging semantic coherence, achieving state-of-the-art performance and strong cross-reward generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTA methods often under- or over-optimize target rewards, leading to reward hacking through non-semantic noise manipulation; a more principled approach is needed.

Method: Null-TTA optimizes the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance to steer the generative distribution toward target rewards without updating model parameters.

Result: Null-TTA achieves state-of-the-art test-time alignment performance and maintains strong generalization across different rewards.

Conclusion: Semantic-space optimization via unconditional embedding tuning establishes a principled and effective paradigm for test-time alignment in diffusion models.

Abstract: Test-time alignment (TTA) aims to adapt models to specific rewards during inference. However, existing methods tend to either under-optimise or over-optimise (reward hack) the target reward function. We propose Null-Text Test-Time Alignment (Null-TTA), which aligns diffusion models by optimising the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance, rather than manipulating latent or noise variables. Due to the structured semantic nature of the text embedding space, this ensures alignment occurs on a semantically coherent manifold and prevents reward hacking (exploiting non-semantic noise patterns to improve the reward). Since the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance serves as the anchor for the model's generative distribution, Null-TTA directly steers model's generative distribution towards the target reward rather than just adjusting the samples, even without updating model parameters. Thanks to these desirable properties, we show that Null-TTA achieves state-of-the-art target test-time alignment while maintaining strong cross-reward generalisation. This establishes semantic-space optimisation as an effective and principled novel paradigm for TTA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了一种深度学习（DL）模型在降低脑桥小脑角（CPA）池对比增强T1加权MRI（T1ce）造影剂剂量方面的效果。通过多中心回顾性研究，利用听神经瘤患者的数据模拟低剂量T1ce，并训练DL模型从低剂量图像恢复标准剂量T1ce。结果显示，随着输入剂量增加，恢复图像的结构相似性指数和信噪比显著提升；在10%输入剂量下，使用DL恢复的T1ce进行分割，其Dice系数、95%豪斯多夫距离和平均表面距离均明显改善。放射科医生评价显示，10%和30%输入剂量下的恢复图像质量优秀，尤其30%更具诊断信息量。结论：DL模型显著提升了低剂量MRI图像质量，使仅用标准剂量10%-30%即可实现病灶检测与诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低对比增强MRI中造影剂剂量可减少患者风险，但可能牺牲图像质量。因此需要一种有效方法在低剂量条件下仍能获得高质量图像，以支持准确诊断。本研究旨在探索深度学习技术是否能够通过图像恢复弥补低剂量带来的质量损失。

Method: 采用多中心回顾性研究设计，基于听神经瘤患者的原始T1和标准剂量T1ce图像，模拟不同比例（如10%、30%等）的低剂量T1ce数据。训练深度学习模型将低剂量图像重建为接近标准剂量的图像。随后对重建图像的图像质量（结构相似性指数、信噪比）、分割性能（Dice系数、豪斯多夫距离、平均表面距离）以及放射科医生的主观评价进行综合评估。

Result: 随着输入剂量提高，重建图像的结构相似性指数从0.639±0.113升至0.993±0.009，信噪比从21.6±3.73 dB增至41.4±4.84 dB。在10%输入剂量下，分割性能显著改善：Dice系数由0.673提升至0.734，95%豪斯多夫距离由2.38 mm降至2.07 mm，平均表面距离由1.00 mm降至0.59 mm。主观评分表明，10%和30%输入剂量下的重建图像均达到优秀水平，其中30%更优。

Conclusion: 深度学习模型可有效提升低剂量脑桥小脑角MRI图像质量，使得仅使用标准造影剂剂量的10%–30%即可实现病灶检测与临床诊断，具有重要的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate a deep learning (DL) model for reducing the agent dose of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (T1ce) of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cistern. Materials and methods: In this multi-center retrospective study, T1 and T1ce of vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients were used to simulate low-dose T1ce with varying reductions of contrast agent dose. DL models were trained to restore standard-dose T1ce from the low-dose simulation. The image quality and segmentation performance of the DL-restored T1ce were evaluated. A head and neck radiologist was asked to rate DL-restored images in multiple aspects, including image quality and diagnostic characterization. Results: 203 MRI studies from 72 VS patients (mean age, 58.51 \pm 14.73, 39 men) were evaluated. As the input dose increased, the structural similarity index measure of the restored T1ce increased from 0.639 \pm 0.113 to 0.993 \pm 0.009, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio increased from 21.6 \pm 3.73 dB to 41.4 \pm 4.84 dB. At 10% input dose, using DL-restored T1ce for segmentation improved the Dice from 0.673 to 0.734, the 95% Hausdorff distance from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and the average surface distance from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm. Both DL-restored T1ce from 10% and 30% input doses showed excellent images, with the latter being considered more informative. Conclusion: The DL model improved the image quality of low-dose MRI of the CPA cistern, which makes lesion detection and diagnostic characterization possible with 10% - 30% of the standard dose.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频中存在天然的时间连贯性，但轻量级模型难以有效捕捉复杂的时间动态。现有方法对时间结构建模不足，导致模型在处理视频时易产生不合理的表示突变。因此需要一种机制来强化时间上的平滑性，以提升模型对时间信息的利用效率。

Method: 将连续帧的中间层嵌入变化建模为高斯随机游走（GRW），通过引入平滑正则项，对表示变化的加速度进行惩罚，从而鼓励低加速的稳定表示演化，增强时间一致性。该正则化可无缝集成到现有轻量级视频模型中。

Result: 在Kinetics-600数据集上，所提方法使轻量级模型准确率提升3.8%至6.4%；MoViNets在相同FLOP限制下达到新最优（+3.8%至+6.1%）；MobileNetV3与MoViNets-Stream在相近内存开销下实现4.9%至6.4%的性能跃升。

Conclusion: 平滑正则化通过引入时间上的高斯随机游走先验，有效增强了轻量级视频模型对时间动态的建模能力，显著提升了性能，同时保持高效计算，是视频理解中时间归纳偏置设计的有效范例。

Abstract: We propose a smooth regularization technique that instills a strong temporal inductive bias in video recognition models, particularly benefiting lightweight architectures. Our method encourages smoothness in the intermediate-layer embeddings of consecutive frames by modeling their changes as a Gaussian Random Walk (GRW). This penalizes abrupt representational shifts, thereby promoting low-acceleration solutions that better align with the natural temporal coherence inherent in videos. By leveraging this enforced smoothness, lightweight models can more effectively capture complex temporal dynamics. Applied to such models, our technique yields a 3.8% to 6.4% accuracy improvement on Kinetics-600. Notably, the MoViNets model family trained with our smooth regularization improves the current state of the art by 3.8% to 6.1% within their respective FLOP constraints, while MobileNetV3 and the MoViNets-Stream family achieve gains of 4.9% to 6.4% over prior state-of-the-art models with comparable memory footprints.

Conclusion: UruDendro4是首个支持多高度年轮标注的公开树轮数据集，为树轮自动检测与年木材积建模提供了高质量数据基础，推动了相关研究的自动化与精准化发展。

Abstract: Tree-ring growth represents the annual wood increment for a tree, and quantifying it allows researchers to assess which silvicultural practices are best suited for each species. Manual measurement of this growth is time-consuming and often imprecise, as it is typically performed along 4 to 8 radial directions on a cross-sectional disc. In recent years, automated algorithms and datasets have emerged to enhance accuracy and automate the delineation of annual rings in cross-sectional images.
  To address the scarcity of wood cross-section data, we introduce the UruDendro4 dataset, a collection of 102 image samples of Pinus taeda L., each manually annotated with annual growth rings. Unlike existing public datasets, UruDendro4 includes samples extracted at multiple heights along the stem, allowing for the volumetric modeling of annual growth using manually delineated rings. This dataset (images and annotations) allows the development of volumetric models for annual wood estimation based on cross-sectional imagery.
  Additionally, we provide a performance baseline for automatic ring detection on this dataset using state-of-the-art methods. The highest performance was achieved by the DeepCS-TRD method, with a mean Average Precision of 0.838, a mean Average Recall of 0.782, and an Adapted Rand Error score of 0.084. A series of ablation experiments were conducted to empirically validate the final parameter configuration. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that training a learning model including this dataset improves the model's generalization in the tree-ring detection task.

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation (RRG) for breast ultrasound (BUS) is limited by the lack of paired image-report datasets and the risk of hallucinations from large language models. We propose BUSTR, a multitask vision-language framework that generates BUS reports without requiring paired image-report supervision. BUSTR constructs reports from structured descriptors (e.g., BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features, learns descriptor-aware visual representations with a multi-head Swin encoder trained using a multitask loss over dataset-specific descriptor sets, and aligns visual and textual tokens via a dual-level objective that combines token-level cross-entropy with a cosine-similarity alignment loss between input and output representations. We evaluate BUSTR on two public BUS datasets, BrEaST and BUS-BRA, which differ in size and available descriptors. Across both datasets, BUSTR consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics, particularly for key targets such as BI-RADS category and pathology. Our results show that this descriptor-aware vision model, trained with a combined token-level and alignment loss, improves both automatic report metrics and clinical efficacy without requiring paired image-report data.

Conclusion: 本工作为视觉理解引入了新方向，强调表达性和用户意图，而非单纯追求现实主义，展示了基于真实用户行为建模图像合成的潜力。

Abstract: As a widely used operation in image editing workflows, image composition has traditionally been studied with a focus on achieving visual realism and semantic plausibility. However, in practical editing scenarios of the modern content creation landscape, many compositions are not intended to preserve realism. Instead, users of online platforms motivated by gaining community recognition often aim to create content that is more artistic, playful, or socially engaging. Taking inspiration from this observation, we define the expressive composition task, a new formulation of image composition that embraces stylistic diversity and looser placement logic, reflecting how users edit images on real-world creative platforms. To address this underexplored problem, we present StickerNet, a two-stage framework that first determines the composition type, then predicts placement parameters such as opacity, mask, location, and scale accordingly. Unlike prior work that constructs datasets by simulating object placements on real images, we directly build our dataset from 1.8 million editing actions collected on an anonymous online visual creation and editing platform, each reflecting user-community validated placement decisions. This grounding in authentic editing behavior ensures strong alignment between task definition and training supervision. User studies and quantitative evaluations show that StickerNet outperforms common baselines and closely matches human placement behavior, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning from real-world editing patterns despite the inherent ambiguity of the task. This work introduces a new direction in visual understanding that emphasizes expressiveness and user intent over realism.

### [21] [TrafficLens: Multi-Camera Traffic Video Analysis Using LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20965)
*Md Adnan Arefeen,Biplob Debnath,Srimat Chakradhar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrafficLens is a novel algorithm designed to accelerate video-to-text conversion for multi-camera traffic intersections by leveraging overlapping camera views and intelligent VLM usage. It reduces processing time by up to 4× while preserving accuracy through iterative prompting and redundancy detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for analyzing multi-camera traffic video data are slow due to the need to process large volumes of video through Vision-Language Models (VLMs), especially when using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with Large Language Models (LLMs). The bottleneck lies in converting video into text, which is time-consuming and delays incident response and traffic insights.

Method: TrafficLens uses a sequential approach across overlapping camera coverage areas. It applies VLMs iteratively with varying token limits, reusing prior outputs as prompts for subsequent cameras. An object-level similarity detector avoids redundant VLM calls by identifying repeated or similar objects across views, thus optimizing efficiency.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to 4× compared to conventional methods, while maintaining high information accuracy and enabling faster incident investigation and traffic monitoring.

Conclusion: TrafficLens effectively addresses the challenge of timely analysis of multi-camera traffic videos by intelligently reducing redundant computations and leveraging iterative, context-aware VLM processing, making it suitable for real-time urban traffic management systems.

Abstract: Traffic cameras are essential in urban areas, playing a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. Multiple cameras at intersections enhance law enforcement capabilities, traffic management, and pedestrian safety. However, efficiently managing and analyzing multi-camera feeds poses challenges due to the vast amount of data. Analyzing such huge video data requires advanced analytical tools. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, excel in text-based tasks, integrating them into traffic video analysis demands converting video data into text using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), which is time-consuming and delays the timely utilization of traffic videos for generating insights and investigating incidents. To address these challenges, we propose TrafficLens, a tailored algorithm for multi-camera traffic intersections. TrafficLens employs a sequential approach, utilizing overlapping coverage areas of cameras. It iteratively applies VLMs with varying token limits, using previous outputs as prompts for subsequent cameras, enabling rapid generation of detailed textual descriptions while reducing processing time. Additionally, TrafficLens intelligently bypasses redundant VLM invocations through an object-level similarity detector. Experimental results with real-world datasets demonstrate that TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to $4\times$ while maintaining information accuracy.

*Al Amin,Kamrul Hasan,Liang Hong,Sharif Ullah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种结合视觉变换器（ViT）与同态加密（HE）的隐私保护联邦学习框架，用于多机构病理图像分类。通过使用ViT的CLS token作为紧凑特征表示，并采用CKKS同态加密进行加密传输，实现了30倍通信量减少，同时有效抵御模型反演攻击。实验表明，传统梯度加密易受攻击（PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999），而该方法在加密域仍保持90.02%分类准确率，兼顾安全与性能。

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning across healthcare institutions promises improved diagnostic accuracy by leveraging diverse datasets, yet privacy regulations such as HIPAA prohibit direct patient data sharing. While federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training without raw data exchange, recent studies show that model gradients in conventional FL remain vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, potentially exposing sensitive medical information. This paper presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure multi-institutional histopathology classification. The approach leverages the ViT CLS token as a compact 768-dimensional feature representation for secure aggregation, encrypting these tokens using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to the server. We demonstrate that encrypting CLS tokens achieves a 30-fold communication reduction compared to gradient encryption while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. Through evaluation on a three-client federated setup for lung cancer histopathology classification, we show that gradients are highly susceptible to model inversion attacks (PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741), enabling near-perfect image reconstruction. In contrast, the proposed CLS-protected HE approach prevents such attacks while enabling encrypted inference directly on ciphertexts, requiring only 326 KB of encrypted data transmission per aggregation round. The framework achieves 96.12 percent global classification accuracy in the unencrypted domain and 90.02 percent in the encrypted domain.

Abstract: Style transfer, a pivotal task in image processing, synthesizes visually compelling images by seamlessly blending realistic content with artistic styles, enabling applications in photo editing and creative design. While mainstream training-free diffusion-based methods have greatly advanced style transfer in recent years, their reliance on computationally inversion processes compromises efficiency and introduces visual distortions when inversion is inaccurate. To address these limitations, we propose a novel \textit{inversion-free} style transfer framework based on dual rectified flows, which tackles the challenge of finding an unknown stylized distribution from two distinct inputs (content and style images), \textit{only with forward pass}. Our approach predicts content and style trajectories in parallel, then fuses them through a dynamic midpoint interpolation that integrates velocities from both paths while adapting to the evolving stylized image. By jointly modeling the content, style, and stylized distributions, our velocity field design achieves robust fusion and avoids the shortcomings of naive overlays. Attention injection further guides style integration, enhancing visual fidelity, content preservation, and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate generalization across diverse styles and content, providing an effective and efficient pipeline for style transfer.

Abstract: Referring Camouflaged Object Detection (Ref-COD) segments specified camouflaged objects in a scene by leveraging a small set of referring images. Though effective, current systems adopt a dual-branch design that requires reference images at test time, which limits deployability and adds latency and data-collection burden. We introduce a Ref-COD framework that distills references into a class-prototype memory during training and synthesizes a reference vector at inference via a query-conditioned mixture of prototypes. Concretely, we maintain an EMA-updated prototype per category and predict mixture weights from the query to produce a guidance vector without any test-time references. To bridge the representation gap between reference statistics and camouflaged query features, we propose a bidirectional attention alignment module that adapts both the query features and the class representation. Thus, our approach yields a simple, efficient path to Ref-COD without mandatory references. We evaluate the proposed method on the large-scale R2C7K benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate competitive or superior performance of the proposed method compared with recent state-of-the-arts. Code is available at https://github.com/yuhuan-wu/RefOnce.

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are increasingly deployed for vision-language tasks that produce explicit intermediate rationales. However, reasoning traces can contain unsafe content even when the final answer is non-harmful, creating deployment risks. Existing multimodal safety guards primarily evaluate only the input question and the final answer, neglecting the intermediate reasoning process. This oversight allows undetected harm, such as biased inferences or policy-violating use of visual context, to emerge during reasoning. We introduce GuardTrace-VL, a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors the full Question-Thinking-Answer (QTA) pipeline via joint image-text analysis, enabling detection of unsafe content as it emerges in the reasoning stage. To support training and evaluation, we construct the GuardTrace dataset, which is generated through diverse prompting strategies and refined via a MLRM- and human-based voting and verification pipeline. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage progressive training scheme combined with the data refinement process, enabling the model to learn nuanced and context-dependent safety preferences according to different risk levels. On our proposed test set covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, GuardTrace-VL model achieves an F1 score of 93.1% on unsafe reasoning detection tasks, representing a 13.5% improvement in F1 score compared to the previous strongest multimodal safety defense methods. The codes will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Images can be viewed as layered compositions, foreground objects over background, with potential occlusions. This layered representation enables independent editing of elements, offering greater flexibility for content creation. Despite the progress in large generative models, decomposing a single image into layers remains challenging due to limited methods and data. We observe a strong connection between layer decomposition and in/outpainting tasks, and propose adapting a diffusion-based inpainting model for layer decomposition using lightweight finetuning. To further preserve detail in the latent space, we introduce a novel multi-modal context fusion module with linear attention complexity. Our model is trained purely on a synthetic dataset constructed from open-source assets and achieves superior performance in object removal and occlusion recovery, unlocking new possibilities in downstream editing and creative applications.

Abstract: News image captioning aims to produce journalistically informative descriptions by combining visual content with contextual cues from associated articles. Despite recent advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: (1) incomplete information coverage, (2) weak cross-modal alignment, and (3) suboptimal visual-entity grounding. To address these issues, we introduce MERGE, the first Multimodal Entity-aware Retrieval-augmented GEneration framework for news image captioning. MERGE constructs an entity-centric multimodal knowledge base (EMKB) that integrates textual, visual, and structured knowledge, enabling enriched background retrieval. It improves cross-modal alignment through a multistage hypothesis-caption strategy and enhances visual-entity matching via dynamic retrieval guided by image content. Extensive experiments on GoodNews and NYTimes800k show that MERGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with CIDEr gains of +6.84 and +1.16 in caption quality, and F1-score improvements of +4.14 and +2.64 in named entity recognition. Notably, MERGE also generalizes well to the unseen Visual News dataset, achieving +20.17 in CIDEr and +6.22 in F1-score, demonstrating strong robustness and domain adaptability.

TL;DR: 本文提出MetaRank，一种基于元学习的自动、任务感知的模型迁移性评估（MTE）度量选择框架。通过将数据集和MTE度量的文本描述编码到共享语义空间，并利用离线训练的元预测器，根据目标数据集的文本描述高效排名候选度量，从而实现无需全量微调即可选择最优MTE度量。

Conclusion: MetaRank实现了对MTE度量的自动化、任务感知选择，克服了传统方法的局限性，为迁移学习中的模型选型提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate pre-trained source model is a critical, yet computationally expensive, task in transfer learning. Model Transferability Estimation (MTE) methods address this by providing efficient proxy metrics to rank models without full fine-tuning. In practice, the choice of which MTE metric to use is often ad hoc or guided simply by a metric's average historical performance. However, we observe that the effectiveness of MTE metrics is highly task-dependent and no single metric is universally optimal across all target datasets. To address this gap, we introduce MetaRank, a meta-learning framework for automatic, task-aware MTE metric selection. We formulate metric selection as a learning-to-rank problem. Rather than relying on conventional meta-features, MetaRank encodes textual descriptions of both datasets and MTE metrics using a pretrained language model, embedding them into a shared semantic space. A meta-predictor is then trained offline on diverse meta-tasks to learn the intricate relationship between dataset characteristics and metric mechanisms, optimized with a listwise objective that prioritizes correctly ranking the top-performing metrics. During the subsequent online phase, MetaRank efficiently ranks the candidate MTE metrics for a new, unseen target dataset based on its textual description, enabling practitioners to select the most appropriate metric a priori. Extensive experiments across 11 pretrained models and 11 target datasets demonstrate the strong effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Trustworthy multi-view classification (TMVC) addresses the challenge of achieving reliable decision-making in complex scenarios where multi-source information is heterogeneous, inconsistent, or even conflicting. Existing TMVC approaches predominantly rely on globally dense neighbor relationships to model intra-view dependencies, leading to high computational costs and an inability to directly ensure consistency across inter-view relationships. Furthermore, these methods typically aggregate evidence from different views through manually assigned weights, lacking guarantees that the learned multi-view neighbor structures are consistent within the class space, thus undermining the trustworthiness of classification outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel TMVC framework that introduces prototypes to represent the neighbor structures of each view. By simplifying the learning of intra-view neighbor relations and enabling dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view structure, our approach facilitates more efficient and consistent discovery of cross-view consensus. Extensive experiments on multiple public multi-view datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive downstream performance and robustness compared to prevalent TMVC methods.

Conclusion: CameraMaster提供了一种统一、可扩展且高精度的相机感知图像调色框架，为可控图像生成与编辑提供了新范式。

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have greatly advanced image editing and generation. However, achieving physically consistent image retouching with precise parameter control (e.g., exposure, white balance, zoom) remains challenging. Existing methods either rely solely on ambiguous and entangled text prompts, which hinders precise camera control, or train separate heads/weights for parameter adjustment, which compromises scalability, multi-parameter composition, and sensitivity to subtle variations. To address these limitations, we propose CameraMaster, a unified camera-aware framework for image retouching. The key idea is to explicitly decouple the camera directive and then coherently integrate two critical information streams: a directive representation that captures the photographer's intent, and a parameter embedding that encodes precise camera settings. CameraMaster first uses the camera parameter embedding to modulate both the camera directive and the content semantics. The modulated directive is then injected into the content features via cross-attention, yielding a strongly camera-sensitive semantic context. In addition, the directive and camera embeddings are injected as conditioning and gating signals into the time embedding, enabling unified, layer-wise modulation throughout the denoising process and enforcing tight semantic-parameter alignment. To train and evaluate CameraMaster, we construct a large-scale dataset of 78K image-prompt pairs annotated with camera parameters. Extensive experiments show that CameraMaster produces monotonic and near-linear responses to parameter variations, supports seamless multi-parameter composition, and significantly outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Image captions serve as efficient surrogates for visual content in multimodal systems such as retrieval, recommendation, and multi-step agentic inference pipelines. Yet current evaluation practices miss a fundamental question: Can captions stand-in for images in real downstream tasks? We propose a utility-based benchmark, CaptionQA, to evaluate model-generated captions, where caption quality is measured by how well it supports downstream tasks. CaptionQA is an extensible domain-dependent benchmark covering 4 domains--Natural, Document, E-commerce, and Embodied AI--each with fine-grained taxonomies (25 top-level and 69 subcategories) that identify useful information for domain-specific tasks. CaptionQA builds 33,027 densely annotated multiple-choice questions (50.3 per image on average) that explicitly require visual information to answer, providing a comprehensive probe of caption utility. In our evaluation protocol, an LLM answers these questions using captions alone, directly measuring whether captions preserve image-level utility and are utilizable by a downstream LLM. Evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals substantial gaps between the image and its caption utility. Notably, models nearly identical on traditional image-QA benchmarks lower by up to 32% in caption utility. We release CaptionQA along with an open-source pipeline for extension to new domains. The code is available at https://github.com/bronyayang/CaptionQA.

Conclusion: LungNoduleAgent is a promising foundational tool for clinical lung nodule analysis, highlighting the importance of region-level semantic alignment and multi-agent collaboration in enhancing diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: Diagnosing lung cancer typically involves physicians identifying lung nodules in Computed tomography (CT) scans and generating diagnostic reports based on their morphological features and medical expertise. Although advancements have been made in using multimodal large language models for analyzing lung CT scans, challenges remain in accurately describing nodule morphology and incorporating medical expertise. These limitations affect the reliability and effectiveness of these models in clinical settings. Collaborative multi-agent systems offer a promising strategy for achieving a balance between generality and precision in medical applications, yet their potential in pathology has not been thoroughly explored. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LungNoduleAgent, an innovative collaborative multi-agent system specifically designed for analyzing lung CT scans. LungNoduleAgent streamlines the diagnostic process into sequential components, improving precision in describing nodules and grading malignancy through three primary modules. The first module, the Nodule Spotter, coordinates clinical detection models to accurately identify nodules. The second module, the Radiologist, integrates localized image description techniques to produce comprehensive CT reports. Finally, the Doctor Agent System performs malignancy reasoning by using images and CT reports, supported by a pathology knowledge base and a multi-agent system framework. Extensive testing on two private datasets and the public LIDC-IDRI dataset indicates that LungNoduleAgent surpasses mainstream vision-language models, agent systems, and advanced expert models. These results highlight the importance of region-level semantic alignment and multi-agent collaboration in diagnosing nodules. LungNoduleAgent stands out as a promising foundational tool for supporting clinical analyses of lung nodules.

Abstract: Spatially varying image deblurring remains a fundamentally ill-posed problem, especially when degradations arise from complex mixtures of motion and other forms of blur under significant noise. State-of-the-art learning-based approaches generally fall into two paradigms: model-based deep unrolling methods that enforce physical constraints by modeling the degradations, but often produce over-smoothed, artifact-laden textures, and generative models that achieve superior perceptual quality yet hallucinate details due to weak physical constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that uniquely reconciles these paradigms by taming a powerful generative prior with explicit, dense physical constraints. Rather than oversimplifying the degradation field, we model it as a dense continuum of high-dimensional compressed kernels, ensuring that minute variations in motion and other degradation patterns are captured. We leverage this rich descriptor field to condition a ControlNet architecture, strongly guiding the diffusion sampling process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively bridges the gap between physical accuracy and perceptual realism, outperforming state-of-the-art model-based methods as well as generative baselines in challenging, severely blurred scenarios.

*Yingjie Xia,Xi Wang,Jinglei Shi,Vicky Kalogeiton,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUSE 是首个统一的图像情感合成框架，能够同时实现情感生成与编辑，通过类测试时扩展（TTS）策略，利用现成的情感分类器和梯度优化情感标记，在不依赖额外微调或专用数据集的情况下，解决了情感引导的稳定性、时机选择和多情感干扰问题。实验表明其在情感准确性、语义多样性和内容一致性方面均优于现有方法，推动了情感合成的新范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像情感合成（IES）方法将生成与编辑任务人为分离，导致效率低下且限制了在治疗干预、叙事等需要二者融合的应用场景中的使用。亟需一个统一框架来实现高效、自然的情感生成与编辑。

Method: MUSE 采用类测试时扩展（TTS）策略，通过梯度优化情感标记以稳定引导合成；利用语义相似性作为监督信号确定最优引导时机；设计多情感损失函数以减少固有及相似情绪之间的干扰。

Result: MUSE 在生成与编辑任务上均显著优于现有方法，提升了情感准确性与语义多样性，同时保持了对文本提示的遵循度和真实情感表达的一致性。

Conclusion: MUSE 建立了图像情感合成的新范式，实现了生成与编辑的统一，为情感驱动的视觉内容创作提供了高效、灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Images evoke emotions that profoundly influence perception, often prioritized over content. Current Image Emotional Synthesis (IES) approaches artificially separate generation and editing tasks, creating inefficiencies and limiting applications where these tasks naturally intertwine, such as therapeutic interventions or storytelling. In this work, we introduce MUSE, the first unified framework capable of both emotional generation and editing. By adopting a strategy conceptually aligned with Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that widely used in both LLM and diffusion model communities, it avoids the requirement for additional updating diffusion model and specialized emotional synthesis datasets. More specifically, MUSE addresses three key questions in emotional synthesis: (1) HOW to stably guide synthesis by leveraging an off-the-shelf emotion classifier with gradient-based optimization of emotional tokens; (2) WHEN to introduce emotional guidance by identifying the optimal timing using semantic similarity as a supervisory signal; and (3) WHICH emotion to guide synthesis through a multi-emotion loss that reduces interference from inherent and similar emotions. Experimental results show that MUSE performs favorably against all methods for both generation and editing, improving emotional accuracy and semantic diversity while maintaining an optimal balance between desired content, adherence to text prompts, and realistic emotional expression. It establishes a new paradigm for emotion synthesis.

Abstract: Image generation can provide physicians with an imaging diagnosis basis in the prediction of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Recent research has shown that long-term AD predictions by image generation often face difficulties maintaining disease-related characteristics when dealing with irregular time intervals in sequential data. Considering that the time-related aspects of the distribution can reflect changes in disease-related characteristics when images are distributed unevenly, this research proposes a model to estimate the temporal parameter within the Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution (T-NIG) to assist in generating images over the long term. The T-NIG model employs brain images from two different time points to create intermediate brain images, forecast future images, and predict the disease. T-NIG is designed by identifying features using coordinate neighborhoods. It incorporates a time parameter into the normal inverse gamma distribution to understand how features change in brain imaging sequences that have varying time intervals. Additionally, T-NIG utilizes uncertainty estimation to reduce both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in the model, which arise from insufficient temporal data. In particular, the T-NIG model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term prediction tasks within the dataset. Experimental results indicate that T-NIG is proficient in forecasting disease progression while maintaining disease-related characteristics, even when faced with an irregular temporal data distribution.

Abstract: Radar sensors provide reliable perception across adverse weather, lighting, and long-range conditions. Recent advances in foundation models have transformed visual and language understanding, yet their integration with radar sensing remains largely underexplored. Existing radar approaches are fragmented and task-specific; each downstream task employs distinct architectures and training objectives, preventing transfer across tasks. In this work, we introduce RadarFM: a radar foundation model that learns unified scene-level representations through structured spatial language supervision. We make two key contributions: (1) a structured caption framework that encodes vehicle distributions in native radar coordinates, and (2) a hash-aware contrastive learning objective that quantifies continuous scene similarity rather than binary matching, enabling fine-grained spatial reasoning. Leveraging the CARLA simulator, we generate large-scale, well-annotated radar datasets across diverse driving scenarios. We also propose localization-aware metrics that assess spatial accuracy beyond traditional detection measures.

Conclusion: EM-KD通过精准对齐与双策略蒸馏，有效克服了视觉标记不平衡问题，为高效多模态大模型的知识蒸馏提供了新范式。

Abstract: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) compress vision tokens to reduce resource consumption, but the loss of visual information can degrade comprehension capabilities. Although some priors introduce Knowledge Distillation to enhance student models, they overlook the fundamental differences in fine-grained vision comprehension caused by unbalanced vision tokens between the efficient student and vanilla teacher. In this paper, we propose EM-KD, a novel paradigm that enhances the Efficient MLLMs with Knowledge Distillation. To overcome the challenge of unbalanced vision tokens, we first calculate the Manhattan distance between the vision logits of teacher and student, and then align them in the spatial dimension with the Hungarian matching algorithm. After alignment, EM-KD introduces two distillation strategies: 1) Vision-Language Affinity Distillation (VLAD) and 2) Vision Semantic Distillation (VSD). Specifically, VLAD calculates the affinity matrix between text tokens and aligned vision tokens, and minimizes the smooth L1 distance of the student and the teacher affinity matrices. Considering the semantic richness of vision logits in the final layer, VSD employs the reverse KL divergence to measure the discrete probability distributions of the aligned vision logits over the vocabulary space. Comprehensive evaluation on diverse benchmarks demonstrates that EM-KD trained model outperforms prior Efficient MLLMs on both accuracy and efficiency with a large margin, validating its effectiveness. Compared with previous distillation methods, which are equipped with our proposed vision token matching strategy for fair comparison, EM-KD also achieves better performance.

Conclusion: FaithFusion成功实现了几何与外观的协同控制，具备良好的泛化性与可扩展性，无需额外结构修改或先验条件，为可控驾驶场景重建提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In controllable driving-scene reconstruction and 3D scene generation, maintaining geometric fidelity while synthesizing visually plausible appearance under large viewpoint shifts is crucial. However, effective fusion of geometry-based 3DGS and appearance-driven diffusion models faces inherent challenges, as the absence of pixel-wise, 3D-consistent editing criteria often leads to over-restoration and geometric drift. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{FaithFusion}, a 3DGS-diffusion fusion framework driven by pixel-wise Expected Information Gain (EIG). EIG acts as a unified policy for coherent spatio-temporal synthesis: it guides diffusion as a spatial prior to refine high-uncertainty regions, while its pixel-level weighting distills the edits back into 3DGS. The resulting plug-and-play system is free from extra prior conditions and structural modifications.Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our approach attains SOTA performance across NTA-IoU, NTL-IoU, and FID, maintaining an FID of 107.47 even at 6 meters lane shift.

Result: 在多个数据集上，AnchorOPT仅使用简单可学习锚点和位置矩阵，性能达到或超过包含额外可学习模块或正则化技术的方法，且作为通用模块能稳定提升现有框架表现。

Conclusion: AnchorOPT通过动态锚点和自适应位置优化，有效提升了提示学习的灵活性与性能，是一种高效、通用且易于集成的改进方案。

Abstract: Existing prompt learning methods, which are built upon CLIP models, leverage textual tokens as anchors to guide the learnable soft tokens. This guidance improves CLIP generalizations. However, these anchors-static in both value and position-lack cross-task and stage-adaptive flexibility. To address this limitation, we propose AnchorOPT, a dynamic anchor-based prompt learning framework. Specifically, AnchorOPT introduces dynamism in two key dimensions: (i) anchor values eschew handcrafted explicit textual tokens (e.g., "shape", "color"), instead learning dynamically from task-specific data; and (ii) the positional relationship between anchor and soft tokens is no longer fixed but adaptively optimized via a learnable position matrix conditioned on the training stage and task context. Training occurs in two stages: we first learn the anchor tokens, then freeze and transfer them to the second stage for optimization of soft tokens and the position matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that using only a simple learnable anchor and position matrix achieves performance comparable to or exceeding some methods incorporating additional learnable modules or regularization techniques. As a plug-and-play module, AnchorOPT integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks, yielding consistent performance gains across diverse datasets. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhengli97/ATPrompt.

Motivation: 现有大规模视觉生成模型在迁移至下游任务时存在参数冗余问题，传统剪枝方法难以兼顾生成多样性与条件保真度，且多采用静态剪枝策略，易导致性能下降或模式崩溃。因此亟需一种数据驱动、动态可调的剪枝机制。

Abstract: Large-scale vision generative models, including diffusion and flow models, have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, transferring these pre-trained models to downstream tasks often results in significant parameter redundancy. In this paper, we propose EntPruner, an entropy-guided automatic progressive pruning framework for diffusion and flow models. First, we introduce entropy-guided pruning, a block-level importance assessment strategy specifically designed for generative models. Unlike discriminative models, generative models require preserving the diversity and condition-fidelity of the output distribution. As the importance of each module can vary significantly across downstream tasks, EntPruner prioritizes pruning of less important blocks using data-dependent Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) as a guiding metric. CED quantifies how much the distribution diverges from the learned conditional data distribution after removing a block. Second, we propose a zero-shot adaptive pruning framework to automatically determine when and how much to prune during training. This dynamic strategy avoids the pitfalls of one-shot pruning, mitigating mode collapse, and preserving model performance. Extensive experiments on DiT and SiT models demonstrate the effectiveness of EntPruner, achieving up to 2.22$\times$ inference speedup while maintaining competitive generation quality on ImageNet and three downstream datasets.

Conclusion: 视觉干扰项对视觉语言模型的推理具有独特影响，其作用机制不同于文本干扰项，且可通过属性计数分析和针对性提示策略加以理解与改善。

Abstract: How does irrelevant information (i.e., distractors) affect test-time scaling in vision-language models (VLMs)? Prior studies on language models have reported an inverse scaling effect, where textual distractors lead to longer but less effective reasoning. To investigate whether similar phenomena occur in multimodal settings, we introduce Idis (Images with distractors), a visual question-answering dataset that systematically varies distractors along semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions. Our analyses reveal that visual distractors differ fundamentally from textual ones: although inverse scaling persists, adding visual distractors reduces accuracy without increasing reasoning length. We further show that tracking attribute counts within reasoning traces provides key insights into how distractors, reasoning length, and accuracy interact. Finally, we demonstrate that these trends extend to established visual bias benchmarks such as Waterbirds, and we propose a simple prompting strategy to mitigate bias-driven predictions in reasoning models.

Conclusion: 通过融合多种图形基础模态，结合统一的扩散建模与对齐数据集，CtrlVDiff实现了高效、鲁棒且可精确控制的视频生成与理解，为复杂视觉编辑提供了新范式。

Abstract: We tackle the dual challenges of video understanding and controllable video generation within a unified diffusion framework. Our key insights are two-fold: geometry-only cues (e.g., depth, edges) are insufficient: they specify layout but under-constrain appearance, materials, and illumination, limiting physically meaningful edits such as relighting or material swaps and often causing temporal drift. Enriching the model with additional graphics-based modalities (intrinsics and semantics) provides complementary constraints that both disambiguate understanding and enable precise, predictable control during generation.
  However, building a single model that uses many heterogeneous cues introduces two core difficulties. Architecturally, the model must accept any subset of modalities, remain robust to missing inputs, and inject control signals without sacrificing temporal consistency. Data-wise, training demands large-scale, temporally aligned supervision that ties real videos to per-pixel multimodal annotations.
  We then propose CtrlVDiff, a unified diffusion model trained with a Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS) that routes and fuses features from depth, normals, segmentation, edges, and graphics-based intrinsics (albedo, roughness, metallic), and re-renders videos from any chosen subset with strong temporal coherence. To enable this, we build MMVideo, a hybrid real-and-synthetic dataset aligned across modalities and captions. Across understanding and generation benchmarks, CtrlVDiff delivers superior controllability and fidelity, enabling layer-wise edits (relighting, material adjustment, object insertion) and surpassing state-of-the-art baselines while remaining robust when some modalities are unavailable.

Abstract: Human video generation has advanced rapidly with the development of diffusion models, but the high computational cost and substantial memory consumption associated with training these models on high-resolution, multi-frame data pose significant challenges. In this paper, we propose Entropy-Guided Prioritized Progressive Learning (Ent-Prog), an efficient training framework tailored for diffusion models on human video generation.

Ent-Prog reduces both training time and GPU memory consumption while maintaining model performance. Extensive experiments across three datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of Ent-Prog, achieving up to 2.2$\times$ training speedup and 2.4$\times$ GPU memory reduction without compromising generative performance.

Abstract: Text-to-Video (T2V) models are capable of synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent dynamic video content, but the diverse generation also inherently introduces critical safety challenges. Existing safety evaluation methods,which focus on static image and text generation, are insufficient to capture the complex temporal dynamics in video generation. To address this, we propose a TEmporal-aware Automated Red-teaming framework, named TEAR, an automated framework designed to uncover safety risks specifically linked to the dynamic temporal sequencing of T2V models. TEAR employs a temporal-aware test generator optimized via a two-stage approach: initial generator training and temporal-aware online preference learning, to craft textually innocuous prompts that exploit temporal dynamics to elicit policy-violating video output. And a refine model is adopted to improve the prompt stealthiness and adversarial effectiveness cyclically. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of TEAR across open-source and commercial T2V systems with over 80% attack success rate, a significant boost from prior best result of 57%.

Abstract: Visual encoding followed by token condensing has become the standard architectural paradigm in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Many recent MLLMs increasingly favor global native- resolution visual encoding over slice-based methods. To investigate this trend, we systematically compare their behavior on vision-language understanding and attention patterns, revealing that global encoding enhances overall capability but at the expense of greater computational overhead. To address this issue, we present LLaVA-UHD v3, an MLLM centered upon our proposed Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) method, which can be seamlessly integrated into standard Vision Transformer (ViT) to enable efficient native-resolution encoding. The PVC approach consists of two key modules: (i) refined patch embedding, which supports flexible patch-size scaling for fine-grained visual model- ing, (ii) windowed token compression, hierarchically deployed across ViT layers to progressively aggregate local token representations. Jointly modulated by these two modules, a widely pretrained ViT can be reconfigured into an efficient architecture while largely preserving generality. Evaluated across extensive benchmarks, the transformed ViT, termed ViT-UHD, demonstrates competitive performance with MoonViT while reducing TTFT (time-to-first-token) by 2.4x, when developed within an identical MLLM architecture. Building upon ViT-UHD, LLaVA-UHD v3 also achieves competitive performance to Qwen2-VL, while further reducing TTFT by 1.9x. We will release all code and checkpoints to support future research on efficient MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时扩展方法如 Best-of-N 在视觉自回归模型中效率低下，因全长度计算浪费于错误生成路径，且栅格扫描解码缺乏整体画布蓝图，导致可生成的提示对齐候选过少。

Method: 提出 GridAR 框架，采用网格分区的渐进生成机制，生成多个部分候选并早期剪枝无效路径，将可行候选固定为锚点引导后续解码；结合布局指定提示重构策略，基于局部视图推断合理布局以指导生成，弥补蓝图缺失问题。

Result: 在 T2I-CompBench++ 上，使用 N=4 的 GridAR 超越 Best-of-N（N=8）14.4%，同时减少 25.6% 计算成本；在 PIE-Bench 上，编辑质量相当，语义保留率提升 13.9%。

Conclusion: GridAR 有效提升了视觉自回归模型在有限测试时扩展下的生成质量与效率，具备良好的泛化能力，适用于文本到图像生成与自回归图像编辑任务。

Abstract: Recent visual autoregressive (AR) models have shown promising capabilities in text-to-image generation, operating in a manner similar to large language models. While test-time computation scaling has brought remarkable success in enabling reasoning-enhanced outputs for challenging natural language tasks, its adaptation to visual AR models remains unexplored and poses unique challenges. Naively applying test-time scaling strategies such as Best-of-N can be suboptimal: they consume full-length computation on erroneous generation trajectories, while the raster-scan decoding scheme lacks a blueprint of the entire canvas, limiting scaling benefits as only a few prompt-aligned candidates are generated. To address these, we introduce GridAR, a test-time scaling framework designed to elicit the best possible results from visual AR models. GridAR employs a grid-partitioned progressive generation scheme in which multiple partial candidates for the same position are generated within a canvas, infeasible ones are pruned early, and viable ones are fixed as anchors to guide subsequent decoding. Coupled with this, we present a layout-specified prompt reformulation strategy that inspects partial views to infer a feasible layout for satisfying the prompt. The reformulated prompt then guides subsequent image generation to mitigate the blueprint deficiency. Together, GridAR achieves higher-quality results under limited test-time scaling: with N=4, it even outperforms Best-of-N (N=8) by 14.4% on T2I-CompBench++ while reducing cost by 25.6%. It also generalizes to autoregressive image editing, showing comparable edit quality and a 13.9% gain in semantic preservation on PIE-Bench over larger-N baselines.

Conclusion: NDTokenizer3D 提供了一种紧凑且统一的 3D 视觉语言建模框架，成功融合语言推理与 3D 空间理解，为多任务 3D 场景理解与人机交互开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D vision-language models (VLMs) highlight a strong potential for 3D scene understanding and reasoning. However, effectively tokenizing 3D scenes into holistic scene tokens, and leveraging these tokens across diverse 3D understanding tasks, remain highly challenging. We present NDTokenizer3D, a generalist 3D VLM that performs a wide range of 3D scene understanding tasks while naturally supporting human interactions, thereby bridging language-level reasoning with 3D spatial understanding. The core of our approach is a novel three-stage scene tokenization pipeline built upon a Multi-Scale Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) representation, paired with a Multi-Scale NDT Decoder (MSDec). Specifically, NDTokenizer3D first constructs a multi-scale NDT representation from raw high-resolution point clouds, preserving both global context and fine-grained geometric details. Next, the MSDec progressively fuses cross-scale NDT features, producing holistic scene tokens consumable by LLM endpoints. Beyond tokenization, MSDec is repurposed as a general interface for human-interactive prompting (points, boxes, masks) and segmentation-mask decoding, unifying diverse 3D scene understanding tasks within a single architecture. With this compact and unified design, NDTokenizer3D offers a fine-grained, general-purpose 3D VLM, achieving remarkable improvements in 3D Referring Segmentation, 3D Visual Question Answering, and 3D Dense Captioning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为UPA-RFAS的统一框架，用于生成对视觉-语言-动作（VLA）驱动机器人具有普遍性和可迁移性的对抗性补丁。该方法在共享特征空间中学习单一物理补丁，通过特征空间目标、鲁棒性增强的两阶段极小极大过程以及两种VLA特定损失（注意力主导和语义错位），实现跨模型、跨任务和跨视角的攻击转移。实验表明，UPA-RFAS在多种VLA模型、操作任务和真实执行中均表现出强泛化能力，揭示了基于补丁的实用攻击面，并为未来防御研究提供了基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗性攻击多针对单一模型且难以在黑盒设置下迁移，缺乏对通用、可转移攻击的系统研究，尤其在未知架构、微调变体及仿真到现实的转换场景下。为此，亟需一种能有效攻击VLA机器人的通用且可迁移的对抗补丁方法。

Method: UPA-RFAS采用三重机制：(i) 特征空间目标结合ℓ₁偏差先验与排斥式InfoNCE损失，促进可迁移表示变化；(ii) 鲁棒性增强的两阶段极小极大优化流程，内层学习不可见的样本级扰动，外层优化通用补丁以对抗该强化邻域；(iii) 两种专为VLA设计的损失函数——Patch Attention Dominance（劫持文本到视觉注意力）与Patch Semantic Misalignment（诱导图像-文本不一致，无需标签）。

Result: UPA-RFAS在多种VLA模型、不同任务和视角下均展现出显著的跨模型、跨任务和跨视角攻击转移能力，成功在物理世界中执行并造成有效干扰，验证了其实际攻击潜力。实验结果揭示了一个广泛存在的补丁攻击面，同时为后续防御机制的研究提供了强有力基线。

Conclusion: 本研究系统揭示了视觉-语言-动作模型在面对物理对抗补丁时的脆弱性，提出了一种高效、通用且可迁移的攻击框架UPA-RFAS，不仅暴露了当前VLA系统的安全风险，也为构建更鲁棒的多模态智能系统提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, yet universal and transferable attacks remain underexplored, as most existing patches overfit to a single model and fail in black-box settings. To address this gap, we present a systematic study of universal, transferable adversarial patches against VLA-driven robots under unknown architectures, finetuned variants, and sim-to-real shifts. We introduce UPA-RFAS (Universal Patch Attack via Robust Feature, Attention, and Semantics), a unified framework that learns a single physical patch in a shared feature space while promoting cross-model transfer. UPA-RFAS combines (i) a feature-space objective with an $\ell_1$ deviation prior and repulsive InfoNCE loss to induce transferable representation shifts, (ii) a robustness-augmented two-phase min-max procedure where an inner loop learns invisible sample-wise perturbations and an outer loop optimizes the universal patch against this hardened neighborhood, and (iii) two VLA-specific losses: Patch Attention Dominance to hijack text$\to$vision attention and Patch Semantic Misalignment to induce image-text mismatch without labels. Experiments across diverse VLA models, manipulation suites, and physical executions show that UPA-RFAS consistently transfers across models, tasks, and viewpoints, exposing a practical patch-based attack surface and establishing a strong baseline for future defenses.

Motivation: 现有基础模型虽能学习跨模态通用表示，但在特定领域（如生态学）缺乏专业知识注入能力；且传统微调方法成本高、易引发灾难性遗忘。因此亟需一种轻量、高效且能保留原始模型能力的同时融入领域知识的适应方法。

Method: 提出BotaCLIP框架，利用高分辨率航空影像与植物样方数据进行多模态对比学习，引入正则化机制约束参数更新，防止对预训练知识的破坏，从而实现领域感知的模型适配。

Conclusion: BotaCLIP成功实现了对预训练基础模型的轻量化领域适配，通过对比学习与正则化策略有效注入生态学专业知识，为数据稀缺领域的高效表示学习提供了新范式。

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated a remarkable ability to learn rich, transferable representations across diverse modalities such as images, text, and audio. In modern machine learning pipelines, these representations often replace raw data as the primary input for downstream tasks. In this paper, we address the challenge of adapting a pre-trained foundation model to inject domain-specific knowledge, without retraining from scratch or incurring significant computational costs. To this end, we introduce BotaCLIP, a lightweight multimodal contrastive framework that adapts a pre-trained Earth Observation foundation model (DOFA) by aligning high-resolution aerial imagery with botanical relevés. Unlike generic embeddings, BotaCLIP internalizes ecological structure through contrastive learning with a regularization strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Once trained, the resulting embeddings serve as transferable representations for downstream predictors. Motivated by real-world applications in biodiversity modeling, we evaluated BotaCLIP representations in three ecological tasks: plant presence prediction, butterfly occurrence modeling, and soil trophic group abundance estimation. The results showed consistent improvements over those derived from DOFA and supervised baselines. More broadly, this work illustrates how domain-aware adaptation of foundation models can inject expert knowledge into data-scarce settings, enabling frugal representation learning.

TL;DR: 本文提出Action-Region Tracking (ART)框架，通过查询-响应机制追踪动作中细微局部区域的动态变化，以解决细粒度动作识别中难以捕捉时间演化局部细节的问题。核心方法包括：基于语义激活的区域检测模块，利用文本约束语义作为查询，定位每帧中最具动作相关性的区域；将区域响应组织为动作轨迹（tracklets），跨帧建模区域动态；引入多层级轨迹对比约束，增强空间与时间维度上的区分能力；并通过任务特定微调优化视觉语言模型提取的语义表示。在多个基准数据集上实验验证了该方法优于现有最先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前细粒度动作识别方法通常仅捕捉粗粒度运动模式，难以有效识别随时间演化的细微局部差异，导致相似动作间区分困难。因此需要一种能精准定位并追踪关键局部区域动态的新范式。

Method: 提出区域特定语义激活模块，使用由视觉语言模型生成的文本约束语义作为查询，从视频帧中提取最具动作相关性的局部区域响应；将这些响应连接成跨帧一致的动作轨迹（tracklets）；设计多层级轨迹对比损失，在空间和时间层面强化区分性；采用任务特定微调策略优化语义表示，保持预训练语义的同时适配具体任务需求。

Result: 在多个主流细粒度动作识别数据集上，ART框架显著优于现有最先进方法，证明其在捕捉局部动态、提升类别区分能力方面的有效性。

Conclusion: ART框架通过引入查询-响应机制与轨迹建模，成功实现了对细粒度动作中细微局部动态的精准追踪，为解决相似动作间的判别难题提供了新思路，并在多个基准上取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Fine-grained action recognition (FGAR) aims to identify subtle and distinctive differences among fine-grained action categories. However, current recognition methods often capture coarse-grained motion patterns but struggle to identify subtle details in local regions evolving over time. In this work, we introduce the Action-Region Tracking (ART) framework, a novel solution leveraging a query-response mechanism to discover and track the dynamics of distinctive local details, enabling effective distinction of similar actions. Specifically, we propose a region-specific semantic activation module that employs discriminative and text-constrained semantics as queries to capture the most action-related region responses in each video frame, facilitating interaction among spatial and temporal dimensions with corresponding video features. The captured region responses are organized into action tracklets, which characterize region-based action dynamics by linking related responses across video frames in a coherent sequence. The text-constrained queries encode nuanced semantic representations derived from textual descriptions of action labels extracted by language branches within Visual Language Models (VLMs). To optimize the action tracklets, we design a multi-level tracklet contrastive constraint among region responses at spatial and temporal levels, enabling effective discrimination within each frame and correlation between adjacent frames. Additionally, a task-specific fine-tuning mechanism refines textual semantics such that semantic representations encoded by VLMs are preserved while optimized for task preferences. Comprehensive experiments on widely used action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the superiority to previous state-of-the-art baselines.

*Umang Agarwal,Rudraksh Sangore,Sumit Laddha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文对比了三种生成模型范式：DDPM、CFM和MeanFlow。CFM在50步采样下FID达24.15，显著优于DDPM的402.98；MeanFlow实现单步生成，FID为29.15，推理时间减少50倍。研究还扩展CFM至图像修复任务，通过掩码引导采样，在多种掩码类型上显著提升PSNR与SSIM，验证了修复感知训练的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型如DDPM和CFM依赖迭代采样，效率较低；而直接生成方法如MeanFlow虽快但性能受限。本文旨在比较不同范式性能与效率，并探索更高效且高质量的生成与修复方法。

Method: 采用统一的TinyUNet架构（<1.5M参数）在CIFAR-10上实现DDPM、CFM和MeanFlow；CFM通过条件流匹配建模概率流；MeanFlow直接建模平均速度以实现单步生成；图像修复任务中引入四种掩码类型（中心、随机边界框、不规则、半幅），并进行掩码引导采样与修复感知微调。

Result: CFM在50步采样下取得FID 24.15，远超DDPM的402.98；MeanFlow实现单步生成，FID为29.15，推理时间降低50倍；图像修复任务中PSNR从4.95提升至8.57 dB（+73%），SSIM从0.289提升至0.418（+45%）。

Conclusion: CFM在生成质量与效率之间取得良好平衡，而MeanFlow实现了极高的推理效率。结合掩码引导与修复感知训练，可显著提升图像修复性能，表明条件流匹配框架在多任务生成中的强大潜力。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparative study of three generative modeling paradigms: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), and MeanFlow. While DDPM and CFM require iterative sampling, MeanFlow enables direct one-step generation by modeling the average velocity over time intervals. We implement all three methods using a unified TinyUNet architecture (<1.5M parameters) on CIFAR-10, demonstrating that CFM achieves an FID of 24.15 with 50 steps, significantly outperforming DDPM (FID 402.98). MeanFlow achieves FID 29.15 with single-step sampling -- a 50X reduction in inference time. We further extend CFM to image inpainting, implementing mask-guided sampling with four mask types (center, random bbox, irregular, half). Our fine-tuned inpainting model achieves substantial improvements: PSNR increases from 4.95 to 8.57 dB on center masks (+73%), and SSIM improves from 0.289 to 0.418 (+45%), demonstrating the effectiveness of inpainting-aware training.

Abstract: Facial expressions convey the bulk of emotional information in human communication, yet existing 3D face reconstruction methods often miss subtle affective details due to reliance on 2D supervision and lack of 3D ground truth. We propose FIELDS (Face reconstruction with accurate Inference of Expression using Learning with Direct Supervision) to address these limitations by extending self-supervised 2D image consistency cues with direct 3D expression parameter supervision and an auxiliary emotion recognition branch. Our encoder is guided by authentic expression parameters from spontaneous 4D facial scans, while an intensity-aware emotion loss encourages the 3D expression parameters to capture genuine emotion content without exaggeration. This dual-supervision strategy bridges the 2D/3D domain gap and mitigates expression-intensity bias, yielding high-fidelity 3D reconstructions that preserve subtle emotional cues. From a single image, FIELDS produces emotion-rich face models with highly realistic expressions, significantly improving in-the-wild facial expression recognition performance without sacrificing naturalness.

Abstract: The threat of Audio-Video (AV) forgery is rapidly evolving beyond human-centric deepfakes to include more diverse manipulations across complex natural scenes. However, existing benchmarks are still confined to DeepFake-based forgeries and single-granularity annotations, thus failing to capture the diversity and complexity of real-world forgery scenarios. To address this, we introduce AVFakeBench, the first comprehensive audio-video forgery detection benchmark that spans rich forgery semantics across both human subject and general subject. AVFakeBench comprises 12K carefully curated audio-video questions, covering seven forgery types and four levels of annotations. To ensure high-quality and diverse forgeries, we propose a multi-stage hybrid forgery framework that integrates proprietary models for task planning with expert generative models for precise manipulation. The benchmark establishes a multi-task evaluation framework covering binary judgment, forgery types classification, forgery detail selection, and explanatory reasoning. We evaluate 11 Audio-Video Large Language Models (AV-LMMs) and 2 prevalent detection methods on AVFakeBench, demonstrating the potential of AV-LMMs as emerging forgery detectors while revealing their notable weaknesses in fine-grained perception and reasoning.

Motivation: 现有LiDAR生成方法仅支持单帧生成，而预测方法需多帧历史输入且为确定性一次性输出，二者均无法实现长时程交互式生成。因此亟需一种可逐帧生成、支持长期互动的新型框架。

Method: 提出LaGen框架，采用自回归机制逐帧生成4D点云；引入场景解耦估计模块以增强对象级内容的交互生成能力；设计噪声调制模块以缓解长时间生成中的误差累积问题。

Conclusion: LaGen首次实现了基于单帧输入的长时程、交互式LiDAR场景生成，具备高保真度与强鲁棒性，为自动驾驶中的生成式世界建模提供了新范式。

Abstract: Generative world models for autonomous driving (AD) have become a trending topic. Unlike the widely studied image modality, in this work we explore generative world models for LiDAR data. Existing generation methods for LiDAR data only support single frame generation, while existing prediction approaches require multiple frames of historical input and can only deterministically predict multiple frames at once, lacking interactivity. Both paradigms fail to support long-horizon interactive generation. To this end, we introduce LaGen, which to the best of our knowledge is the first framework capable of frame-by-frame autoregressive generation of long-horizon LiDAR scenes. LaGen is able to take a single-frame LiDAR input as a starting point and effectively utilize bounding box information as conditions to generate high-fidelity 4D scene point clouds. In addition, we introduce a scene decoupling estimation module to enhance the model's interactive generation capability for object-level content, as well as a noise modulation module to mitigate error accumulation during long-horizon generation. We construct a protocol based on nuScenes for evaluating long-horizon LiDAR scene generation. Experimental results comprehensively demonstrate LaGen outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR generation and prediction models, especially on the later frames.

TL;DR: MatchGS 是首个系统性修正并利用 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) 进行鲁棒零样本图像匹配的框架。通过几何精确的数据生成管道和 2D-3D 表示对齐策略，显著提升对应点标注精度，减少视点变化下的误差，实现高达 17.7% 的零样本性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习型图像匹配依赖大规模、多样且几何准确的数据，但 3DGS 存在几何不准确和深度渲染偏差问题，难以生成可靠对应标签。因此需要一种方法来修正 3DGS 的缺陷，以支持高质量数据生成和匹配器训练。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：(1) 几何忠实的数据生成流程，优化 3DGS 几何结构以生成高精度对应标签；(2) 2D-3D 表示对齐机制，将 3DGS 的显式 3D 知识注入 2D 匹配器，使其学习视角不变的 3D 表示。

Result: 生成的真值对应关系使对极误差降低达 40 倍；支持极端视角变化下的监督学习；提供基于高斯属性的自监督信号；基于该数据训练的先进匹配器在公开基准上实现最高 17.7% 的零样本性能提升。

Conclusion: 经过适当几何修正后，3DGS 可作为可扩展、高保真且结构丰富的数据源，推动新一代鲁棒零样本图像匹配器的发展。

Abstract: Learning-based image matching critically depends on large-scale, diverse, and geometrically accurate training data. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables photorealistic novel-view synthesis and thus is attractive for data generation. However, its geometric inaccuracies and biased depth rendering currently prevent robust correspondence labeling. To address this, we introduce MatchGS, the first framework designed to systematically correct and leverage 3DGS for robust, zero-shot image matching. Our approach is twofold: (1) a geometrically-faithful data generation pipeline that refines 3DGS geometry to produce highly precise correspondence labels, enabling the synthesis of a vast and diverse range of viewpoints without compromising rendering fidelity; and (2) a 2D-3D representation alignment strategy that infuses 3DGS' explicit 3D knowledge into the 2D matcher, guiding 2D semi-dense matchers to learn viewpoint-invariant 3D representations. Our generated ground-truth correspondences reduce the epipolar error by up to 40 times compared to existing datasets, enable supervision under extreme viewpoint changes, and provide self-supervisory signals through Gaussian attributes. Consequently, state-of-the-art matchers trained solely on our data achieve significant zero-shot performance gains on public benchmarks, with improvements of up to 17.7%. Our work demonstrates that with proper geometric refinement, 3DGS can serve as a scalable, high-fidelity, and structurally-rich data source, paving the way for a new generation of robust zero-shot image matchers.

Abstract: With Transformers achieving outstanding performance on individual remote sensing (RS) tasks, we are now approaching the realization of a unified model that excels across multiple tasks through multi-task learning (MTL). Compared to single-task approaches, MTL methods offer improved generalization, enhanced scalability, and greater practical applicability. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have achieved promising results in RS image understanding, grounding, and ultra-high-resolution (UHR) image reasoning, respectively. Moreover, the unified text-based interface demonstrates significant potential for MTL. Hence, in this work, we present RSCoVLM, a simple yet flexible VLM baseline for RS MTL. Firstly, we create the data curation engine, including data acquisition, offline processing and integrating, as well as online loading and weighting. This data engine effectively addresses complex RS data enviroment and generates flexible vision-language conversations. Furthermore, we propose a unified dynamic-resolution strategy to address the diverse image scales inherent in RS imagery. For UHR images, we introduce the Zoom-in Chain mechanism together with its corresponding dataset, LRS-VQA-Zoom. The strategies are flexible and effectively mitigate the computational burdens. Additionally, we significantly enhance the model's object detection capability and propose a novel evaluation protocol that ensures fair comparison between VLMs and conventional detection models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSCoVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, outperforming existing RS VLMs and even rivaling specialized expert models. All the training and evaluating tools, model weights, and datasets have been fully open-sourced to support reproducibility. We expect that this baseline will promote further progress toward general-purpose RS models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为头级时间合并（HTTM）的训练无关的3D令牌合并方法，用于加速视觉几何基础变压器（VGGT）模型。该方法通过在多头粒度上合并令牌，保留了特征令牌的独特性，并利用头级别上的空间局部性和时间对应关系，实现更高的合并比率和更低的合并成本，从而在保持性能几乎不变的前提下，实现高达7倍的加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VGGT虽然实现了3D场景重建中相机位姿、深度和密集几何信息的联合推断，但其全局注意力机制在处理长序列输入的大场景时导致显著延迟瓶颈。因此需要一种高效且不依赖训练的令牌合并方法来提升推理速度。

Method: 提出头级时间合并（HTTM），在多头注意力机制中按头粒度进行令牌合并，利用头级别的空间局部性和时间对应性优化合并策略，避免传统均匀合并带来的特征冗余问题。

Result: HTTM在不明显降低模型性能的前提下，实现了最高达7倍的推理加速，在基于GPU的推理中表现优异。

Conclusion: HTTM是一种高效的训练无关的3D令牌合并方法，能够有效缓解大场景下VGGT的推理延迟问题，同时保持模型的表达能力与精度，为大规模3D场景重建提供了实用的加速方案。

Abstract: The Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) marks a significant leap forward in 3D scene reconstruction, as it is the first model that directly infers all key 3D attributes (camera poses, depths, and dense geometry) jointly in one pass. However, this joint inference mechanism requires global attention layers that perform all-to-all attention computation on tokens from all views. For reconstruction of large scenes with long-sequence inputs, this causes a significant latency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose head-wise temporal merging (HTTM), a training-free 3D token merging method for accelerating VGGT. Existing merging techniques merge tokens uniformly across different attention heads, resulting in identical tokens in the layers' output, which hinders the model's representational ability. HTTM tackles this problem by merging tokens in multi-head granularity, which preserves the uniqueness of feature tokens after head concatenation. Additionally, this enables HTTM to leverage the spatial locality and temporal correspondence observed at the head level to achieve higher merging ratios with lower merging costs compared to existing methods. Thus, HTTM achieves up to 7x acceleration with negligible performance drops in a GPU-based inference.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have highlighted their potential for medical and surgical applications. However, existing surgical datasets predominantly adopt a Visual Question Answering (VQA) format with heterogeneous taxonomies and lack support for pixel-level segmentation, limiting consistent evaluation and applicability. We present SurgMLLMBench, a unified multimodal benchmark explicitly designed for developing and evaluating interactive multimodal LLMs for surgical scene understanding, including the newly collected Micro-surgical Artificial Vascular anastomosIS (MAVIS) dataset. It integrates pixel-level instrument segmentation masks and structured VQA annotations across laparoscopic, robot-assisted, and micro-surgical domains under a unified taxonomy, enabling comprehensive evaluation beyond traditional VQA tasks and richer visual-conversational interactions. Extensive baseline experiments show that a single model trained on SurgMLLMBench achieves consistent performance across domains and generalizes effectively to unseen datasets. SurgMLLMBench will be publicly released as a robust resource to advance multimodal surgical AI research, supporting reproducible evaluation and development of interactive surgical reasoning models.

Conclusion: 所提方法通过多尺度特征聚合与补偿机制，实现了对局部几何结构的自适应建模，有效解决了邻域尺寸选择难题，提升了点云法向估计的鲁棒性与效率。

Abstract: Estimating the normal of a point requires constructing a local patch to provide center-surrounding context, but determining the appropriate neighborhood size is difficult when dealing with different data or geometries. Existing methods commonly employ various parameter-heavy strategies to extract a full feature description from the input patch. However, they still have difficulties in accurately and efficiently predicting normals for various point clouds. In this work, we present a new idea of feature extraction for robust normal estimation of point clouds. We use the fusion of multi-scale features from different neighborhood sizes to address the issue of selecting reasonable patch sizes for various data or geometries. We seek to model a patch feature fitting (PFF) based on multi-scale features to approximate the optimal geometric description for normal estimation and implement the approximation process via multi-scale feature aggregation and cross-scale feature compensation. The feature aggregation module progressively aggregates the patch features of different scales to the center of the patch and shrinks the patch size by removing points far from the center. It not only enables the network to precisely capture the structure characteristic in a wide range, but also describes highly detailed geometries. The feature compensation module ensures the reusability of features from earlier layers of large scales and reveals associated information in different patch sizes. Our approximation strategy based on aggregating the features of multiple scales enables the model to achieve scale adaptation of varying local patches and deliver the optimal feature description. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets with fewer network parameters and running time.

TL;DR: Endo-G$^{2}$T提出一种几何引导且时序感知的训练方案，用于动态内窥镜视频的4D高斯溅射重建。通过渐进式先验蒸馏、时空嵌入的高斯场建模和关键帧约束流优化，实现早期几何锚定、时序一致性与高效性，显著提升单目重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜视频存在强视角依赖效应（如镜面反射、湿反射、遮挡），纯光度监督易导致几何漂移，需在早期锚定几何结构以保持动态场景中重建的准确性与稳定性。

Method: 1. 几何引导先验蒸馏：将置信度门控的单目深度转换为尺度不变深度与深度梯度损失，采用从暖启动到饱和的调度策略软注入先验，避免过拟合；2. 时空嵌入高斯场：采用旋转变量参数化表示XYZT中的动态变化，实现平滑运动与清晰不透明边界；3. 关键帧约束流优化：在最大点数预算下，仅对关键帧进行密集优化，非关键帧轻量更新，提升效率与长时稳定性能。

Conclusion: Endo-G$^{2}$T成功实现了动态内窥镜视频中早期几何锚定与高效时序建模，为复杂视图依赖场景下的4D重建提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Endoscopic (endo) video exhibits strong view-dependent effects such as specularities, wet reflections, and occlusions. Pure photometric supervision misaligns with geometry and triggers early geometric drift, where erroneous shapes are reinforced during densification and become hard to correct. We ask how to anchor geometry early for 4D Gaussian splatting (4DGS) while maintaining temporal consistency and efficiency in dynamic endoscopic scenes. Thus, we present Endo-G$^{2}$T, a geometry-guided and temporally aware training scheme for time-embedded 4DGS. First, geo-guided prior distillation converts confidence-gated monocular depth into supervision with scale-invariant depth and depth-gradient losses, using a warm-up-to-cap schedule to inject priors softly and avoid early overfitting. Second, a time-embedded Gaussian field represents dynamics in XYZT with a rotor-like rotation parameterization, yielding temporally coherent geometry with lightweight regularization that favors smooth motion and crisp opacity boundaries. Third, keyframe-constrained streaming improves efficiency and long-horizon stability through keyframe-focused optimization under a max-points budget, while non-keyframes advance with lightweight updates. Across EndoNeRF and StereoMIS-P1 datasets, Endo-G$^{2}$T achieves state-of-the-art results among monocular reconstruction baselines.

TL;DR: STVG-o1 enables off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve state-of-the-art spatio-temporal video grounding performance through a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism and multi-dimensional reinforcement learning, showing superior accuracy and generalization across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) underperform on spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) due to misaligned training objectives and weak fine-grained region-word alignment in standard visual encoders.

Method: Proposes STVG-o1, a framework that enables off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve state-of-the-art STVG performance without architectural changes. It introduces a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism for explicit spatio-temporal reasoning and a multi-dimensional reinforcement reward function with format, consistency, temporal, spatial, and think rewards for geometry-aware supervision via reinforcement fine-tuning.

Result: STVG-o1 achieves new state-of-the-art results on HCSTVG-v1/v2 and VidSTG, outperforming the best task-specific method by 7.3% m_tIoU on HCSTVG-v1, matches specialized models on VidSTG, and surpasses all existing MLLM-based approaches. It also shows strong open-vocabulary generalization across datasets.

Conclusion: MLLMs can serve as viable and powerful backbones for precise spatio-temporal grounding when equipped with STVG-o1, demonstrating significant potential for future applications.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) requires localizing a target object in untrimmed videos both temporally and spatially from natural language descriptions. Despite their strong language understanding, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) underperform on STVG due to misaligned training objectives and weak fine-grained region-word alignment in standard visual encoders. To address this, we propose STVG-o1, the first framework that enables off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve state-of-the-art STVG performance without any architectural modifications. Our method introduces a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism that explicitly reasons about spatio-temporal locations in an intermediate step before producing the final prediction. We further design a multi-dimensional reinforcement reward function consisting of format, consistency, temporal, spatial, and think rewards, which provides geometry-aware supervision through reinforcement fine-tuning. Evaluated on HCSTVG-v1/v2 and VidSTG, STVG-o1 sets new state-of-the-art results on HCSTVG, outperforming the best task-specific method by 7.3\% m\_tIoU on HCSTVG-v1, matching specialized models on VidSTG, and surpassing all existing MLLM-based approaches by large margins. It also demonstrates strong open-vocabulary generalization across datasets, establishing MLLMs as viable and powerful backbones for precise spatio-temporal grounding. Our code and models will be released.

Abstract: "Thinking with images" has emerged as an effective paradigm for advancing visual reasoning, extending beyond text-only chains of thought by injecting visual evidence into intermediate reasoning steps. However, existing methods fall short of human-like abstract visual thinking, as their flexibility is fundamentally limited by external tools. In this work, we introduce Monet, a training framework that enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to reason directly within the latent visual space by generating continuous embeddings that function as intermediate visual thoughts. We identify two core challenges in training MLLMs for latent visual reasoning: high computational cost in latent-vision alignment and insufficient supervision over latent embeddings, and address them with a three-stage distillation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline. We further reveal a limitation of applying GRPO to latent reasoning: it primarily enhances text-based reasoning rather than latent reasoning. To overcome this, we propose VLPO (Visual-latent Policy Optimization), a reinforcement learning method that explicitly incorporates latent embeddings into policy gradient updates. To support SFT, we construct Monet-SFT-125K, a high-quality text-image interleaved CoT dataset containing 125K real-world, chart, OCR, and geometry CoTs. Our model, Monet-7B, shows consistent gains across real-world perception and reasoning benchmarks and exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization on challenging abstract visual reasoning tasks. We also empirically analyze the role of each training component and discuss our early unsuccessful attempts, providing insights for future developments in visual latent reasoning.

TL;DR: DiverseVAR 提出一种无需重训练或大量计算开销的测试时多样性增强框架，通过在文本嵌入中注入噪声并结合多尺度潜变量重构技术（scale-travel），有效提升视觉自回归模型的生成多样性，同时最小化图像质量下降，实现多样性与质量的新权衡前沿。

Motivation: 当前视觉自回归模型（VAR）虽在图像生成质量上表现优异，但存在生成多样性不足的问题，即对简单提示生成高度相似的图像，这一缺陷长期被忽视。为提升生成多样性，需在不牺牲图像质量的前提下进行改进。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：1）在测试时向文本嵌入注入噪声以增强多样性；2）引入 scale-travel 技术，利用多尺度自动编码器提取粗粒度潜变量，实现中间阶段的生成恢复，从而缓解因噪声注入导致的质量下降。

Result: 实验表明，结合文本嵌入噪声注入与 scale-travel 优化后，模型在多样性上显著提升，且图像质量损失极小，实现了多样性与质量之间的新帕累托最优。

Conclusion: DiverseVAR 有效解决了视觉自回归模型在生成多样性方面的瓶颈，提供了一种轻量级、高效的测试时增强方案，为未来高质量、高多样性的图像生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce DiverseVAR, a framework that enhances the diversity of text-conditioned visual autoregressive models (VAR) at test time without requiring retraining, fine-tuning, or substantial computational overhead. While VAR models have recently emerged as strong competitors to diffusion and flow models for image generation, they suffer from a critical limitation in diversity, often producing nearly identical images even for simple prompts. This issue has largely gone unnoticed amid the predominant focus on image quality. We address this limitation at test time in two stages. First, inspired by diversity enhancement techniques in diffusion models, we propose injecting noise into the text embedding. This introduces a trade-off between diversity and image quality: as diversity increases, the image quality sharply declines. To preserve quality, we propose scale-travel: a novel latent refinement technique inspired by time-travel strategies in diffusion models. Specifically, we use a multi-scale autoencoder to extract coarse-scale tokens that enable us to resume generation at intermediate stages. Extensive experiments show that combining text-embedding noise injection with our scale-travel refinement significantly enhances diversity while minimizing image-quality degradation, achieving a new Pareto frontier in the diversity-quality trade-off.

Abstract: Remote sensing change captioning is an emerging and popular research task that aims to describe, in natural language, the content of interest that has changed between two remote sensing images captured at different times. Existing methods typically employ CNNs/Transformers to extract visual representations from the given images or incorporate auxiliary tasks to enhance the final results, with weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of the SAM (Segment Anything Model) foundation model to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge into the captioning framework. Specifically, we employ a CNN/Transformer model to extract global-level vision features, leverage the SAM foundation model to delineate semantic- and motion-level change regions, and utilize a specially constructed knowledge graph to provide information about objects of interest. These heterogeneous sources of information are then fused via cross-attention, and a Transformer decoder is used to generate the final natural language description of the observed changes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple widely used benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: E-M3RF通过融合几何与颜色信息并引入等变结构和物理合理性约束，在复杂破碎场景下实现了更精确、鲁棒的3D重装效果。

Abstract: 3D reassembly is a fundamental geometric problem, and in recent years it has increasingly been challenged by deep learning methods rather than classical optimization. While learning approaches have shown promising results, most still rely primarily on geometric features to assemble a whole from its parts. As a result, methods struggle when geometry alone is insufficient or ambiguous, for example, for small, eroded, or symmetric fragments. Additionally, solutions do not impose physical constraints that explicitly prevent overlapping assemblies. To address these limitations, we introduce E-M3RF, an equivariant multimodal 3D reassembly framework that takes as input the point clouds, containing both point positions and colors of fractured fragments, and predicts the transformations required to reassemble them using SE(3) flow matching. Each fragment is represented by both geometric and color features: i) 3D point positions are encoded as rotationconsistent geometric features using a rotation-equivariant encoder, ii) the colors at each 3D point are encoded with a transformer. The two feature sets are then combined to form a multimodal representation. We experimented on four datasets: two synthetic datasets, Breaking Bad and Fantastic Breaks, and two real-world cultural heritage datasets, RePAIR and Presious, demonstrating that E-M3RF on the RePAIR dataset reduces rotation error by 23.1% and translation error by 13.2%, while Chamfer Distance decreases by 18.4% compared to competing methods.

Abstract: We present a novel unsupervised framework to unlock vast unlabeled human demonstration data from continuous industrial video streams for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model pre-training. Our method first trains a lightweight motion tokenizer to encode motion dynamics, then employs an unsupervised action segmenter leveraging a novel "Latent Action Energy" metric to discover and segment semantically coherent action primitives. The pipeline outputs both segmented video clips and their corresponding latent action sequences, providing structured data directly suitable for VLA pre-training. Evaluations on public benchmarks and a proprietary electric motor assembly dataset demonstrate effective segmentation of key tasks performed by humans at workstations. Further clustering and quantitative assessment via a Vision-Language Model confirm the semantic coherence of the discovered action primitives. To our knowledge, this is the first fully automated end-to-end system for extracting and organizing VLA pre-training data from unstructured industrial videos, offering a scalable solution for embodied AI integration in manufacturing.

Abstract: Event cameras produce asynchronous event streams that are spatially sparse yet temporally dense. Mainstream event representation learning algorithms typically use event frames, voxels, or tensors as input. Although these approaches have achieved notable progress, they struggle to address the undersampling problem caused by spatial sparsity. In this paper, we propose a novel hypergraph-guided spatio-temporal event stream completion mechanism, which connects event tokens across different times and spatial locations via hypergraphs and leverages contextual information message passing to complete these sparse events. The proposed method can flexibly incorporate RGB tokens as nodes in the hypergraph within this completion framework, enabling multi-modal hypergraph-based information completion. Subsequently, we aggregate hypergraph node information across different time steps through self-attention, enabling effective learning and fusion of multi-modal features. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-label event classification tasks fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

Abstract: Recently, video generation has witnessed rapid advancements, drawing increasing attention to image-to-video (I2V) synthesis on mobile devices. However, the substantial computational complexity and slow generation speed of diffusion models pose significant challenges for real-time, high-resolution video generation on resource-constrained mobile devices. In this work, we propose MobileI2V, a 270M lightweight diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation on mobile devices. The core lies in: (1) We analyzed the performance of linear attention modules and softmax attention modules on mobile devices, and proposed a linear hybrid architecture denoiser that balances generation efficiency and quality. (2) We design a time-step distillation strategy that compresses the I2V sampling steps from more than 20 to only two without significant quality loss, resulting in a 10-fold increase in generation speed. (3) We apply mobile-specific attention optimizations that yield a 2-fold speed-up for attention operations during on-device inference. MobileI2V enables, for the first time, fast 720p image-to-video generation on mobile devices, with quality comparable to existing models. Under one-step conditions, the generation speed of each frame of 720p video is less than 100 ms. Our code is available at: https://github.com/hustvl/MobileI2V.

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated exceptional performance across various computer vision tasks, yet their quadratic computational complexity concerning token length remains a significant challenge. To address this, token reduction methods have been widely explored. However, existing approaches often overlook the frequency characteristics of self-attention, such as rank collapsing and over-smoothing phenomenon. In this paper, we propose a frequency-aware token reduction strategy that improves computational efficiency while preserving performance by mitigating rank collapsing. Our method partitions tokens into high-frequency tokens and low-frequency tokens. high-frequency tokens are selectively preserved, while low-frequency tokens are aggregated into a compact direct current token to retain essential low-frequency components. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves accuracy while reducing computational overhead and mitigating rank collapsing and over smoothing. Furthermore, we analyze the previous methods, shedding light on their implicit frequency characteristics and limitations.

Conclusion: M&B是一种高效、通用且无需修改架构的类别增量学习方法，通过权重合并与有界更新策略，实现了对新旧任务知识的有效平衡，为CIL提供了新的优化思路。

Abstract: We present a novel training approach, named Merge-and-Bound (M&B) for Class Incremental Learning (CIL), which directly manipulates model weights in the parameter space for optimization. Our algorithm involves two types of weight merging: inter-task weight merging and intra-task weight merging. Inter-task weight merging unifies previous models by averaging the weights of models from all previous stages. On the other hand, intra-task weight merging facilitates the learning of current task by combining the model parameters within current stage. For reliable weight merging, we also propose a bounded update technique that aims to optimize the target model with minimal cumulative updates and preserve knowledge from previous tasks; this strategy reveals that it is possible to effectively obtain new models near old ones, reducing catastrophic forgetting. M&B is seamlessly integrated into existing CIL methods without modifying architecture components or revising learning objectives. We extensively evaluate our algorithm on standard CIL benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Method: 采用交叉注意力机制，使学生特征图中的每个像素能动态关注教师特征图的所有像素，实现非局部知识转移，并引入额外损失函数以优化特征对齐。

Result: 在目标检测和图像分割任务上，CanKD显著优于现有的特征蒸馏和混合蒸馏方法，在多个基准数据集上取得更高精度，证明了其有效性与泛化能力。

Conclusion: CanKD是一种高效且有效的注意力引导知识蒸馏新方法，通过跨特征图的非局部交互显著提升特征表示质量，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: We propose Cross-Attention-based Non-local Knowledge Distillation (CanKD), a novel feature-based knowledge distillation framework that leverages cross-attention mechanisms to enhance the knowledge transfer process. Unlike traditional self-attention-based distillation methods that align teacher and student feature maps independently, CanKD enables each pixel in the student feature map to dynamically consider all pixels in the teacher feature map. This non-local knowledge transfer more thoroughly captures pixel-wise relationships, improving feature representation learning. Our method introduces only an additional loss function to achieve superior performance compared with existing attention-guided distillation methods. Extensive experiments on object detection and image segmentation tasks demonstrate that CanKD outperforms state-of-the-art feature and hybrid distillation methods. These experimental results highlight CanKD's potential as a new paradigm for attention-guided distillation in computer vision tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/tori-hotaru/CanKD

To address this, we systematically investigate how different design choices influence the accuracy and generalization capabilities of deepfake detection models, focusing on aspects related to training, inference, and incremental updates. By isolating the impact of individual factors, we aim to establish robust, architecture-agnostic best practices for the design and development of future deepfake detection systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ANA检测依赖人工，耗时耗力且需长期培训；面对超过100种共存抗体导致的复杂荧光模式组合，现有机器学习方法难以应对真实临床场景下的多实例多标签学习挑战。因此亟需一种无需预处理、能端到端优化的自动化检测框架。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架有效克服了传统MIML方法的局限性，实现了无需预处理的端到端自动化ANA检测，在真实临床环境中具备高度可行性与先进性，为自身免疫病诊断提供了强有力的技术支持。

Abstract: Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing is a crucial method for diagnosing autoimmune disorders, including lupus, Sjögren's syndrome, and scleroderma. Despite its importance, manual ANA detection is slow, labor-intensive, and demands years of training. ANA detection is complicated by over 100 coexisting antibody types, resulting in vast fluorescent pattern combinations. Although machine learning and deep learning have enabled automation, ANA detection in real-world clinical settings presents unique challenges as it involves multi-instance, multi-label (MIML) learning. In this paper, a novel framework for ANA detection is proposed that handles the complexities of MIML tasks using unaltered microscope images without manual preprocessing. Inspired by human labeling logic, it identifies consistent ANA sub-regions and assigns aggregated labels accordingly. These steps are implemented using three task-specific components: an instance sampler, a probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher, and self-paced weight learning rate coefficients. The instance sampler suppresses low-confidence instances by modeling pattern confidence, while the dispatcher adaptively assigns labels based on instance distinguishability. Self-paced learning adjusts training according to empirical label observations. Our framework overcomes limitations of traditional MIML methods and supports end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on one ANA dataset and three public medical MIML benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework. On the ANA dataset, our model achieves up to +7.0% F1-Macro and +12.6% mAP gains over the best prior method, setting new state-of-the-art results. It also ranks top-2 across all key metrics on public datasets, reducing Hamming loss and one-error by up to 18.2% and 26.9%, respectively.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have shown great promise in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, and similar efforts are now emerging in the Earth Observation community. These models aim to generalize across tasks with limited supervision, reducing the need for training separate models for each task. However, current strategies, which largely focus on scaling model size and dataset volume, require prohibitive computational and data resources, limiting accessibility to only a few large institutions. Moreover, this paradigm of ever-larger models stands in stark contrast with the principles of sustainable and environmentally responsible AI, as it leads to immense carbon footprints and resource inefficiency. In this work, we present a novel and efficient alternative: an Ensemble-of-Specialists framework for building Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). Our method decomposes the training process into lightweight, task-specific ConvNeXtV2 specialists that can be frozen and reused. This modular approach offers strong advantages in efficiency, interpretability, and extensibility. Moreover, it naturally supports federated training, pruning, and continuous specialist integration, making it particularly well-suited for collaborative and resource-constrained settings. Our framework sets a new direction for building scalable and efficient RSFMs.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating disorder marked by a decline in cognitive function. Timely identification of the disease is essential for the development of personalized treatment strategies that aim to mitigate its progression. The application of generated images for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease poses challenges, particularly in accurately representing the disease's characteristics when input sequences are captured at irregular time intervals. This study presents an innovative methodology for sequential image generation, guided by quantitative metrics, to maintain the essential features indicative of disease progression. Furthermore, an age-scaling factor is integrated into the process to produce age-specific MRI images, facilitating the prediction of advanced stages of the disease. The results obtained from the ablation study suggest that the inclusion of quantitative metrics significantly improves the accuracy of MRI image synthesis. Furthermore, the application of age-scaled pixel loss contributed to the enhanced iterative generation of MRI images. In terms of long-term disease prognosis, the Structural Similarity Index reached a peak value of 0.882, indicating a substantial degree of similarity in the synthesized images.

TL;DR: PRFL 是一种在潜在空间中进行奖励反馈学习的框架，通过利用预训练视频生成模型处理噪声潜在表示的能力，实现了端到端的高效优化。相比传统的像素空间方法，PRFL 在减少内存消耗和训练时间的同时，显著提升了与人类偏好的对齐度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频奖励模型依赖于为像素空间输入设计的视觉-语言模型，导致奖励反馈学习（ReFL）仅能在接近完全去噪的阶段进行，限制了早期监督，并且增加了计算开销和内存使用。此外，这种后期优化主要关注视觉质量，而忽视了运动动态和结构连贯性等关键因素。因此，需要一种更高效、更全面的方法来实现视频生成中的偏好优化。

Method: 提出 Process Reward Feedback Learning (PRFL)，将奖励建模与优化过程置于噪声潜在空间中，利用预训练视频生成模型对任意时间步的噪声潜在表示进行处理的能力，结合其序列建模特性以保持时间信息，从而支持在整个去噪链中进行高效的梯度反传，无需经过昂贵的 VAE 解码步骤。

Result: 实验表明，PRFL 在提升与人类偏好的对齐度方面表现优异，同时大幅降低了内存占用和训练时间，相较于基于 RGB 空间的 ReFL 方法具有明显优势。

Conclusion: PRFL 证明了在潜在空间中进行视频生成的奖励反馈学习是可行且高效的，不仅克服了传统方法的局限性，还为未来高效率、高质量视频生成提供了新范式。

Abstract: Reward feedback learning (ReFL) has proven effective for aligning image generation with human preferences. However, its extension to video generation faces significant challenges. Existing video reward models rely on vision-language models designed for pixel-space inputs, confining ReFL optimization to near-complete denoising steps after computationally expensive VAE decoding. This pixel-space approach incurs substantial memory overhead and increased training time, and its late-stage optimization lacks early-stage supervision, refining only visual quality rather than fundamental motion dynamics and structural coherence. In this work, we show that pre-trained video generation models are naturally suited for reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process noisy latent representations at arbitrary timesteps and inherently preserve temporal information through their sequential modeling capabilities. Accordingly, we propose Process Reward Feedback Learning~(PRFL), a framework that conducts preference optimization entirely in latent space, enabling efficient gradient backpropagation throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRFL significantly improves alignment with human preferences, while achieving substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time compared to RGB ReFL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视角3D重建中的光照不一致是根本性挑战，尤其在无人机（UAV）重建中，长时间飞行和户外环境导致光照变化不可避免。现有数据集或时间窗口短（缺乏光照多样性），或跨度大（几何与语义变化干扰光照研究），难以独立评估光照鲁棒性。因此需要一个控制良好、真实且具有丰富光照变化的数据集。

Conclusion: UAVLight是一个高质量、可控且真实的基准，能够有效支持光照鲁棒性三维重建算法的研发与评估，填补了现有数据集在光照多样性与场景稳定性之间的空白。

Abstract: Illumination inconsistency is a fundamental challenge in multi-view 3D reconstruction. Variations in sunlight direction, cloud cover, and shadows break the constant-lighting assumption underlying both classical multi-view stereo (MVS) and structure from motion (SfM) pipelines and recent neural rendering methods, leading to geometry drift, color inconsistency, and shadow imprinting. This issue is especially critical in UAV-based reconstruction, where long flight durations and outdoor environments make lighting changes unavoidable. However, existing datasets either restrict capture to short time windows, thus lacking meaningful illumination diversity, or span months and seasons, where geometric and semantic changes confound the isolated study of lighting robustness. We introduce UAVLight, a controlled-yet-real benchmark for illumination-robust 3D reconstruction. Each scene is captured along repeatable, geo-referenced flight paths at multiple fixed times of day, producing natural lighting variation under consistent geometry, calibration, and viewpoints. With standardized evaluation protocols across lighting conditions, UAVLight provides a reliable foundation for developing and benchmarking reconstruction methods that are consistent, faithful, and relightable in real outdoor environments.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to learning-based 3D point cloud models, critically undermining their reliability in security-sensitive applications. Existing defense methods often suffer from (1) high computational overhead and (2) poor generalization ability across diverse attack types. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel yet efficient teacher-student framework, namely Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation (MRPD) for distilling robust 3D point cloud model. It learns lightweight prompts by aligning student point cloud model's features with robust embeddings from three distinct teachers: a vision model processing depth projections, a high-performance 3D model, and a text encoder. To ensure a reliable knowledge transfer, this distillation is guided by a confidence-gated mechanism which dynamically balances the contribution of all input modalities. Notably, since the distillation is all during the training stage, there is no additional computational cost at inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRPD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against a wide range of white-box and black-box attacks, while even achieving better performance on clean data. Our work presents a new, practical paradigm for building robust 3D vision systems by efficiently harnessing multimodal knowledge.

Our analysis reveals that this issue is rooted in three fundamental challenges of the joint diffusion process: (1) Correspondence Drift, where concurrently evolving noisy latents impede stable learning of alignment; (2) inefficient global attention mechanisms that fail to capture fine-grained temporal cues; and (3) the intra-modal bias of conventional Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which enhances conditionality but not cross-modal synchronization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Harmony, a novel framework that mechanistically enforces audio-visual synchronization. We first propose a Cross-Task Synergy training paradigm to mitigate drift by leveraging strong supervisory signals from audio-driven video and video-driven audio generation tasks. Then, we design a Global-Local Decoupled Interaction Module for efficient and precise temporal-style alignment. Finally, we present a novel Synchronization-Enhanced CFG (SyncCFG) that explicitly isolates and amplifies the alignment signal during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Harmony establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in both generation fidelity and, critically, in achieving fine-grained audio-visual synchronization.

Motivation: 口腔癌在全球范围内高发，常因与良性、癌前及恶性病变视觉相似而被延迟诊断。早期引入计算机辅助诊断系统有望显著改善临床结果。然而，受限于数据量小且类别分布不均，现有方法面临挑战，亟需更有效的分类模型。

Method: 结合分层数据分割、先进数据增强和过采样技术，构建基于深度学习的多类分类模型，对16种口腔病变进行识别与分类。

Result: 模型在测试集上达到83.33%的准确率、89.12%的精确率和77.31%的召回率，优于当前主流方法，尤其在少数类别分类性能方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架有效验证了数据增强与过采样策略在小样本、不平衡数据场景下的价值，为实现临床环境中口腔癌早期智能检测的可信计算机辅助诊断系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Oral cancer is highly common across the globe and is mostly diagnosed during the later stages due to the close visual similarity to benign, precancerous, and malignant lesions in the oral cavity. Implementing computer aided diagnosis systems early on has the potential to greatly improve clinical outcomes. This research intends to use deep learning to build a multiclass classifier for sixteen different oral lesions. To overcome the challenges of limited and imbalanced datasets, the proposed technique combines stratified data splitting and advanced data augmentation and oversampling to perform the classification. The experimental results, which achieved 83.33 percent accuracy, 89.12 percent precision, and 77.31 percent recall, demonstrate the superiority of the suggested model over state of the art methods now in use. The suggested model effectively conveys the effectiveness of oversampling and augmentation strategies in situations where the minority class classification performance is noteworthy. As a first step toward trustworthy computer aided diagnostic systems for the early detection of oral cancer in clinical settings, the suggested framework shows promise.

### [81] [Harmonic Token Projection (HTP): A Vocabulary-Free, Training-Free, Deterministic, and Reversible Embedding Methodology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20665)
*Tcharlies Schmitz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为谐波令牌投影（HTP）的新方法，无需训练、词汇表或随机参数即可生成文本嵌入。该方法通过将每个令牌的Unicode整数表示转换为谐波轨迹，实现符号与连续向量空间之间的双射且可解释的映射。其谐波结构保证了相位一致性，支持语义相似性估计，并在英文和多语言数据集上表现出稳定的性能（如英文STS-B上达到0.68的斯皮尔曼相关系数），计算开销极低，单句对延迟低于毫秒级。结果表明，仅通过确定性几何即可产生有意义的语义关系，为数据驱动嵌入提供了一种透明高效的替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经嵌入方法依赖于统计共现或优化过程，存在不可解释性、训练成本高、缺乏可逆性等问题。本文旨在探索一种无需训练、完全确定性的文本嵌入框架，以实现高效、可解释且可逆的语义表示。

Method: HTP将每个令牌的Unicode码点作为输入，通过构造基于其数值的谐波函数序列，生成一个连续向量空间中的轨迹。该轨迹具有明确的数学形式，确保映射的双射性和可逆性。通过几何对齐（如角度和距离）来估算语义相似性，不依赖任何学习参数。

Result: 在STS-B基准测试中，HTP在英语上取得了0.68的斯皮尔曼相关系数；在十种不同语言上的多语言扩展实验中表现稳定，且每对句子的处理延迟低于1毫秒，计算成本极低。

Conclusion: 本研究证明，仅通过确定性几何构造即可生成具有语义意义的文本嵌入，且具备可逆性、可解释性和高效性。这为传统数据驱动嵌入提供了新的思路，尤其适用于需要透明性和实时响应的应用场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Harmonic Token Projection (HTP), a reversible and deterministic framework for generating text embeddings without training, vocabularies, or stochastic parameters. Unlike neural embeddings that rely on statistical co-occurrence or optimization, HTP encodes each token analytically as a harmonic trajectory derived from its Unicode integer representation, establishing a bijective and interpretable mapping between discrete symbols and continuous vector space. The harmonic formulation provides phase-coherent projections that preserve both structure and reversibility, enabling semantic similarity estimation from purely geometric alignment. Experimental evaluation on the Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B) and its multilingual extension shows that HTP achieves a Spearman correlation of \r{ho} = 0.68 in English, maintaining stable performance across ten languages with negligible computational cost and sub-millisecond latency per sentence pair. This demonstrates that meaningful semantic relations can emerge from deterministic geometry, offering a transparent and efficient alternative to data-driven embeddings. Keywords: Harmonic Token Projection, reversible embedding, deterministic encoding, semantic similarity, multilingual representation.

*Yongfu Xue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PIRA提出一种新的训练范式，通过将问答对重构为基于偏好的指令、聚合多样偏好任务的奖励以减少偏差，并在不同丢弃率下平均价值头输出来稳定奖励，有效解决了传统判别式奖励模型数据效率低和易受奖励过优化影响的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统判别式奖励模型存在数据效率低和易受奖励过优化影响的问题，亟需改进以更好地对齐大语言模型与人类偏好。

Method: 将问题-回答对转化为基于偏好的指令；聚合多个偏好任务的奖励；在不同丢弃率下平均价值头输出以实现奖励稳定。

Result: 大量实验验证了PIRA的有效性，显著提升了奖励模型的性能与鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PIRA通过创新的训练策略有效缓解了奖励模型的数据效率低和奖励过优化问题，为大语言模型对齐人类偏好提供了更可靠的方法。

Abstract: Reward models are crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences but face two representative challenges. First, traditional discriminative reward models usually concatenate questions and responses directly as input, resulting in low data efficiency. Second, reward models are vulnerable to reward overoptimization. We propose PIRA, a training paradigm addressing these issues through three strategies: (1) Reformulating question-answer pairs into preference-based instructions for clearer and more explicit task specification, (2) aggregating rewards from diverse preference tasks to reduce bias and improve robustness, and (3) averaging value-head outputs under varying dropout rates to stabilize rewards. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of PIRA.

*Mann Khatri,Mirza Yusuf,Rajiv Ratn Shah,Ponnurangam Kumaraguru*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究大语言模型在法律领域的表现，通过三项零样本实验：重构法律文档以评估结构化信息对长上下文处理的影响；定义修辞角色以帮助模型熟悉法律术语；模拟法院的逐步推理过程。结果显示，结构化数据或解释关键法律术语可显著提升模型性能，F1分数最高提升4.36%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽具备强大通用推理能力，但在法律等专业领域表现不佳，主要因缺乏领域特定预训练。法律文档通常冗长复杂，传统模型难以高效处理。现有研究尝试通过上下文学习弥补知识缺口，但尚未充分探索如何优化模型对法律文本的理解与推理。

Method: 在三个印度法律判决预测数据集上进行零样本实验，分别测试：(i) 按修辞角色重组文档；(ii) 定义修辞角色以增强术语理解；(iii) 模拟法院的逐步推理流程。通过对比基线模型，分析不同策略对模型性能的影响。

Result: 结构化信息组织或术语解释可显著提升模型表现，F1分数最低提升约1.5%，最高达4.36%。其中，修辞角色定义和推理流程模拟均有效增强模型对法律文本的理解与决策能力。

Conclusion: 通过引入结构化信息、术语解释及类司法推理机制，可在不进行全量领域微调的情况下有效提升大语言模型在法律任务中的表现，为零样本法律推理提供可行路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive datasets from the web, exhibit remarkable general reasoning skills. Despite this, they often struggle in specialized areas like law, mainly because they lack domain-specific pretraining. The legal field presents unique challenges, as legal documents are generally long and intricate, making it hard for models to process the full text efficiently. Previous studies have examined in-context approaches to address the knowledge gap, boosting model performance in new domains without full domain alignment. In our paper, we analyze model behavior on legal tasks by conducting experiments in three areas: (i) reorganizing documents based on rhetorical roles to assess how structured information affects long context processing and model decisions, (ii) defining rhetorical roles to familiarize the model with legal terminology, and (iii) emulating the step-by-step reasoning of courts regarding rhetorical roles to enhance model reasoning. These experiments are conducted in a zero-shot setting across three Indian legal judgment prediction datasets. Our results reveal that organizing data or explaining key legal terms significantly boosts model performance, with a minimum increase of ~1.5% and a maximum improvement of 4.36% in F1 score compared to the baseline.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MindSET 是一个从 Reddit 收集的大型新基准数据集，包含超过 1300 万条基于自报告诊断标注的帖子，覆盖七种心理健康状况。该数据集通过严格的预处理（如语言过滤、移除 NSFW 及重复内容）确保质量，并利用 LIWC 进行语言学分析。实验表明，使用 MindSET 训练的模型在诊断检测任务中显著优于以往基准，尤其在自闭症检测上 F1 分数提升达 18 个百分点，为社交媒体与心理健康研究提供了强有力支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理健康分析基准数据集因数据过时、清洗不足及社交媒体内容多样性（如多语言、有害内容）而受限，难以满足当前研究需求。

Method: 从 Reddit 收集自报告诊断数据，进行语言过滤、移除 NSFW 及重复内容等预处理，构建大规模标注数据集；使用 LIWC 进行心理词汇频率分析；采用微调语言模型和 BoW 特征进行二分类实验验证数据集有效性。

Result: MindSET 数据集规模超过 1300 万条，是之前基准的两倍以上；基于该数据集训练的模型在诊断检测任务中表现显著提升，自闭症检测的 F1 分数最高提升 18 个百分点。

Conclusion: MindSET 提供了一个高质量、大规模且多样化的基准数据集，为社交媒体中的心理健康研究提供了坚实基础，支持早期风险识别和心理趋势分析。

Abstract: Social media data has become a vital resource for studying mental health, offering real-time insights into thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that traditional methods often miss. Progress in this area has been facilitated by benchmark datasets for mental health analysis; however, most existing benchmarks have become outdated due to limited data availability, inadequate cleaning, and the inherently diverse nature of social media content (e.g., multilingual and harmful material). We present a new benchmark dataset, \textbf{MindSET}, curated from Reddit using self-reported diagnoses to address these limitations. The annotated dataset contains over \textbf{13M} annotated posts across seven mental health conditions, more than twice the size of previous benchmarks. To ensure data quality, we applied rigorous preprocessing steps, including language filtering, and removal of Not Safe for Work (NSFW) and duplicate content. We further performed a linguistic analysis using LIWC to examine psychological term frequencies across the eight groups represented in the dataset. To demonstrate the dataset utility, we conducted binary classification experiments for diagnosis detection using both fine-tuned language models and Bag-of-Words (BoW) features. Models trained on MindSET consistently outperformed those trained on previous benchmarks, achieving up to an \textbf{18-point} improvement in F1 for Autism detection. Overall, MindSET provides a robust foundation for researchers exploring the intersection of social media and mental health, supporting both early risk detection and deeper analysis of emerging psychological trends.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FlexCode提出一种流行度感知的框架，通过动态分配固定令牌预算，在协同过滤（CF）代码本和语义代码本之间实现自适应平衡，提升生成推荐模型的表示效率与泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成推荐方法使用单一统一的代码本编码所有物品，忽视了热门物品（富含协同信号）与长尾物品（依赖语义理解）之间的内在不平衡，限制了表示效率和泛化能力。

Method: 引入FlexCode框架，利用轻量级MoE动态平衡CF精度与语义泛化，并设计对齐与平滑目标以保持跨流行度谱的一致性。

Result: 在公共及工业规模数据集上的实验表明，FlexCode持续优于强基线，显著提升推荐准确率与长尾物品鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FlexCode为基于令牌的推荐模型提供了新的表征机制，实现了更强的准确性与尾部鲁棒性，为记忆与泛化之间的平衡提供了新视角。

Abstract: Generative recommendation has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm that unifies retrieval and generation, representing items as discrete semantic tokens and enabling flexible sequence modeling with autoregressive models. Despite its success, existing approaches rely on a single, uniform codebook to encode all items, overlooking the inherent imbalance between popular items rich in collaborative signals and long-tail items that depend on semantic understanding. We argue that this uniform treatment limits representational efficiency and hinders generalization. To address this, we introduce FlexCode, a popularity-aware framework that adaptively allocates a fixed token budget between a collaborative filtering (CF) codebook and a semantic codebook. A lightweight MoE dynamically balances CF-specific precision and semantic generalization, while an alignment and smoothness objective maintains coherence across the popularity spectrum. We perform experiments on both public and industrial-scale datasets, showing that FlexCode consistently outperform strong baselines. FlexCode provides a new mechanism for token representation in generative recommenders, achieving stronger accuracy and tail robustness, and offering a new perspective on balancing memorization and generalization in token-based recommendation models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出首个阿拉伯语文本到SQL数据集Ar-SParC，涵盖超过1万条问题与SQL映射；通过40组实验验证不同提示工程方法，提出GAT corrector新方法，在零样本和上下文学习场景中均显著提升准确率；消融实验证明其对阿拉伯语更有效，推动多语言自然语言数据库交互研究发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前跨领域、上下文相关的文本到SQL任务主要集中在英语和中文，缺乏对阿拉伯语的研究。为填补这一空白，本文提出首个阿拉伯语的跨领域、上下文相关的文本到SQL数据集Ar-SParC。

Method: 构建了Ar-SParC数据集，包含3,450个相关问题序列，共10,225个问题及对应SQL查询；使用GPT-3.5-turbo和GPT-4.5-turbo进行40次实验，采用10种提示工程方法（包括4种问题表示方法和6种上下文学习技术）；提出一种名为GAT corrector的新方法，并通过消融实验分析其优于先前GAT verifier的原因。

Result: GAT corrector在零样本设置下平均提升执行准确率（EX）1.9%、交互准确率（IX）1.9%；在上下文学习设置下平均提升EX 1.72%、IX 0.92%；消融实验表明该方法特别适合阿拉伯语语言特性。

Conclusion: Ar-SParC是首个阿拉伯语跨领域、上下文相关的文本到SQL数据集，所提出的GAT corrector显著提升了模型性能，尤其适用于阿拉伯语，为后续多语言文本到SQL研究提供了重要基础。

Abstract: In recent years, the task of cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL has received significant attention. Enables users with no prior knowledge of SQL to have a conversation with databases using natural language. However, most of the available datasets and research have been conducted in English, along with some work in Chinese. To this date, no effort has been made to address this task in the Arabic language. In this paper, we introduce Ar-SParC, the first Arabic cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL dataset. The dataset consists of 3,450 sequences of interrelated questions, each sequence containing an average of approximately three questions, which results in a total of 10225 questions along with their corresponding SQL queries. We conducted 40 experiments on the Ar-SParC dataset using two large language models, GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4.5-turbo, applying 10 different prompt engineering techniques, including four question representation methods and six in-context learning techniques. Furthermore, we developed a novel approach named GAT corrector, which enhanced the performance across all 40 experiments, yielding an average improvement of 1.9% in execution accuracy (EX) and 1.9% in interaction accuracy (IX) under zero-shot settings, and an average increase of 1.72% EX and 0.92% IX under in-context learning settings. Finally, we conducted an ablation study with two more experiments to explain why the GAT corrector outperformed the previous GAT verifier technique, particularly for the Arabic language.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种用于评估大型语言模型在肿瘤学决策支持中推理错误的分层分类法，发现23%的推理存在错误，主要为确认偏倚和锚定偏倚，且与指南不一致或潜在有害的临床建议相关。尽管自动化评估器可检测错误存在，但无法准确分类子类型。研究提出一个可推广的框架，以提升模型推理的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型虽在临床基准测试中表现优异，但可能通过有缺陷的推理得出正确结论，这种安全风险在仅依赖准确率的评估中无法被捕捉，尤其在肿瘤学决策支持中具有重要影响。因此需要一种系统方法来识别和评估模型的推理错误。

Method: 本研究基于CORAL数据集中的乳腺癌和胰腺癌病历，对600条GPT-4的思维链输出进行标注，构建了一个三级推理错误分类法，映射计算失败与认知偏差框架；随后在前列腺癌咨询病历（涵盖局限性至转移性疾病）上验证该分类法的临床相关性，分析了提取、分析与临床建议任务中的推理错误模式。

Result: 23%的推理存在错误，其中确认偏倚和锚定偏倚最为常见；推理失败与指南不符及潜在有害的治疗建议显著相关，尤其是在晚期疾病管理中；尽管先进的语言模型能检测到错误的存在，但无法可靠区分具体错误类型。

Conclusion: 大语言模型可能在推理存在缺陷的情况下提供流畅但临床上不安全的建议。提出的分类法为评估和改进模型推理的准确性提供了通用框架，有助于在临床部署前提升其安全性与可信度。

Abstract: Despite high performance on clinical benchmarks, large language models may reach correct conclusions through faulty reasoning, a failure mode with safety implications for oncology decision support that is not captured by accuracy-based evaluation. In this two-cohort retrospective study, we developed a hierarchical taxonomy of reasoning errors from GPT-4 chain-of-thought responses to real oncology notes and tested its clinical relevance. Using breast and pancreatic cancer notes from the CORAL dataset, we annotated 600 reasoning traces to define a three-tier taxonomy mapping computational failures to cognitive bias frameworks. We validated the taxonomy on 822 responses from prostate cancer consult notes spanning localized through metastatic disease, simulating extraction, analysis, and clinical recommendation tasks. Reasoning errors occurred in 23 percent of interpretations and dominated overall errors, with confirmation bias and anchoring bias most common. Reasoning failures were associated with guideline-discordant and potentially harmful recommendations, particularly in advanced disease management. Automated evaluators using state-of-the-art language models detected error presence but could not reliably classify subtypes. These findings show that large language models may provide fluent but clinically unsafe recommendations when reasoning is flawed. The taxonomy provides a generalizable framework for evaluating and improving reasoning fidelity before clinical deployment.

*Bharadwaj Yadavalli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出动态模板选择（DTS）机制，通过自适应匹配查询复杂度与响应模板，显著降低大语言模型部署中的令牌开销，实现成本节约且不牺牲响应质量。实验表明，采用轻量级MLP路由器在1,000个MMLU问题上达到90.5%的路由准确率，优于参数量更大的RoBERTa模型。该方法具备跨提供商泛化能力，在OpenAI GPT-4、Google Gemini和Anthropic Claude上均表现稳定，令牌消耗减少32.6%至33.9%。研究还提供了形式化问题建模、四类算法及其复杂度分析，并通过大规模生产环境验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型部署普遍使用统一提示策略，对复杂分析任务和简单事实问答均采用冗长响应模式，造成严重令牌效率低下。由于输出令牌成本是输入令牌的4-8倍，这种低效策略导致显著的成本浪费。因此亟需一种能根据查询复杂度动态调整响应模板的方法以提升效率并降低成本。

Method: 提出动态模板选择（DTS）框架，设计两种路由策略：基于预计算嵌入的轻量级MLP路由器和更复杂的微调RoBERTa Transformer。通过比较两者在查询复杂度上的分类能力，实现响应模板的智能匹配。同时在多提供商环境下进行大规模真实API调用测试，验证其泛化性能。

Result: MLP路由器在1,000个MMLU问题上达到90.5%的路由准确率，略高于RoBERTa（89.5%），但参数量少1.25亿；在三个主流LLM提供商（GPT-4、Gemini、Claude）上均保持约90.5%的路由准确率，令牌消耗平均减少32.6%至33.9%，表现出良好的跨平台泛化能力。

Conclusion: 动态模板选择（DTS）能够有效提升大语言模型部署的令牌效率，实现显著成本降低，同时保持高质量输出。所提出的轻量级路由方案兼具高效性与可扩展性，适用于多厂商异构环境，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Contemporary large language model deployments typically employ uniform prompting strategies across diverse query types, applying verbose response patterns to both complex analytical tasks and straightforward factual questions. This one-size-fits-all methodology leads to substantial token inefficiency, a concern amplified by the significant cost differential between input and output tokens--the latter commanding 4-8x higher prices across major providers. We present Dynamic Template Selection (DTS), which adaptively matches response templates to query complexity, achieving significant cost reductions without compromising response quality.
  We compared two routing approaches: a simple MLP that uses pre-computed embeddings and a more complex fine-tuned RoBERTa transformer. Through comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 MMLU questions, we find that the MLP router achieves 90.5% routing accuracy on held-out test data, marginally exceeding RoBERTa's performance (89.5%) despite utilizing 125M fewer parameters. Notably, our empirical analysis reveals provider-agnostic behavior in template selection--routing decisions generalize effectively across 3 major LLM providers (OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude), as validated through 9,000 production API calls. While routing accuracy remains consistent at 90.5% across providers, observed token reductions vary from 32.6% to 33.9%, reflecting provider-specific generation characteristics.
  This work contributes several key elements: formal problem formulation with theoretical grounding in machine learning, four algorithms with corresponding complexity analyses, and extensive empirical validation across production systems.

*Trung Cuong Dang,David Mohaisen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的多前缀记忆化框架，用于更准确地检测大语言模型中的训练数据记忆现象。该框架的核心思想是：被记忆的序列由于深度编码，可通过大量不同的前缀被检索到，而非记忆内容则不具备这种特性。通过定义一个序列是否被记忆为‘可被外部对抗性搜索识别出足够数量的不同前缀’，该方法从检索路径的多样性角度衡量记忆的鲁棒性，从而有效区分记忆与非记忆内容。实验表明，该方法在开源和对齐聊天模型中均能可靠识别数据泄露问题，具有良好的实用性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆化定义在捕捉大语言模型尤其是对齐模型中的记忆现象时存在不足，难以全面反映记忆的本质，尤其在隐私与版权风险日益凸显的背景下，亟需一种更精准、可靠的评估方法。

Method: 提出多前缀记忆化框架，通过外部对抗性搜索检测目标序列能否被多个不同前缀触发，将记忆性定义为检索路径的多样性，即记忆序列具有更高的前缀可检索性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架能有效区分记忆与非记忆内容，在开源和对齐模型中均表现出良好的区分能力和稳定性，为检测大语言模型中的数据泄露提供了可靠工具。

Conclusion: 多前缀记忆化框架通过量化记忆的检索路径多样性，提供了一种更全面、稳健的记忆检测方法，有助于提升大语言模型在隐私和版权方面的安全性与可审计性。

Abstract: Large language models, trained on massive corpora, are prone to verbatim memorization of training data, creating significant privacy and copyright risks. While previous works have proposed various definitions for memorization, many exhibit shortcomings in comprehensively capturing this phenomenon, especially in aligned models. To address this, we introduce a novel framework: multi-prefix memorization. Our core insight is that memorized sequences are deeply encoded and thus retrievable via a significantly larger number of distinct prefixes than non-memorized content. We formalize this by defining a sequence as memorized if an external adversarial search can identify a target count of distinct prefixes that elicit it. This framework shifts the focus from single-path extraction to quantifying the robustness of a memory, measured by the diversity of its retrieval paths. Through experiments on open-source and aligned chat models, we demonstrate that our multi-prefix definition reliably distinguishes memorized from non-memorized data, providing a robust and practical tool for auditing data leakage in LLMs.

Result: 1) HELM基线平均低估模型性能4%；2) 性能波动增加2%标准差；3) 3个基准上领导者排名发生翻转；4) 引入链式思维后，模型对提示设计的敏感性下降，性能更稳定。

Conclusion: 结构化提示与自动优化能够显著提升语言模型评估的准确性与一致性。本研究首次大规模实证揭示了提示方法对基准评估结果的影响，强调性能天花板估计对构建可靠评估框架的重要性。相关工具已开源以促进可复现研究。

Abstract: As language models (LMs) are increasingly adopted across domains, high-quality benchmarking frameworks that accurately estimate performance are essential for guiding deployment decisions. While frameworks such as Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) enable broad evaluation across tasks, they often rely on fixed prompts that fail to generalize across LMs, yielding unrepresentative performance estimates. Unless we estimate each LM's ceiling (maximum achievable via changes to the prompt), we risk underestimating performance. Declarative prompting frameworks, such as DSPy, offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering by crafting structured prompts that can be optimized per task. However, such frameworks have not been systematically evaluated across established benchmarks. We present a reproducible DSPy+HELM framework that introduces structured prompting methods which elicit reasoning, enabling more accurate LM benchmarking. Using four prompting methods, we evaluate four frontier LMs across seven benchmarks (general/medical domain) against existing HELM baseline scores. We find that without structured prompting: (i) HELM underestimates LM performance (by 4% average), (ii) performance estimates vary more across benchmarks (+2% standard deviation), (iii) performance gaps are misrepresented (leaderboard rankings flip on 3/7 benchmarks), and (iv) introducing reasoning (chain-of-thought) reduces LM sensitivity to prompt design (smaller Δ across prompts). To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale benchmarking study to empirically characterize LM behavior across benchmarks and prompting methods, showing that scalable performance ceiling estimation enables more decision-useful benchmarks. We open-source (i) DSPy+HELM Integration (https://github.com/stanford-crfm/helm/pull/3893) and (ii) Prompt Optimization Pipeline (https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/dspy-helm).

*Dong Dong,Weijie Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种新型分词器Length-MAX，通过优化平均每个字符的标记长度，显著减少训练和推理时所需的标记数量。相比BPE，在多种词汇表大小下减少14–18%的标记数，且在不同规模GPT-2模型上实现更少训练步数、更低延迟和更高吞吐量，同时提升下游任务表现，具备高词汇覆盖率与低未登录率，兼容生产系统并降低内存占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分词方法如BPE主要基于频率优化，但可能导致较长的平均标记长度，影响效率。本文旨在通过最小化平均字符对应的标记数，提升语言模型的训练与推理效率。

Method: 将长度加权目标最大化建模为图划分问题，并设计贪心近似算法生成词汇表，从而获得更高效的分词策略。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型规模上，比BPE减少14–18%的标记数；训练步数减少17–18.5%，推理延迟降低12.7–13.7%，吞吐量提升16%；下游任务性能提高，如LAMBADA困惑度下降11.7%，HellaSwag准确率提升4.3%；词汇覆盖率达99.62%，未登录率仅0.12%。

Conclusion: 优化平均标记长度而非仅频率，是一种有效提升语言模型效率的方法，可在不牺牲甚至提升下游性能的前提下实现更优的训练与推理效率，且具备实际部署可行性。

Abstract: We introduce a new tokenizer for language models that minimizes the average tokens per character, thereby reducing the number of tokens needed to represent text during training and to generate text during inference. Our method, which we refer to as the Length-MAX tokenizer, obtains its vocabulary by casting a length-weighted objective maximization as a graph partitioning problem and developing a greedy approximation algorithm. On FineWeb and diverse domains, it yields 14--18\% fewer tokens than Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) across vocabulary sizes from 10K to 50K, and the reduction is 13.0\% when the size is 64K. Training GPT-2 models at 124M, 355M, and 1.3B parameters from scratch with five runs each shows 18.5\%, 17.2\%, and 18.5\% fewer steps, respectively, to reach a fixed validation loss, and 13.7\%, 12.7\%, and 13.7\% lower inference latency, together with a 16\% throughput gain at 124M, while consistently improving on downstream tasks including reducing LAMBADA perplexity by 11.7\% and enhancing HellaSwag accuracy by 4.3\%. Moreover, the Length-MAX tokenizer achieves 99.62\% vocabulary coverage and the out-of-vocabulary rate remains low at 0.12\% on test sets. These results demonstrate that optimizing for average token length, rather than frequency alone, offers an effective approach to more efficient language modeling without sacrificing -- and often improving -- downstream performance. The tokenizer is compatible with production systems and reduces embedding and KV-cache memory by 18\% at inference.

### [93] [Evo-Memory: Benchmarking LLM Agent Test-time Learning with Self-Evolving Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20857)
*Tianxin Wei,Noveen Sachdeva,Benjamin Coleman,Zhankui He,Yuanchen Bei,Xuying Ning,Mengting Ai,Yunzhe Li,Jingrui He,Ed H. Chi,Chi Wang,Shuo Chen,Fernando Pereira,Wang-Cheng Kang,Derek Zhiyuan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evo-Memory introduces a streaming benchmark and framework to evaluate self-evolving memory in LLM agents, addressing the lack of dynamic memory management in continuous task streams. It structures datasets into sequential tasks requiring ongoing memory adaptation, evaluates over ten memory modules across diverse datasets, and proposes ReMem—a pipeline integrating reasoning, actions, and memory updates for continual improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of LLM memory are limited to static conversational settings, failing to capture the dynamic need for memory evolution in real-world applications like interactive assistants or embodied agents, where continuous learning from past interactions is crucial.

Method: Evo-Memory constructs sequential task streams to simulate real-world deployment, enabling models to retrieve, adapt, and evolve memory iteratively. It includes a unified evaluation framework with over ten memory modules and introduces ExpRAG as a baseline and ReMem as a novel action-think-memory refinement pipeline.

Result: ReMem demonstrates superior performance in experience reuse and continual improvement compared to existing methods, highlighting the importance of tightly integrating reasoning, actions, and memory updates during deployment.

Conclusion: Evo-Memory provides a comprehensive testbed for evaluating self-evolving memory in LLM agents, revealing critical limitations in current approaches and offering a pathway toward more adaptive, long-term intelligent systems.

Abstract: Statefulness is essential for large language model (LLM) agents to perform long-term planning and problem-solving. This makes memory a critical component, yet its management and evolution remain largely underexplored. Existing evaluations mostly focus on static conversational settings, where memory is passively retrieved from dialogue to answer queries, overlooking the dynamic ability to accumulate and reuse experience across evolving task streams. In real-world environments such as interactive problem assistants or embodied agents, LLMs are required to handle continuous task streams, yet often fail to learn from accumulated interactions, losing valuable contextual insights, a limitation that calls for test-time evolution, where LLMs retrieve, integrate, and update memory continuously during deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce Evo-Memory, a comprehensive streaming benchmark and framework for evaluating self-evolving memory in LLM agents. Evo-Memory structures datasets into sequential task streams, requiring LLMs to search, adapt, and evolve memory after each interaction. We unify and implement over ten representative memory modules and evaluate them across 10 diverse multi-turn goal-oriented and single-turn reasoning and QA datasets. To better benchmark experience reuse, we provide a baseline method, ExpRAG, for retrieving and utilizing prior experience, and further propose ReMem, an action-think-memory refine pipeline that tightly integrates reasoning, task actions, and memory updates to achieve continual improvement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探索了跨语言论点挖掘在低资源语言中的应用，通过三种训练场景：零样本迁移、基于大语言模型的合成数据增强，以及结合英波双语数据的跨语言模型。实验表明，跨语言模型在波斯语测试集上达到74.8%的F1分数，优于其他方法，证明轻量级跨语言融合是克服低资源语言数据短缺的有效途径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言在论点挖掘任务中因数据稀缺导致的性能瓶颈，探索有效的跨语言迁移策略以提升模型在非高资源语言上的表现。

Method: 设计三种训练场景：(i) 仅使用英语数据的零样本迁移；(ii) 英语数据结合大语言模型生成的合成数据；(iii) 融合原始英语数据与人工翻译的波斯语句子的跨语言模型。评估基于英语Microtext语料库及其波斯语平行翻译。

Result: 零样本迁移模型在英语和波斯语测试集上分别获得50.2%和50.7%的F1分数；基于LLM的数据增强模型在英语和波斯语上分别提升至59.2%和69.3%；跨语言模型在波斯语测试集上达到74.8%的F1分数，表现最优。

Conclusion: 轻量级跨语言融合方法显著优于依赖大量合成数据的增强方案，为低资源语言的论点挖掘提供了一条高效可行的技术路径。

Abstract: Argument mining is a subfield of natural language processing to identify and extract the argument components, like premises and conclusions, within a text and to recognize the relations between them. It reveals the logical structure of texts to be used in tasks like knowledge extraction. This paper aims at utilizing a cross-lingual approach to argument mining for low-resource languages, by constructing three training scenarios. We examine the models on English, as a high-resource language, and Persian, as a low-resource language. To this end, we evaluate the models based on the English Microtext corpus \citep{PeldszusStede2015}, and its parallel Persian translation. The learning scenarios are as follow: (i) zero-shot transfer, where the model is trained solely with the English data, (ii) English-only training enhanced by synthetic examples generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), and (iii) a cross-lingual model that combines the original English data with manually translated Persian sentences. The zero-shot transfer model attains F1 scores of 50.2\% on the English test set and 50.7\% on the Persian test set. LLM-based augmentation model improves the performance up to 59.2\% on English and 69.3\% on Persian. The cross-lingual model, trained on both languages but evaluated solely on the Persian test set, surpasses the LLM-based variant, by achieving a F1 of 74.8\%. Results indicate that a lightweight cross-lingual blend can outperform considerably the more resource-intensive augmentation pipelines, and it offers a practical pathway for the argument mining task to overcome data resource shortage on low-resource languages.

*Nura Aljaafari,Danilo S. Carvalho,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种结合角色交叉最小对、时间涌现分析和跨模型比较的方法，研究大语言模型如何实现语义角色。研究发现：(i) 语义结构由高度集中的电路（89-94%归因于28个节点）实现；(ii) 结构逐步优化而非突变，大模型有时会绕过局部电路；(iii) 跨尺度存在中等程度的保守性（24-59%组件重叠）与高谱相似性。结果表明，大语言模型形成紧凑且因果隔离的抽象语义机制，且这些机制在不同规模和架构间具有部分可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽表现出语义能力，但其内部如何实现抽象语义结构仍不清晰，亟需深入解析其内在机制。

Method: 采用角色交叉最小对、时间涌现分析和跨模型比较相结合的方法，系统考察语义角色在模型中的实现路径与演化特征。

Result: (i) 语义功能高度集中于少数节点（89-94%归因于28个节点）；(ii) 模型结构呈现渐进式优化，无明显相变，大模型可能跳过局部电路；(iii) 不同规模模型间存在中等程度的组件重叠（24-59%）和高谱相似性。

Conclusion: 大语言模型通过紧凑、因果隔离的电路实现抽象语义结构，且这些机制在不同规模和架构间具有部分可迁移性，支持语义表示的稳定性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Despite displaying semantic competence, large language models' internal mechanisms that ground abstract semantic structure remain insufficiently characterised. We propose a method integrating role-cross minimal pairs, temporal emergence analysis, and cross-model comparison to study how LLMs implement semantic roles. Our analysis uncovers: (i) highly concentrated circuits (89-94% attribution within 28 nodes); (ii) gradual structural refinement rather than phase transitions, with larger models sometimes bypassing localised circuits; and (iii) moderate cross-scale conservation (24-59% component overlap) alongside high spectral similarity. These findings suggest that LLMs form compact, causally isolated mechanisms for abstract semantic structure, and these mechanisms exhibit partial transfer across scales and architectures.

*Reham Omar,Abdelghny Orogat,Ibrahim Abdelaziz,Omij Mangukiya,Panos Kalnis,Essam Mansour*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chatty-KG 是一个模块化多智能体系统，用于在知识图谱（KG）上进行对话式问答。它结合了检索增强生成（RAG）与结构化执行，通过任务专用的LLM智能体生成SPARQL查询，实现自然语言问题到可执行查询的高效转换。该系统在单轮和多轮设置下均显著优于现有基线，具备高准确率、低延迟、无需微调或预处理的特点，且兼容多种商业和开源大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KGQA系统在多轮对话支持、上下文跟踪和动态知识图谱适应方面存在局限；而大语言模型虽能生成自然对话，却缺乏对私有、动态知识图谱的直接访问能力。因此需要一种既能保持对话灵活性又能利用结构化知识的高效解决方案。

Method: 提出Chatty-KG，采用模块化多智能体架构，各智能体分别负责上下文理解、实体/关系链接、对话状态跟踪与查询规划，协同生成精确的SPARQL查询，实现基于知识图谱的多轮对话问答。

Result: 在多个大型多样化的知识图谱上实验表明，Chatty-KG在单轮和多轮任务中均显著优于当前最优方法，获得更高的F1和P@1分数；系统具备良好的可扩展性与稳定性，支持无须微调的动态知识更新，并兼容GPT-4o、Gemini-2.0、Phi-4、Gemma 3等主流大模型。

Conclusion: Chatty-KG成功融合了对话系统的灵活性与知识图谱的结构性优势，提供了一种可扩展、可扩展性强、适用于真实场景的多轮知识图谱问答新范式。

Abstract: Conversational Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) combines the factual grounding of KG-based QA with the interactive nature of dialogue systems. KGs are widely used in enterprise and domain applications to provide structured, evolving, and reliable knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) enable natural and context-aware conversations, but lack direct access to private and dynamic KGs. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems can retrieve graph content but often serialize structure, struggle with multi-turn context, and require heavy indexing. Traditional KGQA systems preserve structure but typically support only single-turn QA, incur high latency, and struggle with coreference and context tracking. To address these limitations, we propose Chatty-KG, a modular multi-agent system for conversational QA over KGs. Chatty-KG combines RAG-style retrieval with structured execution by generating SPARQL queries through task-specialized LLM agents. These agents collaborate for contextual interpretation, dialogue tracking, entity and relation linking, and efficient query planning, enabling accurate and low-latency translation of natural questions into executable queries. Experiments on large and diverse KGs show that Chatty-KG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both single-turn and multi-turn settings, achieving higher F1 and P@1 scores. Its modular design preserves dialogue coherence and supports evolving KGs without fine-tuning or pre-processing. Evaluations with commercial (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0) and open-weight (e.g., Phi-4, Gemma 3) LLMs confirm broad compatibility and stable performance. Overall, Chatty-KG unifies conversational flexibility with structured KG grounding, offering a scalable and extensible approach for reliable multi-turn KGQA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大语言模型（LLMs）在回答非定义类问题时的表现下降，使用TrackList分析预训练数据的影响，并引入RefoMed-EN医学术语数据集。结果显示，定义类问题表现最佳，例证类问题最差；且模型对高频概念更倾向于生成改写，对低频技术性知识则较少改写。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在提供定义类答案方面表现良好，但在处理例子、释义等多样化问题时表现不佳，需要探究其背后原因及影响因素。

Method: 采用TrackList进行细粒度的语言学与统计分析，结合人工标注的RefoMed-EN数据集，通过句法与语义相似性、统计相关性及嵌入向量评估模型输出质量，分析头尾概念频率对模型性能的影响。

Result: 定义类问题的回答质量最高，例证类最低；模型对高频概念更易生成改写，对低频技术性知识改写较少，尤其在专业文本中表现明显。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在处理不同类型的自然语言查询时存在显著差异，其表现受预训练数据中概念频率的影响，尤其在专业领域中对低频术语的理解和表达能力较弱。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven efficient in giving definition-type answers to user input queries. While for humans giving various types of answers, such as examples and paraphrases, is an easy task, LLMs struggle to provide correct answers for other than definition-type queries. In this study, we evaluated this drop in performance using TrackList, a fine-grained linguistic and statistical analysis pipeline to investigate the impact of the pre-training data on LLMs answers to diverse linguistic queries. We also introduce RefoMed-EN, an English dataset consisting of 6170 human-annotated medical terms alongside their corresponding definitions, denominations, exemplifications, explanations, or paraphrases. We studied whether the high frequency of a concept (head) or low frequency (tail) impacts the language model's performance. We evaluated the quality of the LLM's output using syntactic and semantic similarity metrics, statistical correlations and embeddings. Results showed that the LLM's task performance for definition type questions is the highest, while for the exemplification type it is the lowest. Additionally, we showed that for definition-type questions, large language models are prone to paraphrase more on popular and frequent knowledge and less on tail and technical knowledge, especially in the expert texts.

*Anantha Padmanaban Krishna Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了上下文学习（ICL）是否能颠覆预训练模型的标签语义，还是仅对已有语义结构进行微调。通过对比自然演示（正确标签）与反转演示（系统性翻转标签含义），发现ICL在多数情况下维持了预训练阶段形成的语义锚点，无法真正实现标签语义的覆盖。即使在反转演示下，模型也无法建立一致的反向语义分类器，且语义覆盖率为零。结果表明，ICL主要是在预训练中已稳定的语义方向上调整输入投影，而非灵活重映射标签意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究上下文学习（ICL）是否能够颠覆预训练模型中的标签语义，还是仅对已有语义结构进行微调。理解ICL的本质有助于揭示大语言模型在少样本学习中的行为边界。

Method: 将LLMs视为提示诱导分类器，设计自然演示与反转演示两种实验设置；引入三个对齐度量（真实、先验、提示对齐）；定义语义覆盖率作为衡量模型能否在标签反转条件下仍保持准确性的指标。

Result: 在八种分类任务和八种开源LLM（1–12B参数）上，自然演示下ICL提升准确率但保持强先验对齐；反转演示下，模型无法建立有效的反向语义分类器，提示对齐虽提高但以牺牲准确率为代价，语义覆盖率为零。

Conclusion: ICL并非灵活地重映射标签语义，而是基于预训练中形成的稳定语义方向进行输入投影调整。在当前规模下，要实现标签语义的真正覆盖，需超越ICL的干预手段。

Abstract: Can in-context learning (ICL) override pre-trained label semantics, or does it merely refine an existing semantic backbone? We address this question by treating LLMs as prompt-induced classifiers and contrasting their behavior under \emph{natural} demonstrations (with correct labels) and \emph{inverted} demonstrations (systematically flipping label meanings). We decompose ICL behavior into three alignment metrics (truth, prior, and prompt alignment) and introduce a semantic override rate, defined as correctness under flipped semantics. Across eight classification tasks and eight open-source LLMs (1--12B parameters), we find consistent evidence for a semantic anchor view. With natural demonstrations, ICL improves accuracy while maintaining strong prior alignment; most correct predictions coincide with zero-shot behavior, even when the prior is weak. With inverted demonstrations, models cannot learn coherent anti-semantic classifiers: prompt alignment increases only by sacrificing accuracy, and semantic override rates remain exactly zero in our few-shot 1--12B setting. Rather than flexibly remapping label meanings, ICL primarily adjusts how inputs project onto stable semantic directions learned during pre-training, clarifying fundamental limits of few-shot prompting and suggesting that overriding label semantics at these scales requires interventions beyond ICL.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KANs, especially EfficientKAN and FasterKAN, outperform or match MLPs in low-resource Burmese text classification, offering better expressiveness and efficiency with various embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLPs used in low-resource language classification have fixed non-linearity and high computational cost, limiting performance; this study explores KANs as more expressive and efficient alternatives.

Method: The study evaluates FourierKAN, EfficientKAN, and FasterKAN as classification heads on TF-IDF, fastText, mBERT, and Distil-mBERT embeddings for Burmese text classification, comparing them to traditional MLPs.

Result: EfficientKAN with fastText achieved the highest F1-score (0.928); FasterKAN offered the best speed-accuracy trade-off; on transformer embeddings, EfficientKAN matched or slightly exceeded MLP performance (e.g., 0.917 F1 with mBERT).

Conclusion: KANs are highly effective, expressive, and efficient alternatives to MLPs for classification in low-resource languages like Burmese.

Abstract: In low-resource languages like Burmese, classification tasks often fine-tune only the final classification layer, keeping pre-trained encoder weights frozen. While Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are commonly used, their fixed non-linearity can limit expressiveness and increase computational cost. This work explores Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as alternative classification heads, evaluating Fourier-based FourierKAN, Spline-based EfficientKAN, and Grid-based FasterKAN-across diverse embeddings including TF-IDF, fastText, and multilingual transformers (mBERT, Distil-mBERT). Experimental results show that KAN-based heads are competitive with or superior to MLPs. EfficientKAN with fastText achieved the highest F1-score (0.928), while FasterKAN offered the best trade-off between speed and accuracy. On transformer embeddings, EfficientKAN matched or slightly outperformed MLPs with mBERT (0.917 F1). These findings highlight KANs as expressive, efficient alternatives to MLPs for low-resource language classification.

*Bryan E. Tuck,Rakesh M. Verma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了三种模型家族（Qwen3、Claude Haiku-4.5、GPT-5-mini）共28种配置在58个需要字符级约束满足的词汇谜题上的表现。结果显示，架构差异导致的性能差距（F1=0.761 vs. 0.343，差距2.0-2.2倍）远大于同家族内参数量扩展带来的提升（八倍参数仅带来83%增益），表明约束满足能力可能依赖于特定架构特征或训练目标，而非单纯参数规模。高容量模型对思维预算敏感度高，而中等规模模型则趋于饱和或退化，说明计算资源投入并非均匀有效。尽管模型与人类解题表现间存在适度校准（相关系数r=0.24-0.38），但在拼写异常但符合规则的常见词（如"data", "poop", "loll"）上模型错误率高达89-96%，远超人类失败率，暴露模型过度依赖分布合理性而忽视正交性约束的问题，提示需超越参数和算力扩展的架构创新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在受控文本生成中必须满足严格的拼写约束，但现有研究缺乏跨架构系统的评估。当前方法主要依赖参数扩展和计算资源增加，但其在处理字符级约束任务中的有效性尚未充分验证，尤其在面对拼写异常但合法的词语时表现不佳，亟需系统性评估以揭示模型瓶颈并推动架构改进。

Method: 对28种不同配置的三个主流模型家族（Qwen3、Claude Haiku-4.5、GPT-5-mini）进行测试，涵盖58个要求精确字符级约束满足的词汇谜题；通过比较不同架构、参数规模与思维预算下的表现，分析性能差异来源；结合10,000名人类解题者的难度评分数据，评估模型与人类之间的校准程度，并识别模型在特定拼写模式下的系统性失败。

Result: 架构差异造成的性能差距（F1=0.761 vs. 0.343）显著超过同家族内参数扩展带来的收益（八倍参数仅提升83%）；高容量模型对思维预算敏感，而中等规模模型趋于饱和或下降；模型与人类解题表现存在适度校准（r=0.24-0.38），但在拼写异常但合法的词语（如"data", "poop", "loll"）上模型失败率高达89-96%，远高于人类水平，表明模型过度依赖分布合理性，忽略正交性约束。

Conclusion: 当前语言模型在字符级约束满足任务中表现受限，主要源于对分布合理性而非正交性约束的过度依赖。单纯扩大参数量或计算预算无法解决根本问题，未来需引入专门针对正交性约束设计的架构或训练机制，以实现更可靠的受控文本生成。

Abstract: Large language models must satisfy hard orthographic constraints during controlled text generation, yet systematic cross-architecture evaluation remains limited. We evaluate 28 configurations spanning three model families (Qwen3, Claude Haiku-4.5, GPT-5-mini) on 58 word puzzles requiring character-level constraint satisfaction. Architectural differences produce substantially larger performance gaps (2.0-2.2x, F1=0.761 vs. 0.343) than parameter scaling within families (83% gain from eightfold scaling), suggesting that constraint satisfaction may require specialized architectural features or training objectives beyond standard language model scaling. Thinking budget sensitivity proves heterogeneous: high-capacity models show strong returns (+0.102 to +0.136 F1), while mid-sized variants saturate or degrade. These patterns are inconsistent with uniform compute benefits. Using difficulty ratings from 10,000 human solvers per puzzle, we establish modest but consistent calibration (r=0.24-0.38) across all families, yet identify systematic failures on common words with unusual orthography ("data", "poop", "loll": 86-95% human success, 89-96% model miss rate). These failures reveal over-reliance on distributional plausibility that penalizes orthographically atypical but constraint-valid patterns, suggesting architectural innovations may be required beyond simply scaling parameters or computational budgets.

TL;DR: 该研究首次针对低资源缅甸语提出了自动语音识别（ASR）错误纠正（AEC）的序列到序列Transformer模型，探索了音标（IPA）和对齐信息等特征融合策略。实验表明，结合IPA与对齐特征的AEC模型显著提升了词级和字符级准确率，将平均词错误率（WER）从51.56降至39.82（未增强时）和43.59（增强后），同时chrF++得分从0.5864提升至0.627，验证了AEC在低资源场景下的有效性及特征设计的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缅甸语属于低资源语言，现有ASR系统存在较高错误率，亟需有效方法进行错误纠正。此前缺乏针对缅甸语的ASR错误纠正研究，因此本文旨在填补这一空白，探索适用于低资源条件下的有效纠错策略。

Method: 采用序列到序列Transformer架构，评估五种ASR骨干模型，并引入IPA音标与对齐信息作为辅助特征，构建ASR错误纠正（AEC）模型，通过对比有无AEC的性能差异验证方法有效性。

Result: 所提出的AEC模型在未数据增强情况下将平均WER从51.56降低至39.82，在数据增强后降至43.59；chrF++得分由0.5864提升至0.627，表明在词级和字符级准确率上均有显著提升，且效果稳定优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 本研究证明了ASR错误纠正模型在低资源缅甸语中的有效性，强调了合理特征设计对提升ASR输出质量的关键作用，为未来低资源语言语音识别系统优化提供了可行路径。

Abstract: This paper investigates sequence-to-sequence Transformer models for automatic speech recognition (ASR) error correction in low-resource Burmese, focusing on different feature integration strategies including IPA and alignment information. To our knowledge, this is the first study addressing ASR error correction specifically for Burmese. We evaluate five ASR backbones and show that our ASR Error Correction (AEC) approaches consistently improve word- and character-level accuracy over baseline outputs. The proposed AEC model, combining IPA and alignment features, reduced the average WER of ASR models from 51.56 to 39.82 before augmentation (and 51.56 to 43.59 after augmentation) and improving chrF++ scores from 0.5864 to 0.627, demonstrating consistent gains over the baseline ASR outputs without AEC.

*Manish Jain,Satheesh Kumar Ponnambalam,Salman Faroz,Chandrakanth Lns,Vinay Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MortgageLLM 是一个针对抵押贷款金融领域的专用大语言模型，采用双专家架构，分别优化对话问答和结构化任务（如分类与摘要），通过指令残差技术在不依赖监督微调的情况下恢复指令遵循能力。该模型结合智能任务路由机制，显著提升在专业领域内的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型虽具备通用能力，但在抵押贷款等专业领域需增强领域知识，同时保持指令遵循能力。单一多任务模型在优化结构化任务时会损害对话质量，因此需要一种既能专精又不牺牲通用性的解决方案。

Method: 提出双轨专业化框架，基于同一基础模型（LLaMA-3.1-8B）构建两个专家模型：一个用于对话问答，另一个用于结构化任务；使用指令残差技术恢复指令遵循性；引入由专家自身执行的少样本分类实现智能任务路由。

Result: 在多个领域基准测试中，MortgageLLM v2 显著优于基线模型（如 LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct），在摘要、问答和分类任务上的得分均大幅提升，且在语义相似度（BERTScore）方面也表现出明显优势。

Conclusion: MortgageLLM 证明了双专家架构与指令残差技术在高度专业化领域的有效性，为大语言模型在金融等垂直行业落地提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across general domains, yet their application to specialized sectors such as mortgage finance requires domain-specific knowledge augmentation while preserving instruction-following fidelity. We present MortgageLLM, a novel domain-specific large language model that addresses this dual challenge. It is developed using a dual-track specialization framework from a single base model (LLaMA-3.1-8B). We opted for this dual-expert approach as a single multi-task model suffers from performance trade-offs, where optimizing for structured tasks (via SFT) degrades conversational fidelity (via DPO). Our dual-track method solves this by creating two specialists, allowing each to be optimally trained for its distinct capability. Our approach applies the instruction residual technique to restore instruction-following capabilities post-domain adaptation without supervised fine-tuning. We contribute: (1) application of this residual technique to the highly specialized mortgage finance domain; (2) a dual-expert architecture combining a conversational Q&A model and a structured task model for classification and summarization; and (3) an intelligent task routing mechanism using few-shot classification performed by one of the expert models itself. We validate our approach on domain-specific benchmarks, where our final model (MLM v2) significantly outperforms the base LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, achieving an LLM-as-a-Judge summarization score of 4.58 (vs. 3.99), a Q&A score of 4.09 (vs. 4.0), and a classification score of 2.6 (vs. 1.2). On semantic similarity, our model achieved a BERTScore of 0.77 for summarization (vs. 0.74), 0.68 for Q&A (vs. 0.58), and 0.75 for classification (vs. 0.73), substantially outperforming baseline approaches.

*Yuhang Wang,Yanxu Zhu,Dongyuan Lu,Jitao Sang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SGASA是一种新型的自适应安全对齐框架，通过内化模型生成的安全指南来增强模型对有害对抗性提示的鲁棒性，同时减少对良性请求的误拒。该框架包含数据预合成和对齐微调两个阶段，利用SFT和DPO方法将安全指南嵌入模型，在多个数据集上验证了其在提升模型安全性方面的显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理模型虽具备强大复杂推理能力，但易受隐蔽且欺骗性的对抗性越狱提示攻击，导致生成有害内容。现有安全机制难以有效防御此类攻击，亟需一种能够自主强化防御能力的自适应安全对齐方法。

Method: 提出SGASA框架，包括两个阶段：1）数据预合成阶段，生成安全指南与增强提示；2）对齐微调阶段，采用监督微调（SFT）和直接偏好优化（DPO）将安全指南嵌入模型。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，SGASA显著提升了模型的安全性，验证了其自适应性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: SGASA框架通过内化模型生成的安全指南，有效增强了模型对有害对抗性提示的防御能力，同时保持对良性请求的合理响应，为大模型安全对齐提供了高效可行的新路径。

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, ensuring their safety against adversarial jailbreak prompts remains a critical challenge. Due to the covert and deceptive nature of such prompts, they can often evade built-in safety mechanisms and lead to the generation of harmful content. This underscores the need for an adaptive safety alignment approach that enables models to autonomously reinforce their defenses in response to adversarial inputs. This paper introduces the Synthesized Guideline-based Adaptive Safety Alignment (SGASA) framework, which internalizes model-generated safety guidelines to strengthen models' ability to enhance robustness against harmful adversarial prompts while minimizing unnecessary refusals of benign requests. SGASA consists of two key stages: Data Pre-synthesis, which generates safety guidelines and augmented prompts; and Alignment Fine-tuning, which leverages Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to embed these guidelines into the model. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SGASA significantly improves model safety, validating its adaptive and scalable effectiveness.

*Steven Wang,Kyle Hunt,Shaojie Tang,Kenneth Joseph*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了微调小型人类调查数据是否能改善大语言模型（LLM）在模拟调查与实验研究中的表现。通过对比人类与LLM生成的回应，发现微调显著提升了多样性、群体对齐性和信念-行为一致性，但即使表现最佳的微调模型也无法复现原始研究的回归系数，表明LLM数据仍不适合用于正式推断性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前学术界对大语言模型能否替代人类参与者进行调查和实验研究存在争议。尽管已有研究探索了LLM模拟的潜力，但大量证据表明其与真实人类行为存在偏差，包括多样性不足、少数群体系统性偏离、组内方差过低以及陈述信念与实际行为不一致等问题。因此，亟需探究微调小规模人类数据是否可缓解这些问题。

Method: 本研究基于一项关于信息披露的行为实验，比较人类与大语言模型生成的数据在多个维度上的表现，包括分布差异、子群体对齐度、信念-行为一致性以及回归系数的恢复能力。通过在少量人类调查数据上对大语言模型进行微调，并评估其模拟效果。

Result: 微调后的大语言模型在异质性、群体对齐性和信念-行为一致性方面显著优于基线模型。然而，即便表现最优的微调模型仍无法准确再现原始研究中的回归系数，说明其生成的数据不足以支持正式的统计推断。

Conclusion: 尽管微调小规模人类数据可在一定程度上提升大语言模型在模拟人类行为时的表现，但其生成的数据仍然无法完全替代真实人类参与者的数据，尤其在需要精确因果推断的研究中不宜使用。

Abstract: There is ongoing debate about whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as substitutes for human participants in survey and experimental research. While recent work in fields such as marketing and psychology has explored the potential of LLM-based simulation, a growing body of evidence cautions against this practice: LLMs often fail to align with real human behavior, exhibiting limited diversity, systematic misalignment for minority subgroups, insufficient within-group variance, and discrepancies between stated beliefs and actions. This study examines an important and distinct question in this domain: whether fine-tuning on a small subset of human survey data, such as that obtainable from a pilot study, can mitigate these issues and yield realistic simulated outcomes. Using a behavioral experiment on information disclosure, we compare human and LLM-generated responses across multiple dimensions, including distributional divergence, subgroup alignment, belief-action coherence, and the recovery of regression coefficients. We find that fine-tuning on small human samples substantially improves heterogeneity, alignment, and belief-action coherence relative to the base model. However, even the best-performing fine-tuned models fail to reproduce the regression coefficients of the original study, suggesting that LLM-generated data remain unsuitable for replacing human participants in formal inferential analyses.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了首个面向泰语依善方言的开放对话语音数据集的开发，该数据集包含自然口语，涵盖俚语、自发语调、不流畅现象及频繁与中部泰语的代码切换。由于依善语缺乏标准化拼写系统，当前书写实践因泰语与依善语词汇声调差异而存在较大变体，给转录指南设计带来挑战。为此，研究者制定了兼顾表征准确性和计算处理需求的实用转录协议，并将该数据集作为开放资源发布，旨在推动包容性人工智能发展，支持低资源语言研究，为对话语音建模中的语言和技术挑战提供解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发首个面向依善方言的开放对话语音数据集，以应对现有语音语料库多基于朗读或脚本化语音的局限性，捕捉真实口语中的自然语言现象；同时解决依善语缺乏标准化拼写系统带来的转录难题，促进低资源语言的研究与技术应用。

Method: 制定实用的转录协议，在保证语言表征准确性的同时兼顾计算处理的需求；通过采集自然对话语音，构建首个开放的依善语对话语音数据集。

Conclusion: 该数据集的发布为依善语的语音处理与自然语言理解研究奠定了基础，有助于推动包容性AI的发展，提升对非主流语言的建模能力，并为未来在类似语言资源匮乏情境下的研究提供可借鉴的方法论。

Abstract: This paper introduces the development of the first open conversational speech dataset for the Isan language, the most widely spoken regional dialect in Thailand. Unlike existing speech corpora that are primarily based on read or scripted speech, this dataset consists of natural speech, thereby capturing authentic linguistic phenomena such as colloquials, spontaneous prosody, disfluencies, and frequent code-switching with central Thai. A key challenge in building this resource lies in the lack of a standardized orthography for Isan. Current writing practices vary considerably, due to the different lexical tones between Thai and Isan. This variability complicates the design of transcription guidelines and poses questions regarding consistency, usability, and linguistic authenticity. To address these issues, we establish practical transcription protocols that balance the need for representational accuracy with the requirements of computational processing. By releasing this dataset as an open resource, we aim to contribute to inclusive AI development, support research on underrepresented languages, and provide a basis for addressing the linguistic and technical challenges inherent in modeling conversational speech.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了PEFT-Bench，一个用于评估自回归大语言模型中多种参数高效微调（PEFT）方法的统一端到端基准测试平台。该平台在27个NLP数据集上对6种PEFT方法进行了评估，并引入了PEFT软评分惩罚（PSCP）指标，综合考虑可训练参数量、推理速度和训练内存使用等因素，以更全面地衡量PEFT方法的性能与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前PEFT方法虽然发展迅速，但其评估范围有限且难以复现，无法全面反映不同方法在实际应用中的表现，因此需要一个统一、可复现的基准测试框架来系统评估各类PEFT方法的性能与效率。

Method: 提出PEFT-Bench基准测试平台，涵盖27个NLP数据集和6种主流PEFT方法；设计PSCP指标，综合考虑可训练参数量、推理速度和训练内存使用，实现对PEFT方法的多维度评估。

Result: PEFT-Bench能够有效支持对多种PEFT方法的系统性评估，PSCP指标能更合理地权衡性能与资源消耗，为选择适合特定场景的PEFT方法提供量化依据。

Conclusion: PEFT-Bench为评估参数高效微调方法提供了统一、可复现且全面的基准，有助于推动该领域的公平比较与持续发展。

Abstract: Despite the state-of-the-art performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) achieved on many tasks, their massive scale often leads to high computational and environmental costs, limiting their accessibility. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods address this challenge by reducing the number of trainable parameters while maintaining strong downstream performance. Despite the increased development in PEFT methods, current evaluations remain limited (in terms of evaluated models and datasets) and difficult to reproduce. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEFT-Bench, a unified end-to-end benchmark for evaluating diverse PEFT methods on autoregressive LLMs. We demonstrate its usage across 27 NLP datasets and 6 PEFT methods. To account for different PEFT training and inference factors, we also introduce the PEFT Soft Score Penalties (PSCP) metric, which takes trainable parameters, inference speed, and training memory usage into account.

*Kai Kugler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究首次系统性地考察了神经语言模型训练过程中生成文本的马丁定律（词频与多义性之间的经验关系）。通过使用DBSCAN聚类上下文嵌入来操作化词义，分析了四个Pythia模型（70M-1B参数）在30个训练检查点上的表现。结果显示，马丁定律在第100个检查点左右出现，于第104个检查点达到最高相关性（r > 0.6），随后在第105个检查点开始退化。小模型（70M、160M）在后期检查点经历灾难性语义崩溃，而大模型（410M、1B）则表现出渐进式退化。频率特异性权衡保持稳定（r ≈ -0.3）。研究表明，语言模型生成文本对语言规律的符合性并非随训练单调提升，而是遵循一个平衡轨迹，并存在最优语义窗口。该工作建立了一种评估神经语言模型中涌现语言结构的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索神经语言模型在训练过程中是否以及如何逐渐形成符合人类语言规律（如马丁定律）的结构，揭示语言规律在模型中的动态演化机制。

Method: 采用DBSCAN聚类技术对模型生成文本的上下文嵌入进行聚类，以识别和量化词义；分析四个不同规模的Pythia模型（70M-1B参数）在30个训练检查点上的表现，评估马丁定律的演变及其与其他语言规律的关系。

Result: 马丁定律在训练中期（检查点100-104）达到峰值相关性（r > 0.6），之后开始退化；小模型出现语义崩溃，大模型则呈现渐进退化；频率特异性权衡始终稳定（r ≈ -0.3）。

Conclusion: 语言模型生成文本对语言规律的符合性并非单调增长，而是存在一个最优语义窗口，表明语言结构的涌现具有阶段性与平衡性特征。该研究为评估模型中语言结构的演化提供了新方法。

Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of Martin's Law - the empirical relationship between word frequency and polysemy - in text generated by neural language models during training. Using DBSCAN clustering of contextualized embeddings as an operationalization of word senses, we analyze four Pythia models (70M-1B parameters) across 30 training checkpoints. Our results reveal a non-monotonic developmental trajectory: Martin's Law emerges around checkpoint 100, reaches peak correlation (r > 0.6) at checkpoint 104, then degrades by checkpoint 105. Smaller models (70M, 160M) experience catastrophic semantic collapse at late checkpoints, while larger models (410M, 1B) show graceful degradation. The frequency-specificity trade-off remains stable (r $\approx$ -0.3) across all models. These findings suggest that compliance with linguistic regularities in LLM-generated text is not monotonically increasing with training, but instead follows a balanced trajectory with an optimal semantic window. This work establishes a novel methodology for evaluating emergent linguistic structure in neural language models.

TL;DR: 本文通过微调7B参数语言模型，使其能够可靠检测单个标记位置注入的短暂‘思想’，将准确率从0.4%提升至85%，且无误报。模型能保留并跨生成步骤报告语义内容，满足Lindsey提出的三个标准：准确性、接地性与内在性。结果表明，可直接训练模型实现部分内省行为，为提升AI透明性提供路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究是否可通过直接训练而非等待涌现，使语言模型具备内省能力，以解决跨模型差异问题。

Method: 对7B参数模型进行微调，针对瞬时单标记注入的‘思想’任务，评估其检测与报告能力，并测试泛化性能。

Result: 模型在保持0%误报率的同时，达到85%的准确率，且在未见概念向量上表现良好（7.5个百分点差距），证明学习到可迁移技能。

Conclusion: 可直接训练语言模型实现部分内省行为，为构建内置透明性提供可行方案，回应了关于训练内省能否减少跨模型差异的开放问题。

Abstract: Lindsey (2025) investigates introspective awareness in language models through four experiments, finding that models can sometimes detect and identify injected activation patterns -- but unreliably (~20% success in the best model). We focus on the first of these experiments -- self-report of injected "thoughts" -- and ask whether this capability can be directly trained rather than waiting for emergence. Through fine-tuning on transient single-token injections, we transform a 7B parameter model from near-complete failure (0.4% accuracy, 6.7% false positive rate) to reliable detection (85% accuracy on held-out concepts at α=40, 0% false positives). Our model detects fleeting "thoughts" injected at a single token position, retains that information, and reports the semantic content across subsequent generation steps. On this task, our trained model satisfies three of Lindsey's criteria: accuracy (correct identification), grounding (0/60 false positives), and internality (detection precedes verbalization). Generalization to unseen concept vectors (7.5pp gap) demonstrates the model learns a transferable skill rather than memorizing specific vectors, though this does not establish metacognitive representation in Lindsey's sense. These results address an open question raised by Lindsey: whether "training for introspection would help eliminate cross-model differences." We show that at least one component of introspective behavior can be directly induced, offering a pathway to built-in AI transparency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究针对捷克语和斯洛伐克语评论中事实性错误信息的细粒度证据抽取问题，构建了由付费标注者标注的双向细粒度证据数据集，并评估大语言模型（LLM）在该数据集上的表现。结果显示，尽管模型参数量较大，但部分模型如gpt-oss-120b表现不佳；而较小的llama3.1:8b模型反而表现出较高的正确率，qwen3:14b、deepseek-r1:32b和gpt-oss:20b则在模型规模与人类标注对齐性之间取得良好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线新闻评论中虚假信息频繁传播，亟需有效方法检测事实错误。为支持或反驳评论中的主张，需精准识别相关文档及具体文本段落作为证据，因此本研究聚焦于捷克语和斯洛伐克语环境下细粒度证据抽取任务。

Method: 构建包含双向标注的细粒度证据数据集，使用大语言模型在该数据集上进行评估，分析其生成结果与人类标注的一致性，并通过错误率分析比较不同模型的表现。

Result: LLMs 常无法准确复制源文本中的证据内容，导致输出无效；尽管参数量大，gpt-oss-120b 表现较差；llama3.1:8b 在小模型中表现优异；qwen3:14b、deepseek-r1:32b 与 gpt-oss:20b 在模型大小与人类标注对齐性之间实现良好平衡。

Conclusion: 细粒度证据抽取对打击虚假信息至关重要，模型性能不仅取决于参数量，更依赖于与人类判断的一致性。小模型在某些任务中表现优于大模型，表明优化模型结构与训练策略比单纯增加参数更为关键。

Abstract: Misinformation frequently spreads in user comments under online news articles, highlighting the need for effective methods to detect factually incorrect information. To strongly support or refute claims extracted from such comments, it is necessary to identify relevant documents and pinpoint the exact text spans that justify or contradict each claim. This paper focuses on the latter task -- fine-grained evidence extraction for Czech and Slovak claims. We create new dataset, containing two-way annotated fine-grained evidence created by paid annotators. We evaluate large language models (LLMs) on this dataset to assess their alignment with human annotations. The results reveal that LLMs often fail to copy evidence verbatim from the source text, leading to invalid outputs. Error-rate analysis shows that the {llama3.1:8b model achieves a high proportion of correct outputs despite its relatively small size, while the gpt-oss-120b model underperforms despite having many more parameters. Furthermore, the models qwen3:14b, deepseek-r1:32b, and gpt-oss:20b demonstrate an effective balance between model size and alignment with human annotations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DSR-SQL提出一种双状态推理框架，通过自适应上下文状态和渐进生成状态的交互，解决复杂企业数据库中Text-to-SQL任务的上下文限制、模式链接不可靠和语义接地弱的问题。该方法在无需微调或上下文示例的情况下，在Spider 2.0-Snow和BIRD数据集上分别达到35.28%和68.32%的执行准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Chain-of-Thought的分解-求解方法在处理复杂企业数据库时受限于上下文容量、不可靠的模式链接和薄弱的数据库语义对齐，导致推理不连贯。

Method: DSR-SQL采用双状态推理框架：第一状态通过精炼大模式并选择相关结构构建紧凑且语义忠实的环境；第二状态将SQL合成建模为反馈引导的状态转移过程，支持模型自我修正以对齐用户意图。

Result: 在无需后训练或上下文示例的前提下，DSR-SQL在Spider 2.0-Snow上实现35.28%的执行准确率，在BIRD开发集上达到68.32%的执行准确率。

Conclusion: DSR-SQL通过双状态机制有效提升了大语言模型在复杂数据库上的Text-to-SQL能力，展示了在无额外训练条件下实现高精度与强鲁棒性的潜力。

Abstract: Recent divide-and-conquer reasoning approaches, particularly those based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT), have substantially improved the Text-to-SQL capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, when applied to complex enterprise databases, such methods struggle to maintain coherent reasoning due to limited context capacity, unreliable schema linking, and weak grounding in database semantics. To overcome these issues, we introduce DSR-SQL, a \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{S}tate \textbf{R}easoning framework that models Text-to-SQL as an interaction between an adaptive context state and a progressive generation state. The first constructs a compact, semantically faithful environment by refining large schemas and selecting relevant structures, while the second formalizes SQL synthesis as feedback-guided state transitions, enabling the model to self-correct and align with user intent. Without any post-training or in-context examples, DSR-SQL achieves competitive performance, reaching 35.28\% execution accuracy on Spider 2.0-Snow and 68.32\% on BIRD development set. Our implementation will be open-sourced at: https://github.com/DMIRLAB-Group/DSR-SQL.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Odin 是一种新型架构，通过在 Transformer 的特定深度注入图结构信息，实现文本与图结构的高效融合。它避免了 GNN 的过平滑和多跳传播问题，同时克服了纯 Transformer 忽视图拓扑的缺陷。该方法在不同层次上抽象图结构，与语义层次对齐，并通过全局 [CLS] 表示实现无过平滑的聚合。轻量版 Light Odin 保持相同结构抽象，但计算成本更低。实验表明，Odin 在多个文本丰富图数据集上达到领先性能，Light Odin 则在效率和性能间取得良好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在处理文本属性图时存在两大局限：GNN 因多跳传播导致过平滑且依赖邻居范围；而纯 Transformer 忽视图拓扑，将节点视为孤立序列。因此需要一种能有效结合文本理解与图结构信息、避免上述缺陷的新方法。

Method: 提出 Odin 架构，采用定向双模块机制，在 Transformer 的特定层注入图结构信息。通过在不同深度进行低、中、高阶结构抽象，使结构信息与语义层次对齐。利用全局 [CLS] 向量进行聚合，避免过平滑，并解耦结构抽象与图拓扑或邻域大小的关系。进一步设计轻量版 Light Odin，以提升大规模或资源受限场景下的效率。

Result: Odin 在多个文本丰富的图基准数据集上达到当前最优性能；Light Odin 在显著降低计算开销的同时，仍保持竞争力。实验证明 Odin 的表达能力严格强于纯 Transformer 和 GNN。

Conclusion: Odin 及其轻量版本 Light Odin 构成一个统一、无需依赖跳跃传播的结构-文本融合框架，为文本属性图建模提供了新的范式。源代码已开源。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs require models to effectively combine strong textual understanding with structurally informed reasoning. Existing approaches either rely on GNNs--limited by over-smoothing and hop-dependent diffusion--or employ Transformers that overlook graph topology and treat nodes as isolated sequences. We propose Odin (Oriented Dual-module INtegration), a new architecture that injects graph structure into Transformers at selected depths through an oriented dual-module mechanism.Unlike message-passing GNNs, Odin does not rely on multi-hop diffusion; instead, multi-hop structures are integrated at specific Transformer layers, yielding low-, mid-, and high-level structural abstraction aligned with the model's semantic hierarchy. Because aggregation operates on the global [CLS] representation, Odin fundamentally avoids over-smoothing and decouples structural abstraction from neighborhood size or graph topology. We further establish that Odin's expressive power strictly contains that of both pure Transformers and GNNs.To make the design efficient in large-scale or low-resource settings, we introduce Light Odin, a lightweight variant that preserves the same layer-aligned structural abstraction for faster training and inference. Experiments on multiple text-rich graph benchmarks show that Odin achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while Light Odin delivers competitive performance with significantly reduced computational cost. Together, Odin and Light Odin form a unified, hop-free framework for principled structure-text integration. The source code of this model has been released at https://github.com/hongkaifeng/Odin.

TL;DR: 该研究系统评估了六种先进的模型合并方法在四种开源大语言模型上的表现，发现最简单的方法Task Arithmetic在大语言模型上仍能稳定提升性能，而其他更复杂的干扰感知和子空间合并方法反而导致显著性能下降。结果表明现有合并技术无法直接适用于现代大语言模型，亟需设计针对大语言模型的专用合并算法和合并感知的微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型合并技术在小模型和分类器上表现良好，但其优势是否适用于大语言模型尚不明确，亟需系统评估以指导后续算法设计。

Method: 对六种主流合并方法在四类开源大语言模型、每类12个微调检查点及16个标准评测基准上进行大规模、系统性评估，通过标准化基准测试衡量合并模型超越基础模型的概率以及相对于最优单个检查点的相对收益。

Result: Task Arithmetic是唯一能在大语言模型上稳定带来性能提升的方法；其他干扰感知与子空间合并方法普遍导致性能下降。

Conclusion: 现有模型合并技术不能直接迁移到现代大语言模型，需要开发专门的大语言模型合并算法和合并感知的微调策略。

Abstract: Model merging combines multiple fine-tuned checkpoints into a single model without additional training, offering an attractive approach to reusing models and efficiently improving performance. However, it remains unclear whether the advantages reported for smaller models and classifiers generalize to LLMs. We present a large-scale, systematic evaluation of six state-of-the-art merging methods, including recent subspace methods, across four open-weight LLMs, twelve fine-tuned checkpoints per base model, and sixteen standard LLM benchmarks. Evaluating through standardized benchmarks, we measure both the probability that a merged model outperforms the base model and relative gains over the best individual checkpoint. Our results show that the oldest and simplest method, Task Arithmetic, is the only approach that reliably yields performance gains on LLMs. Other interference-aware and subspace merging methods typically result in significant performance drops. Our findings indicate that current merging techniques do not directly transfer to modern LLMs. This motivates the design of LLM-specific merging algorithms and merging-aware fine-tuning methods. Code will be released upon acceptance of this paper.

In recent years, while deep learning technology has been gradually applied to readability assessment, most approaches fail to consider either the length of the text or the ordinal relationship of readability labels. This paper proposes a bidirectional readability assessment mechanism that captures contextual information to identify regions with rich semantic information in the text, thereby predicting the readability level of individual sentences. These sentence-level labels are then used to assist in predicting the overall readability level of the document. Additionally, a pairwise sorting algorithm is introduced to model the ordinal relationship between readability levels through label subtraction. Experimental results on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance and outperforms other baseline models.

*Lina Conti,Dennis Fucci,Marco Gaido,Matteo Negri,Guillaume Wisniewski,Luisa Bentivogli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了语音翻译（ST）模型在跨语言性别指代分配中的机制，发现模型并非简单复制训练数据中的性别关联，而是学习到更广泛的男性主导模式。尽管内部语言模型存在强烈男性偏见，但模型可基于声学输入进行修正。通过对比特征归因分析，发现高性别准确率的模型利用第一人称代词将性别化词汇与说话人关联，并从频谱分布中提取性别信息，而非依赖于音高集中特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音翻译（ST）在处理具有语法性别差异的语言时，可能因声学线索（如音高）导致说话人误性别化，尤其当源语言有显性性别而目标语言使用性别模糊术语时。当前对模型如何做出性别决策的理解有限，因此需要探究其背后的机制。

Method: 研究选取三种语言对（en-es/fr/it），分析训练数据模式、内部语言模型（ILM）偏见及声学信息的交互作用；采用对比特征归因方法对频谱图进行分析，识别模型在性别判断中使用的具体声学特征。

Result: 模型未直接复制训练数据中的性别关联，而是表现出普遍的男性主导倾向；虽然ILM存在强男性偏见，但模型能根据声学输入调整；高准确率模型通过第一人称代词建立与说话人的关联，并利用分布在频率谱中的性别信息，而非仅依赖音高。

Conclusion: 语音翻译模型在性别指代分配中展现出复杂且非直觉的机制：它们不仅受训练数据和语言模型偏见影响，还能通过整合声学特征与语义线索实现更准确的性别推断。这一发现揭示了新型声学-语义融合机制，提示未来模型设计应关注跨模态信息整合以减少偏见。

Abstract: Unlike text, speech conveys information about the speaker, such as gender, through acoustic cues like pitch. This gives rise to modality-specific bias concerns. For example, in speech translation (ST), when translating from languages with notional gender, such as English, into languages where gender-ambiguous terms referring to the speaker are assigned grammatical gender, the speaker's vocal characteristics may play a role in gender assignment. This risks misgendering speakers, whether through masculine defaults or vocal-based assumptions. Yet, how ST models make these decisions remains poorly understood. We investigate the mechanisms ST models use to assign gender to speaker-referring terms across three language pairs (en-es/fr/it), examining how training data patterns, internal language model (ILM) biases, and acoustic information interact. We find that models do not simply replicate term-specific gender associations from training data, but learn broader patterns of masculine prevalence. While the ILM exhibits strong masculine bias, models can override these preferences based on acoustic input. Using contrastive feature attribution on spectrograms, we reveal that the model with higher gender accuracy relies on a previously unknown mechanism: using first-person pronouns to link gendered terms back to the speaker, accessing gender information distributed across the frequency spectrum rather than concentrated in pitch.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在回答改写问题时表现出行为不一致，反映出其依赖表层模式而非深层语义理解的问题，亟需一种能有效评估和提升模型跨改写一致性能力的方法。

Method: 构建RoParQ基准，利用专有模型生成问题改写版本，并通过裁判模型筛选出导致模型信心不一致的样本；提出XParaCon评估指标，以标准差衡量模型在不同问题变体下的准确率波动；设计一种基于推理的、关注改写的监督微调（SFT）策略，引导模型实现语义不变性。

Result: 经过针对性对齐训练后，模型的跨改写一致性显著提升；轻量级模型在一致性表现上可媲美大型预训练模型，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的基准、评估指标与微调策略能够有效缓解大语言模型对表面模式的依赖，推动其向更稳健、可靠的语义理解方向发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit inconsistent behavior when answering paraphrased questions, suggesting a reliance on surface-level patterns rather than true semantic understanding. To address this limitation, we introduce RoParQ, a benchmark specifically constructed to evaluate cross-paraphrase consistency in closed-book multiple-choice QA. This benchmark is derived from standard datasets by generating paraphrases via proprietary models and selectively retaining examples that elicit inconsistent confidence from a judge model. We further propose XParaCon, a novel evaluation metric that quantifies a model's robustness by measuring the standard deviation of accuracies across question variants. Additionally, we implement a reasoning-based, paraphrase-aware Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategy designed to align models toward semantic invariance. Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted alignment significantly enhances robustness. Notably, fine-tuned lightweight models achieved consistency levels comparable to much larger pre-trained models. These results highlight the efficacy of our approach in mitigating superficial memorization and fostering more robust, reliable LLMs.

*Dan Li,Hye-Bin Shin,Yeon-Woo Choi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ProNECL框架，通过构建类级原型在不访问历史数据的情况下实现持续脑电（EEG）解码中的知识保留，有效解决跨被试持续学习中的遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖存储历史数据以防止遗忘，但面临隐私和内存限制问题，因此需要一种无需访问历史样本即可保留先验知识的持续学习方法。

Method: 构建类级原型以总结每个被试的判别性表示，并通过跨被试特征对齐与知识蒸馏，逐步将新特征空间与全局原型记忆对齐。

Result: 在BCI Competition IV 2a和2b数据集上验证，ProNECL在知识保留与适应能力之间取得良好平衡，显著提升跨被试持续EEG解码性能。

Conclusion: ProNECL无需访问历史数据即可有效实现持续学习，在保护隐私和降低内存负担的同时保持高性能，适用于实际应用中的持续脑电解码任务。

Abstract: Due to the significant variability in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals across individuals, knowledge acquired from previous subjects is often overwritten as new subjects are introduced in continual EEG decoding task. Current works mainly rely on storing the historical data of seen subjects as a replay buffer to prevent forgetting. However, privacy concerns or memory constraints make keeping such data impractical. Instead, we propose a Prototype-guided Non-Exemplar Continual Learning (ProNECL)framework that preserves prior knowledge without accessing any historical EEG samples. ProNECL constructs class-level prototypes to summarize discriminative representations from each subject and incrementally aligns new feature spaces with the global prototype memory through cross-subject feature alignment and knowledge distillation. Validated on the BCI Competition IV 2a and 2b datasets, our framework effectively balances knowledge retention and adaptability, achieving superior performance in cross-subject continual EEG decoding tasks.

Result: 在多个真实定义的切片上，不确定性驱动的主动学习方法表现最佳，仅用2-10%的切片成员信息便达到了与全量标注相当的准确率，且显著优于传统基线方法。

Conclusion: 主动切片发现是一种有效降低标注成本、提升错误切片识别效率的方法，尤其在使用不确定性采样策略时表现出色，适用于实际模型调试与公平性评估场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit systematic errors on specific subsets of data, known as error slices. For instance, a slice can correspond to a certain demographic, where a model does poorly in identifying toxic comments regarding that demographic. Identifying error slices is crucial to understanding and improving models, but it is also challenging. An appealing approach to reduce the amount of manual annotation required is to actively group errors that are likely to belong to the same slice, while using limited access to an annotator to verify whether the chosen samples share the same pattern of model mistake. In this paper, we formalize this approach as Active Slice Discovery and explore it empirically on a problem of discovering human-defined slices in toxicity classification. We examine the efficacy of active slice discovery under different choices of feature representations and active learning algorithms. On several slices, we find that uncertainty-based active learning algorithms are most effective, achieving competitive accuracy using 2-10% of the available slice membership information, while significantly outperforming baselines.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm, enabling a diverse range of data analytics and knowledge discovery tasks across scientific fields. Inspired by the success of FMs, particularly large language models, researchers have recently begun to explore spatio-temporal foundation models (STFMs) to improve adaptability and generalization across a wide spectrum of spatio-temporal (ST) tasks. Despite rapid progress, a systematic investigation of trajectory foundation models (TFMs), a crucial subclass of STFMs, is largely lacking. This tutorial addresses this gap by offering a comprehensive overview of recent advances in TFMs, including a taxonomy of existing methodologies and a critical analysis of their strengths and limitations. In addition, the tutorial highlights open challenges and outlines promising research directions to advance spatio-temporal general intelligence through the development of robust, responsible, and transferable TFMs.

Abstract: Globally interpretable models are a promising approach for trustworthy AI in safety-critical domains. Alongside global explanations, detailed local explanations are a crucial complement to effectively support human experts during inference. This work proposes the Calibrated Hierarchical QPM (CHiQPM) which offers uniquely comprehensive global and local interpretability, paving the way for human-AI complementarity. CHiQPM achieves superior global interpretability by contrastively explaining the majority of classes and offers novel hierarchical explanations that are more similar to how humans reason and can be traversed to offer a built-in interpretable Conformal prediction (CP) method. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that CHiQPM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy as a point predictor, maintaining 99% accuracy of non-interpretable models. This demonstrates a substantial improvement, where interpretability is incorporated without sacrificing overall accuracy. Furthermore, its calibrated set prediction is competitively efficient to other CP methods, while providing interpretable predictions of coherent sets along its hierarchical explanation.

Abstract: Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have revealed that large language models (LLMs) develop internal representations corresponding not only to concrete entities but also distinct, human-understandable abstract concepts and behaviour. Moreover, these hidden features can be directly manipulated to steer model behaviour. However, it remains an open question whether this phenomenon is unique to models trained on inherently structured data (ie. language, images) or if it is a general property of foundation models. In this work, we investigate the internal representations of a large physics-focused foundation model. Inspired by recent work identifying single directions in activation space for complex behaviours in LLMs, we extract activation vectors from the model during forward passes over simulation datasets for different physical regimes. We then compute "delta" representations between the two regimes. These delta tensors act as concept directions in activation space, encoding specific physical features. By injecting these concept directions back into the model during inference, we can steer its predictions, demonstrating causal control over physical behaviours, such as inducing or removing some particular physical feature from a simulation. These results suggest that scientific foundation models learn generalised representations of physical principles. They do not merely rely on superficial correlations and patterns in the simulations. Our findings open new avenues for understanding and controlling scientific foundation models and has implications for AI-enabled scientific discovery.

Conclusion: 该方法为高风险人机交互场景中的实时安全监控提供了可推广的框架，具备良好的实用性与可靠性，适用于飞行测试等复杂动态系统。

Abstract: We develop a data-driven approach for runtime safety monitoring in flight testing, where pilots perform maneuvers on aircraft with uncertain parameters. Because safety violations can arise unexpectedly as a result of these uncertainties, pilots need clear, preemptive criteria to abort the maneuver in advance of safety violation. To solve this problem, we use offline stochastic trajectory simulation to learn a calibrated statistical model of the short-term safety risk facing pilots. We use flight testing as a motivating example for data-driven learning/monitoring of safety due to its inherent safety risk, uncertainty, and human-interaction. However, our approach consists of three broadly-applicable components: a model to predict future state from recent observations, a nearest neighbor model to classify the safety of the predicted state, and classifier calibration via conformal prediction. We evaluate our method on a flight dynamics model with uncertain parameters, demonstrating its ability to reliably identify unsafe scenarios, match theoretical guarantees, and outperform baseline approaches in preemptive classification of risk.

Abstract: We present Primal, a deterministic feature mapping framework that harnesses the number-theoretic independence of prime square roots to construct robust, tunable vector representations. Diverging from standard stochastic projections (e.g., Random Fourier Features), our method exploits the Besicovitch property to create irrational frequency modulations that guarantee infinite non-repeating phase trajectories. We formalize two distinct algorithmic variants: (1) StaticPrime, a sequence generation method that produces temporal position encodings empirically approaching the theoretical Welch bound for quasi-orthogonality; and (2) DynamicPrime, a tunable projection layer for input-dependent feature mapping. A central novelty of the dynamic framework is its ability to unify two disparate mathematical utility classes through a single scaling parameter σ. In the low-frequency regime, the method acts as an isometric kernel map, effectively linearizing non-convex geometries (e.g., spirals) to enable high-fidelity signal reconstruction and compressive sensing. Conversely, the high-frequency regime induces chaotic phase wrapping, transforming the projection into a maximum-entropy one-way hash suitable for Hyperdimensional Computing and privacy-preserving Split Learning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our framework yields superior orthogonality retention and distribution tightness compared to normalized Gaussian baselines, establishing it as a computationally efficient, mathematically rigorous alternative to random matrix projections.

*Nan Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究复杂模拟器中状态重置的挑战，提出在仅能通过采样访问模拟器的情况下选择最优信念状态近似方法的问题。作者将该问题转化为一个通用的条件分布选择任务，并提出了两种不同的形式化：基于潜在状态的选择和基于观测的选择。研究表明，这两种形式在不同回放策略下的表现差异显著，尤其是在单次重置（Single-Reset）与重复重置（Repeated-Reset）策略下，其理论保证存在根本性区别。文章揭示了该看似简单问题背后的丰富算法选择、理论细节和未解问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态重置是支持样本规划和真实数据校准的关键能力，但在具有潜在变量的复杂模拟器中，实现状态重置需从后验分布中采样信念状态，而精确采样通常不可行。因此需要一种在仅有采样访问条件下选择最佳近似信念状态的方法。

Method: 将信念状态选择问题建模为一个条件分布选择任务，提出基于采样访问的新型算法；分析了两种形式化方式——潜状态导向与观测导向——在不同回放策略下的有效性与理论保证。

Result: 证明了观察导向选择在单次重置下可能失效，但在重复重置下可提供理论保障；揭示了不同算法设计与下游使用策略之间的深层依赖关系，强调了分布偏移和采样策略选择的重要性。

Conclusion: 状态重置问题远比表面复杂，其有效解决依赖于对信念状态选择形式、回放策略及采样机制的深刻理解，本文为此提供了理论框架与新视角，也指出了多个开放性问题。

Abstract: State resetting is a fundamental but often overlooked capability of simulators. It supports sample-based planning by allowing resets to previously encountered simulation states, and enables calibration of simulators using real data by resetting to states observed in real-system traces. While often taken for granted, state resetting in complex simulators can be nontrivial: when the simulator comes with latent variables (states), state resetting requires sampling from the posterior over the latent state given the observable history, a.k.a. the belief state (Silver and Veness, 2010). While exact sampling is often infeasible, many approximate belief-state samplers can be constructed, raising the question of how to select among them using only sampling access to the simulator.
  In this paper, we show that this problem reduces to a general conditional distribution-selection task and develop a new algorithm and analysis under sampling-only access. Building on this reduction, the belief-state selection problem admits two different formulations: latent state-based selection, which directly targets the conditional distribution of the latent state, and observation-based selection, which targets the induced distribution over the observation. Interestingly, these formulations differ in how their guarantees interact with the downstream roll-out methods: perhaps surprisingly, observation-based selection may fail under the most natural roll-out method (which we call Single-Reset) but enjoys guarantees under the less conventional alternative (which we call Repeated-Reset). Together with discussion on issues such as distribution shift and the choice of sampling policies, our paper reveals a rich landscape of algorithmic choices, theoretical nuances, and open questions, in this seemingly simple problem.

Motivation: 在在线学习场景中，传统确定性哈希嵌入对类别到达顺序敏感并容易产生遗忘现象，导致性能下降；而现有方法多针对离线或批量设置，难以适应持续变化的分类特征词汇。因此需要一种能适应动态词汇、保持历史信息、内存高效且对顺序不敏感的在线嵌入方法。

Method: 提出概率哈希嵌入（PHE）模型，将哈希嵌入视为随机变量，采用贝叶斯在线学习框架进行增量更新。设计可扩展的推断算法，用于学习模型参数并更新哈希嵌入及其他潜在变量的后验分布。

Result: PHE在分类、序列建模和推荐系统等在线任务中均表现出优越性能，相比基线方法显著提升准确率与稳定性；同时内存消耗仅为独热编码表的2~4倍，具备高度可扩展性。

Conclusion: PHE有效解决了在线学习中动态分类特征嵌入的挑战，兼具适应性、记忆保持性、低内存开销和顺序无关性，是一种适用于大规模流数据的先进嵌入方法。

Abstract: We study streaming data with categorical features where the vocabulary of categorical feature values is changing and can even grow unboundedly over time. Feature hashing is commonly used as a pre-processing step to map these categorical values into a feature space of fixed size before learning their embeddings. While these methods have been developed and evaluated for offline or batch settings, in this paper we consider online settings. We show that deterministic embeddings are sensitive to the arrival order of categories and suffer from forgetting in online learning, leading to performance deterioration. To mitigate this issue, we propose a probabilistic hash embedding (PHE) model that treats hash embeddings as stochastic and applies Bayesian online learning to learn incrementally from data. Based on the structure of PHE, we derive a scalable inference algorithm to learn model parameters and infer/update the posteriors of hash embeddings and other latent variables. Our algorithm (i) can handle an evolving vocabulary of categorical items, (ii) is adaptive to new items without forgetting old items, (iii) is implementable with a bounded set of parameters that does not grow with the number of distinct observed values on the stream, and (iv) is invariant to the item arrival order. Experiments in classification, sequence modeling, and recommendation systems in online learning setups demonstrate the superior performance of PHE while maintaining high memory efficiency (consumes as low as 2~4 memory of a one-hot embedding table).

*Anil K. Saini,Jose Guadalupe Hernandez,Emily F. Wong,Debanshi Misra,Jason H. Moore*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文比较了三种生成样本权重的方法：使用遗传算法（GA）演化权重、仅基于数据集特征计算权重，以及对所有数据点分配相等权重。通过在11个公开数据集上的实验，发现演化权重能实现更好的公平性与预测性能之间的权衡，尤其当优化目标为准确率和人口均等差异时效果更显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在真实世界数据上训练时可能产生偏向性预测，从而对边缘化群体造成负面影响。重加权是一种缓解此类偏差的方法，通过为每个训练数据点分配权重来实现。本文旨在探索不同权重生成策略对模型公平性与性能的影响。

Method: 采用遗传算法（GA）演化样本权重，对比基于数据集特征的权重计算方法和均匀权重策略；使用准确率、AUC、人口均等差异和子组假阴性公平性作为评价指标，并将这些指标作为GA的优化目标。

Result: 演化权重在多数数据集上优于其他方法，在准确率与人口均等差异联合优化时表现最佳；但收益大小高度依赖于所选优化目标。

Conclusion: 通过遗传算法演化样本权重可有效提升模型在公平性与预测性能之间的平衡，尤其在以准确率和人口均等差异为优化目标时效果最为突出。

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on real-world data may inadvertently make biased predictions that negatively impact marginalized communities. Reweighting is a method that can mitigate such bias in model predictions by assigning a weight to each data point used during model training. In this paper, we compare three methods for generating these weights: (1) evolving them using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), (2) computing them using only dataset characteristics, and (3) assigning equal weights to all data points. Model performance under each strategy was evaluated using paired predictive and fairness metrics, which also served as optimization objectives for the GA during evolution. Specifically, we used two predictive metrics (accuracy and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and two fairness metrics (demographic parity difference and subgroup false negative fairness). Using experiments on eleven publicly available datasets (including two medical datasets), we show that evolved sample weights can produce models that achieve better trade-offs between fairness and predictive performance than alternative weighting methods. However, the magnitude of these benefits depends strongly on the choice of optimization objectives. Our experiments reveal that optimizing with accuracy and demographic parity difference metrics yields the largest number of datasets for which evolved weights are significantly better than other weighting strategies in optimizing both objectives.

*Yingchuan Sun,Shengpu Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究通过在相同离线强化学习流程下，对四种不同时间步长（Δt=1,2,4,8小时）进行实证比较，探讨了时间步长对脓毒症管理中强化学习性能的影响。研究设计了动作重映射方法以实现跨时间步长的公平评估，并在两种策略学习设置下进行了跨Δt的模型选择。结果表明，随着学习设置的变化，性能趋势也随之变化；使用静态行为策略在更细粒度的时间步长（1小时和2小时）下训练的策略表现出最佳的整体性能与稳定性。该研究强调了时间步长是医疗领域离线强化学习中的核心设计选择，并为超越传统4小时设定提供了实证支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脓毒症管理的强化学习研究多采用4小时时间步长，但该时间步长的粗粒度可能扭曲患者动态并导致次优治疗策略。尽管已有担忧，但其实际影响尚未被充分探索，因此需要系统性地评估不同时间步长对学习效果的影响。

Method: 采用统一的离线强化学习流程，在Δt=1、2、4、8小时四种时间步长下进行实验；设计动作重映射方法以确保跨时间步长的公平评估；在两种策略学习设置下进行跨Δt模型选择；分析时间步长对状态表示学习、行为克隆、策略训练和离线评估的影响。

Result: 性能趋势随学习设置而变化；在较细时间步长（1小时和2小时）下，使用静态行为策略训练的策略表现最优，具有更高的性能和稳定性。

Conclusion: 时间步长是离线强化学习在医疗应用中的关键设计因素，研究结果支持采用小于4小时的时间步长，以更准确捕捉患者动态，提升治疗策略质量。

Abstract: Existing studies on reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis management have mostly followed an established problem setup, in which patient data are aggregated into 4-hour time steps. Although concerns have been raised regarding the coarseness of this time-step size, which might distort patient dynamics and lead to suboptimal treatment policies, the extent to which this is a problem in practice remains unexplored. In this work, we conducted empirical experiments for a controlled comparison of four time-step sizes ($Δt\!=\!1,2,4,8$ h) on this domain, following an identical offline RL pipeline. To enable a fair comparison across time-step sizes, we designed action re-mapping methods that allow for evaluation of policies on datasets with different time-step sizes, and conducted cross-$Δt$ model selections under two policy learning setups. Our goal was to quantify how time-step size influences state representation learning, behavior cloning, policy training, and off-policy evaluation. Our results show that performance trends across $Δt$ vary as learning setups change, while policies learned at finer time-step sizes ($Δt = 1$ h and $2$ h) using a static behavior policy achieve the overall best performance and stability. Our work highlights time-step size as a core design choice in offline RL for healthcare and provides evidence supporting alternatives beyond the conventional 4-hour setup.

### [129] [Operationalizing Quantized Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20927)
*Vitoria Barin-Pacela,Kartik Ahuja,Simon Lacoste-Julien,Pascal Vincent*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Cliff的新方法，通过鼓励潜在因子密度中沿轴对齐的不连续性（即'悬崖'）来实现无监督解缠。该方法基于理论假设：量化阈值对应于潜在因子概率密度中的轴对齐不连续点，并通过确保各因子的悬崖位置独立于其他因子的取值，实现了有效的无监督解缠。实验表明，Cliff在所有基准测试中均优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无监督解缠方法在非线性映射下难以有效识别量化因子，尽管理论已证明在任意微分同胚下量化因子具有可识别性，但如何将这一理论转化为实用且有效的准则仍具挑战。因此，需要一种能够自动捕捉轴对齐不连续性的机制，以实现鲁棒的无监督解缠。

Method: 提出基于'悬崖'（cliffs）的判别准则，即通过估计潜在因子的概率密度并检测其中的尖锐变化点，定义为悬崖。进一步约束这些悬崖的位置仅依赖于当前因子本身，而与其它因子的值无关，从而满足独立不连续性的理论要求。该方法通过优化损失函数来引导模型学习这种结构。

Result: Cliff在多个标准的无监督解缠基准测试中均取得了优于现有方法的表现，验证了其在复杂非线性场景下的有效性与鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的Cliff方法成功将理论上的轴对齐不连续性原则转化为可训练的实践准则，显著提升了无监督解缠性能，为未来自监督和无监督表示学习提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Recent theoretical work established the unsupervised identifiability of quantized factors under any diffeomorphism. The theory assumes that quantization thresholds correspond to axis-aligned discontinuities in the probability density of the latent factors. By constraining a learned map to have a density with axis-aligned discontinuities, we can recover the quantization of the factors. However, translating this high-level principle into an effective practical criterion remains challenging, especially under nonlinear maps. Here, we develop a criterion for unsupervised disentanglement by encouraging axis-aligned discontinuities. Discontinuities manifest as sharp changes in the estimated density of factors and form what we call cliffs. Following the definition of independent discontinuities from the theory, we encourage the location of the cliffs along a factor to be independent of the values of the other factors. We show that our method, Cliff, outperforms the baselines on all disentanglement benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in unsupervised disentanglement.

*Yaw Osei Adjei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了两种检测商业邮件诈骗（BEC）的范式：基于心理语言学的CatBoost模型和基于语义理解的DistilBERT深度学习模型。前者具有高可解释性和低延迟，后者在GPU支持下实现近乎完美的检测性能（AUC=1.0000，F1=0.9981），但计算成本较高。实验表明，两者在优化后均能实现超过99.96%的投资回报率，显著降低误漏报导致的财务损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BEC造成巨大经济损失，且误报（假阳性）与漏报（假阴性）的成本差异巨大，因此需要高效、准确且成本可控的检测方法，以最小化财务风险并优化资源使用。

Method: 采用CatBoost分析心理语言学特征，利用DistilBERT进行上下文语义理解；通过黑洞协议生成对抗性污染数据集（N=7,990），在Tesla T4 GPU上进行评估，对比两种模型的性能与效率。

Result: DistilBERT在对抗性数据集上达到AUC=1.0000、F1=0.9981，延迟为7.403毫秒；CatBoost实现AUC=0.9905、F1=0.9486，延迟仅0.885毫秒，计算开销极低。两者均具备高投资回报率，适合不同部署场景。

Conclusion: 对于具备GPU资源的组织，推荐使用DistilBERT以获得最高检测精度；而对边缘部署或成本敏感环境，CatBoost更具优势，兼具良好安全性和极低运营成本。两种方法在成本敏感学习优化下均可实现超过99.96%的投资回报率。

Abstract: Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a sophisticated social engineering threat that manipulates organizational hierarchies and exploits psychological vulnerabilities, leading to significant financial damage. According to the 2024 FBI Internet Crime Report, BEC accounts for over $2.9 billion in annual adjusted losses, presenting significant economic asymmetry: the cost of a False Negative (fraud loss) exceeds the cost of a False Positive (manual review) by orders of magnitude (approximately 1 to 5,480).
  This paper examines two detection paradigms for BEC: the Forensic Psycholinguistic Stream, which utilizes CatBoost to analyze psycholinguistic cues with high interpretability and low latency, and the Semantic Stream, which employs DistilBERT for deep learning-based contextual language understanding, offering superior accuracy at higher computational cost. We evaluated DistilBERT on an adversarially poisoned dataset (N = 7,990) generated via our Black Hole protocol, benchmarked on Tesla T4 GPU infrastructure, achieving superior detection (AUC = 1.0000, F1 = 0.9981) with acceptable real-time latency (7.403 milliseconds). CatBoost achieves competitive detection (AUC = 0.9905, F1 = 0.9486) at 8.4x lower latency (0.885 milliseconds), consuming negligible computational resources. For organizations with GPU infrastructure, DistilBERT offers superior accuracy. CatBoost is preferable for edge deployments or cost-sensitive environments due to comparable security and lower operational costs. Both approaches demonstrate return on investment exceeding 99.96% when optimized through cost-sensitive learning, by significantly reducing false negatives and associated financial losses.

TL;DR: 提出SGA-ACR框架，通过引入环境特定的子目标图和多LLM规划管道，分离生成、批判与优化过程，提升子目标的可执行性与可靠性，并利用子目标跟踪器动态更新图结构以保持计划与执行对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在强化学习中虽具备强大高层规划能力，但其规划与执行之间存在严重对齐问题，主要源于子目标缺乏环境具体知识支撑以及单一模型在生成与自验证中混杂导致的不可靠性。

Method: 设计多LLM规划流水线，分离生成、批判与精炼阶段；结合环境特定子目标图与结构化实体知识；引入子目标跟踪器进行执行监控、辅助奖励反馈及图结构动态更新。

Result: 在开放世界游戏Crafter的22个多样化任务上，实验验证了该方法在提升子目标可执行性与整体任务成功率方面的有效性。

Conclusion: SGA-ACR通过解耦规划流程并增强环境感知，显著改善了大语言模型在强化学习中的规划-执行对齐问题，为构建可靠自主智能体提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer strong high-level planning capabilities for reinforcement learning (RL) by decomposing tasks into subgoals. However, their practical utility is limited by poor planning-execution alignment, which reflects a critical gap between abstract plans and actionable, environment-compatible behaviors. This misalignment arises from two interrelated limitations: (1) LLMs often produce subgoals that are semantically plausible but infeasible or irrelevant in the target environment due to insufficient grounding in environment-specific knowledge, and (2) single-LLM planning conflates generation with self-verification, resulting in overconfident yet unreliable subgoals that frequently fail during execution. To address these challenges, we propose Subgoal Graph-Augmented Actor-Critic-Refiner (SGA-ACR), a framework that integrates an environment-specific subgoal graph and structured entity knowledge with a multi-LLM planning pipeline that explicitly separates generation, critique, and refinement to produce executable and verifiable subgoals. A subgoal tracker further monitors execution progress, provides auxiliary rewards, and adaptively updates the subgoal graph to maintain alignment between plans and actions. Experimental results on 22 diverse tasks in the open-world game "Crafter" demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Conclusion: FANoise通过理论驱动的动态噪声注入机制，有效平衡了噪声的利弊，为构建更鲁棒的表示学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Representation learning is fundamental to modern machine learning, powering applications such as text retrieval and multimodal understanding. However, learning robust and generalizable representations remains challenging. While prior work has demonstrated that active noise injection, a form of data augmentation, can enhance encoding performance, most existing methods rely on heuristic or static noise, overlooking the dynamic nature of feature distributions during training. In this work, we systematically study the role of noise in representation learning from both gradient-based and feature distribution perspectives, using InfoNCE loss as a representative example. Focusing on multimodal representation learning, we propose FANoise, a novel feature-adaptive noise injection strategy. By leveraging the dynamics of contrastive learning, FANoise effectively mitigates the negative impacts of noise while preserving its benefits. Under this theoretically grounded framework, comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FANoise consistently improves overall performance on multimodal tasks across various base VLM models.

Conclusion: 本文建立了伊辛模型在总变差距离下的统一估计框架，首次实现了对两类重要模型类别的多项式时间、最优样本复杂度估计，为结构学习提供了强有力的理论支持。

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating Ising models over $n$ variables in Total Variation (TV) distance, given $l$ independent samples from the model. While the statistical complexity of the problem is well-understood [DMR20], identifying computationally and statistically efficient algorithms has been challenging. In particular, remarkable progress has occurred in several settings, such as when the underlying graph is a tree [DP21, BGPV21], when the entries of the interaction matrix follow a Gaussian distribution [GM24, CK24], or when the bulk of its eigenvalues lie in a small interval [AJK+24, KLV24], but no unified framework for polynomial-time estimation in TV exists so far. Our main contribution is a unified analysis of the Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood Estimator (MPLE) for two general classes of Ising models. The first class includes models that have bounded operator norm and satisfy the Modified Log-Sobolev Inequality (MLSI), a functional inequality that was introduced to study the convergence of the associated Glauber dynamics to stationarity. In the second class of models, the interaction matrix has bounded infinity norm (or bounded width), which is the most common assumption in the literature for structure learning of Ising models. We show how our general results for these classes yield polynomial-time algorithms and optimal or near-optimal sample complexity guarantees in a variety of settings. Our proofs employ a variety of tools from tensorization inequalities to measure decompositions and concentration bounds.

Abstract: The challenge of separating AI-generated text from human-authored content is becoming more urgent as generative AI technologies like ChatGPT become more widely available. In this work, we address this issue by looking at both the detection of content that has been entirely generated by AI and the identification of human text that has been reworded by AI. In our work, a comprehensive methodology to detect AI- generated text using XLM-RoBERTa, a state-of-the-art multilingual transformer model. Our approach includes rigorous preprocessing, and feature extraction involving perplexity, semantic, and readability features. We fine-tuned the XLM-RoBERTa model on a balanced dataset of human and AI-generated texts and evaluated its performance. The model demonstrated high accuracy and robust performance across various text genres. Additionally, we conducted feature analysis to understand the model's decision-making process, revealing that perplexity and attention-based features are critical in differentiating between human and AI-generated texts. Our findings offer a valuable tool for maintaining academic integrity and contribute to the broader field of AI ethics by promoting transparency and accountability in AI systems. Future research directions include exploring other advanced models and expanding the dataset to enhance the model's generalizability.

Conclusion: 交错重置是一种简单而有效的技术，能有效缓解大规模并行强化学习中的非平稳性问题，提升训练稳定性和效率，尤其适用于高维度、高并行场景。

Abstract: Massively parallel GPU simulation environments have accelerated reinforcement learning (RL) research by enabling fast data collection for on-policy RL algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). To maximize throughput, it is common to use short rollouts per policy update, increasing the update-to-data (UTD) ra- tio. However, we find that, in this setting, standard synchronous resets introduce harmful nonstationarity, skewing the learning signal and destabilizing training. We introduce staggered resets, a simple yet effective technique where environments are initialized and reset at varied points within the task horizon. This yields training batches with greater temporal diversity, reducing the nonstationarity induced by synchronized rollouts. We characterize dimensions along which RL environments can benefit significantly from staggered resets through illustrative toy environ- ments. We then apply this technique to challenging high-dimensional robotics environments, achieving significantly higher sample efficiency, faster wall-clock convergence, and stronger final performance. Finally, this technique scales better with more parallel environments compared to naive synchronized rollouts.

Conclusion: ELBO$_\text{TDS}$有效缓解了时间分布偏移带来的挑战，为工业级推荐系统提供了可扩展、高效且稳定的增量学习方案。

Abstract: Temporal distribution shift (TDS) erodes the long-term accuracy of recommender systems, yet industrial practice still relies on periodic incremental training, which struggles to capture both stable and transient patterns. Existing approaches such as invariant learning and self-supervised learning offer partial solutions but often suffer from unstable temporal generalization, representation collapse, or inefficient data utilization. To address these limitations, we propose ELBO$_\text{TDS}$, a probabilistic framework that integrates seamlessly into industry-scale incremental learning pipelines. First, we identify key shifting factors through statistical analysis of real-world production data and design a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy that resamples these time-varying factors to extend the training support. Second, to harness the benefits of this extended distribution while preventing representation collapse, we model the temporal recommendation scenario using a causal graph and derive a self-supervised variational objective, ELBO$_\text{TDS}$, grounded in the causal structure. Extensive experiments supported by both theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrate that our method achieves superior temporal generalization, yielding a 2.33\% uplift in GMV per user and has been successfully deployed in Shopee Product Search.

Abstract: Dairy farmers should decide to keep or cull a cow based on an objective assessment of her likely performance in the herd. For this purpose, farmers need to identify more resilient cows, which can cope better with farm conditions and complete more lactations. This decision-making process is inherently complex, with significant environmental and economic implications. In this study, we develop an AI-driven model to predict cow longevity using historical multivariate time-series data recorded from birth. Leveraging advanced AI techniques, specifically Multi-Head Attention Transformers, we analysed approximately 780,000 records from 19,000 unique cows across 7 farms in Australia. The results demonstrate that our model achieves an overall determination coefficient of 83% in predicting herd life across the studied farms, highlighting its potential for practical application in dairy herd management.

Method: 提出 FedAPA 算法，采用自适应原型聚合（APA）策略，根据客户端间原型相似性动态分配权重，实现个性化全局原型；局部训练中融合分类损失与表示对比损失，增强知识对齐。

Result: 在六种真实环境、最多 20 人场景下，FedAPA 在准确率（+9.65%）、F1 分数（+9%）、MAE（-0.29）和通信开销（-95.94%）上均显著优于基线方法，验证了其有效性与实用性。

Conclusion: FedAPA 有效解决了异构数据与资源不均下的协同感知难题，具备高精度、低通信成本和个性化建模能力，适用于大规模部署的设备无关式无线感知系统。

Abstract: Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI)-based sensing provides a non-invasive, device-free approach for tasks such as human activity recognition and crowd counting, but large-scale deployment is hindered by the need for extensive site-specific training data. Federated learning (FL) offers a way to avoid raw data sharing but is challenged by heterogeneous sensing data and device resources. This paper proposes FedAPA, a collaborative Wi-Fi CSI-based sensing algorithm that uses adaptive prototype aggregation (APA) strategy to assign similarity-based weights to peer prototypes, enabling adaptive client contributions and yielding a personalized global prototype for each client instead of a fixed-weight aggregation. During local training, we adopt a hybrid objective that combines classification learning with representation contrastive learning to align local and global knowledge. We provide a convergence analysis of FedAPA and evaluate it in a real-world distributed Wi-Fi crowd counting scenario with six environments and up to 20 people. The results show that our method outperform multiple baselines in terms of accuracy, F1 score, mean absolute error (MAE), and communication overhead, with FedAPA achieving at least a 9.65% increase in accuracy, a 9% gain in F1 score, a 0.29 reduction in MAE, and a 95.94% reduction in communication overhead.

TL;DR: 本文首次对强化学习中可验证奖励（RLVR）的安全性进行了理论与实证分析。理论部分推导了在KL约束优化下安全偏差的上界，并证明了在特定条件下可消除安全退化；实证部分在五个对抗性安全基准上验证，RLVR可在提升推理能力的同时保持甚至增强安全防护。消融实验进一步考察了优化算法、模型规模和任务领域的影响。研究挑战了性能-安全权衡的普遍假设，表明特定训练方法可同时实现高性能与高安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型微调方法（如SFT和RLHF）在提升任务性能时往往导致安全性的下降，即使在良性数据集上也存在此问题。尽管强化学习中可验证奖励（RLVR）被提出作为更优替代方案，但其对安全性的潜在影响尚未被研究。因此亟需系统评估RLVR是否能在提升能力的同时保障安全。

Method: 结合理论推导与大规模实证实验：1）从理论上建立基于KL约束的优化框架，推导安全漂移的上界并给出避免安全退化的条件；2）设计多维度实验，覆盖五种对抗性安全基准，比较不同优化算法、模型规模及任务领域的表现；3）通过系统性消融分析揭示关键影响因素。

Result: 理论证明在特定条件下可完全避免安全退化；实证结果表明，相较于传统方法，RLVR在多个基准上同时实现了更强的推理能力与更高的安全性，且在不同模型规模和任务类型中表现出稳健性。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了强化学习中可验证奖励（RLVR）不仅能够有效提升模型能力，还能维持甚至增强安全性，打破了性能与安全之间不可调和的假定。这为构建具备强推理能力且安全可靠的大型语言模型提供了新的训练范式和实践指导。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks typically exhibit a fundamental safety-capability tradeoff, where improving task performance degrades safety alignment even on benign datasets. This degradation persists across standard approaches including supervised finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). While reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising alternative that optimizes models on objectively measurable tasks, its safety implications remain unexplored. We present the first comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis of safety properties in RLVR. Theoretically, we derive upper bounds on safety drift under KL-constrained optimization and prove conditions under which safety degradation is eliminated. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments across five adversarial safety benchmarks, demonstrating that RLVR can simultaneously enhance reasoning capabilities while maintaining or improving safety guardrails. Our comprehensive ablation studies examine the effects of optimization algorithms, model scale, and task domains. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption of an inevitable safety capability trade-off, and establish that a specific training methodology can achieve both objectives simultaneously, providing insights for the safe deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs.

### [140] [Efficient Diffusion Planning with Temporal Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21054)
*Jiaming Guo,Rui Zhang,Zerun Li,Yunkai Gao,Shaohui Peng,Siming Lan,Xing Hu,Zidong Du,Xishan Zhang,Ling Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Temporal Diffusion Planner (TDP) improves decision efficiency by distributing denoising steps across time, updating plans incrementally instead of generating new ones at each step. This reduces computational cost and increases decision frequency by 11–24.8 times while maintaining or improving performance on D4RL benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous diffusion planning methods generate new plans at every time step, leading to high computational overhead, low decision frequency, and potential performance degradation due to frequent plan switching. Inspired by human planning behavior—detailed short-term and vague long-term plans—TDP aims to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency.

Method: TDP generates an initial plan that gradually becomes more vague over time. At each time step, it updates the prior plan using a small number of denoising steps instead of full re-planning. An automated replanning mechanism is introduced to correct significant deviations from reality.

Result: On D4RL benchmarks, TDP achieves 11–24.8 times higher decision-making frequency compared to per-step re-planning methods, with equal or better performance.

Conclusion: TDP effectively enhances decision efficiency in diffusion-based offline planning by leveraging temporal continuity and incremental updates, enabling faster decision-making without sacrificing policy performance.

Abstract: Diffusion planning is a promising method for learning high-performance policies from offline data. To avoid the impact of discrepancies between planning and reality on performance, previous works generate new plans at each time step. However, this incurs significant computational overhead and leads to lower decision frequencies, and frequent plan switching may also affect performance. In contrast, humans might create detailed short-term plans and more general, sometimes vague, long-term plans, and adjust them over time. Inspired by this, we propose the Temporal Diffusion Planner (TDP) which improves decision efficiency by distributing the denoising steps across the time dimension. TDP begins by generating an initial plan that becomes progressively more vague over time. At each subsequent time step, rather than generating an entirely new plan, TDP updates the previous one with a small number of denoising steps. This reduces the average number of denoising steps, improving decision efficiency. Additionally, we introduce an automated replanning mechanism to prevent significant deviations between the plan and reality. Experiments on D4RL show that, compared to previous works that generate new plans every time step, TDP improves the decision-making frequency by 11-24.8 times while achieving higher or comparable performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在数据质量和模型适应性上存在不足，亟需一种系统性框架来优化离线数据选择与在线自修正生成过程，以提升大语言模型在下游任务中的表现。

Method: 采用双层数据选择进行离线数据筛选，基于验证集优化数据权重；在线自修正生成则被视为选择最适配验证数据的模型。通过学习每个问答对的权重，实现对数据质量的动态优化。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在质量增强和安全敏感的微调任务中均取得显著性能提升，理论分析也验证了其有效性，优于未经过滤的直接混合基线方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的框架为离线数据选择与在线自修正生成提供了统一的优化视角，通过学习数据权重显著提升了模型微调效果，具有理论支持与实际应用价值。

Abstract: Offline data selection and online self-refining generation, which enhance the data quality, are crucial steps in adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific downstream tasks. We tackle offline data selection and online self-refining generations through an optimization perspective. Specifically, bilevel data selection is used for offline data selection with respect to the validation dataset, and we treat online self-refining generation as a model adaptation step of selecting the model trained on current responses that best fits the validation data. Our framework offers a unified understanding of offline data selection and self-refining generation by assigning a learned data weight to each question and response, either explicitly or implicitly. For the first time, we theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of the bilevel data selection framework and demonstrate its performance gains over unfiltered direct mixing baselines. By combining offline data with validation-weighted online generations, our method enhances fine-tuning performance. Experiments on quality enhancement and safety-aware LLM fine-tuning validate its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BFT的高效后训练方法，用于在稀疏生物医学数据上学习复杂推理，无需外部奖励信号。通过双层加权机制（词级和样本级）提升模型性能，在医疗与生物任务中均优于SFT和现有基线，且生成的文本嵌入可直接应用于下游任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生物医学领域中，大语言模型的监督微调（SFT）容易过拟合表面模式，而强化学习因缺乏可行的奖励信号（如湿实验验证）难以应用。因此需要一种能从稀疏数据中有效学习复杂推理的新方法。

Method: BFT采用两层加权机制：1. 词级通过预测概率缩放损失以稳定梯度；2. 样本级使用‘最小组置信度’自适应增强难样本的学习。

Result: BFT在医疗任务中使LLM获取了SFT遗漏的知识，在生物任务中表现超过GeneAgent；其生成的文本嵌入可用于基因互作、单细胞扰动响应等下游任务，展现出广泛应用潜力。

Conclusion: BFT是一种高效且实用的后训练方法，显著提升了大语言模型在生物医学领域的推理能力，推动了LLMs在生命科学研究中的落地应用。

Abstract: Effective post-training is essential to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with specialized biomedical knowledge to accelerate life science research. However, current approaches face significant limitations. First, biomedical reasoning involves intricate mechanisms often represented by sparse textual data. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to overfit to surface-level instruction patterns without effectively internalizing this fragmented scientific knowledge. Second, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is impractical for this domain, as defining meaningful rewards often necessitates prohibitive experimental validation (e.g., wet-lab verification of drug responses), rendering real-time feedback unfeasible. We propose Balanced Fine-Tuning (BFT), an efficient post-training method designed to learn complex reasoning from sparse data without external reward signals. BFT operates through a two-layer weighting mechanism: 1. At the token level, it scales loss via prediction probabilities to stabilize gradients and prevent overfitting; 2. At the sample level, it uses "minimum group confidence" to adaptively enhance the learning of hard samples. Experiments demonstrate that BFT significantly outperforms SFT. In medical tasks, it enables LLMs to acquire knowledge that SFT misses. In biological tasks, BFT-based LLMs surpass GeneAgent (an accurate agent for biology analysis) in biological process reasoning. Moreover, the text embeddings generated by BFT can be directly applied to downstream tasks, such as gene interaction and single-cell perturbation response prediction. These results indicate that BFT facilitates broad applications of LLMs in biomedical research.

*Aaditya L. Kachhadiya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Deceptron模块，通过双向学习和多种正则化技术提升逆问题求解效率；在热传导和阻尼振子问题中显著减少迭代次数，性能接近高斯-牛顿法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理科学中的逆问题通常在输入空间中病态，导致步长敏感性，需要更稳健的求解方法。

Method: 引入Deceptron模块，结合监督拟合、前向-反向一致性、谱惩罚、软偏差绑定和雅可比复合惩罚（JCP），利用JVP/VJP探测实现$J_g(f(x))\,J_f(x)\approx I$；求解时采用D-IPG算法，在输出空间进行梯度下降并回传至输入空间，使用与基线一致的回溯和停止规则。

Result: 在Heat-1D初始条件恢复和阻尼振子逆问题中，D-IPG相比投影梯度分别减少约20倍和2-3倍迭代次数，性能与高斯-牛顿法相当；诊断显示JCP有效降低复合误差并追踪迭代收益；初步构建的单尺度2D模型DeceptronNet(v0)在公平协议下实现快速收敛。

Conclusion: Deceptron及其衍生方法D-IPG在逆问题求解中展现出高效性和鲁棒性，尤其适用于病态逆问题，具备良好的扩展潜力。

Abstract: Inverse problems in the physical sciences are often ill-conditioned in input space, making progress step-size sensitive. We propose the Deceptron, a lightweight bidirectional module that learns a local inverse of a differentiable forward surrogate. Training combines a supervised fit, forward-reverse consistency, a lightweight spectral penalty, a soft bias tie, and a Jacobian Composition Penalty (JCP) that encourages $J_g(f(x))\,J_f(x)\!\approx\!I$ via JVP/VJP probes. At solve time, D-IPG (Deceptron Inverse-Preconditioned Gradient) takes a descent step in output space, pulls it back through $g$, and projects under the same backtracking and stopping rules as baselines. On Heat-1D initial-condition recovery and a Damped Oscillator inverse problem, D-IPG reaches a fixed normalized tolerance with $\sim$20$\times$ fewer iterations on Heat and $\sim$2-3$\times$ fewer on Oscillator than projected gradient, competitive in iterations and cost with Gauss-Newton. Diagnostics show JCP reduces a measured composition error and tracks iteration gains. We also preview a single-scale 2D instantiation, DeceptronNet (v0), that learns few-step corrections under a strict fairness protocol and exhibits notably fast convergence.

Motivation: 传统神经影像学研究常因样本量小而难以保证结果的可靠性；现有元分析方法依赖关键词检索或线性映射，忽视了大脑内在的层次结构。因此需要一种能够建模复杂层次关系并融合文本与脑图像信息的新方法。

Method: 提出基于洛伦兹模型的双曲空间嵌入框架，将科研文献文本与对应的脑激活图映射到同一双曲空间中，利用双曲几何的自然层次表达能力，实现：1）脑与文本嵌入对齐以建立语义对应；2）引导文本与脑激活之间的层次关系；3）保持脑激活模式内部的层次结构。

Conclusion: 本研究证明了双曲几何在神经影像元分析中的有效性，提出了一种新颖且鲁棒的脑-文联合表示学习框架，为未来跨模态、多层次的神经科学研究提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Various neuroimaging studies suffer from small sample size problem which often limit their reliability. Meta-analysis addresses this challenge by aggregating findings from different studies to identify consistent patterns of brain activity. However, traditional approaches based on keyword retrieval or linear mappings often overlook the rich hierarchical structure in the brain. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic geometry to bridge the gap between neuroscience literature and brain activation maps. By embedding text from research articles and corresponding brain images into a shared hyperbolic space via the Lorentz model, our method captures both semantic similarity and hierarchical organization inherent in neuroimaging data. In the hyperbolic space, our method performs multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis (MNM) by 1) aligning brain and text embeddings for semantic correspondence, 2) guiding hierarchy between text and brain activations, and 3) preserving the hierarchical relationships within brain activation patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines, offering a robust and interpretable paradigm of multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis via hyperbolic brain-text representation.

Motivation: 传统ESR系统采用用户-物品解耦方法，虽高效但难以捕捉细粒度用户-物品亲和力和跨信号，限制了排序效果。

Result: 在主流指标、用户参与度及消费任务上均有显著提升，成功实现大规模目标感知注意力建模的部署。

Conclusion: GESR范式有效弥合了早期阶段排序中的有效性与效率之间的差距，为大规模推荐系统提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Large-scale recommendations commonly adopt a multi-stage cascading ranking system paradigm to balance effectiveness and efficiency. Early Stage Ranking (ESR) systems utilize the "user-item decoupling" approach, where independently learned user and item representations are only combined at the final layer. While efficient, this design is limited in effectiveness, as it struggles to capture fine-grained user-item affinities and cross-signals. To address these, we propose the Generative Early Stage Ranking (GESR) paradigm, introducing the Mixture of Attention (MoA) module which leverages diverse attention mechanisms to bridge the effectiveness gap: the Hard Matching Attention (HMA) module encodes explicit cross-signals by computing raw match counts between user and item features; the Target-Aware Self Attention module generates target-aware user representations conditioned on the item, enabling more personalized learning; and the Cross Attention modules facilitate early and more enriched interactions between user-item features. MoA's specialized attention encodings are further refined in the final layer through a Multi-Logit Parameterized Gating (MLPG) module, which integrates the newly learned embeddings via gating and produces secondary logits that are fused with the primary logit. To address the efficiency and latency challenges, we have introduced a comprehensive suite of optimization techniques. These span from custom kernels that maximize the capabilities of the latest hardware to efficient serving solutions powered by caching mechanisms. The proposed GESR paradigm has shown substantial improvements in topline metrics, engagement, and consumption tasks, as validated by both offline and online experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first successful deployment of full target-aware attention sequence modeling within an ESR stage at such a scale.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Explore-Then-Exploit（ETE）的训练无关解码策略，以解决扩散语言模型（DLMs）在依赖高置信度词时存在的信息瓶颈问题。研究揭示了仅依赖高概率词会限制每轮解码的有效进展，并理论证明了解码轮数与样本总信息量成正比、与每轮信息预算成反比，即‘比特-轮次’原则。ETE通过跨块解码和对高不确定性词的定向探索，重塑条件分布并引发一系列确定性预测，显著减少解码轮数，同时保持生成质量。实验验证了理论边界，并表明ETE优于仅基于置信度的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准扩散语言模型解码策略依赖高置信度词，但这些词携带的信息量极低，导致解码效率受限，存在信息论上的固有瓶颈，亟需更高效的解码机制。

Method: 提出并分析了‘比特-轮次’原则，设计训练免费的Explore-Then-Exploit（ETE）解码策略，结合跨块解码与高不确定性词的定向探索，以最大化信息吞吐量和解码效率。

Result: 实验结果验证了理论推导的边界，表明ETE在不牺牲生成质量的前提下，显著减少了所需解码轮数，优于仅依赖置信度的基线方法。

Conclusion: 仅依赖高置信度词的解码策略在信息论上是低效的；通过引入探索机制的ETE策略可有效突破信息瓶颈，实现更高效、更快的扩散语言模型解码。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a strong alternative to autoregressive language models (LMs). DLMs offer comparable accuracy with faster inference speed via parallel decoding. However, standard DLM decoding strategies relying on high-confidence tokens encounter an inherent information-theoretic bottleneck that restricts decoding progress and ultimately slows generation. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that prioritizing high-confidence tokens is inherently inefficient. High-probability tokens carry negligible information and strictly relying on them limits the effective progress made in each decoding round. We prove that the number of decoding rounds must grow linearly with the sample's total information (negative log-likelihood) and inversely with the per-round information budget, establishing a bits-to-rounds principle. We also propose Explore-Then-Exploit (ETE), a training-free decoding strategy that maximizes information throughput and decoding efficiency. ETE combines cross-block decoding with targeted exploration of high-uncertainty tokens to reshape the conditional distribution and trigger cascades of confident predictions. Experiments verify our theoretical bounds and demonstrate that ETE consistently reduces the required number of decoding rounds compared to confidence-only baselines without compromising generation quality.

TL;DR: BRIDGE提出了一种结构化提示方法，通过将程序验证分解为代码、规格说明和证明三个相互关联的领域，实现可扩展的已验证程序生成。该方法通过激发功能、规格驱动和证明导向的推理行为作为中间表示，显著提升了在Lean4等交互式证明框架中的准确性和效率。实验表明，功能推理使形式语言中代码正确率提升近1.5倍（pass@5），且推理效率提高2倍；规格驱动提示使Python编码通过率最高提升17.5%。研究为后续基于专家迭代或强化学习的训练提供了基础，推动模型内化跨代码、规格与证明的推理策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在代码生成方面表现优异，但在程序验证特别是交互式证明框架（如Lean4）中存在可扩展性挑战，难以同时覆盖代码、规格说明和正确性证明三方面。缺乏对三者间结构化对齐的有效机制限制了可信合成的发展。

Method: BRIDGE采用结构化提示策略，将验证过程分解为三个核心域：代码（可执行实现）、规格说明（形式意图陈述）和证明（构造性正确性论证）。通过设计特定提示引导模型产生功能、规格驱动和证明导向的中间推理表示，保持语义一致性并连接各域。通过系统消融实验评估不同策略的效果。

Result: 功能推理使Lean4中代码正确率（pass@5）提升近1.5倍，推理效率提升2倍；规格驱动提示使Python编码通过率最高提升17.5%。结果表明，结构化领域对齐能有效提升生成质量与计算效率，为可信合成提供新路径。

Conclusion: BRIDGE是首个系统性研究结构化提示在可扩展已验证程序生成中的应用，揭示了多领域协同推理的重要性。其框架为未来模型训练（如专家迭代或RLVR）奠定基础，有助于模型内化跨代码、规格与证明的高级推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in code generation, yet struggle with program verification, especially in interactive proof frameworks such as Lean4. A central challenge is scalability: verified synthesis requires not just code, but also precise specifications and correctness proofs, and existing approaches rarely span all three domains. We present BRIDGE, the first systematic study of structured prompting for scalable verified program generation. BRIDGE decomposes verification into three interconnected domains: Code (executable implementations), Specifications (formal intent statements), and Proofs (constructive correctness arguments). Our key idea is to elicit distinct reasoning behaviors functional, specification-driven, and proof-oriented as intermediate representations that preserve semantic structure and connect these domains. Through systematic ablations, we show that this approach substantially improves both accuracy and efficiency beyond standard error feedback methods. For example, functional reasoning improves correctness of code in formal languages (Lean4) by nearly 1.5x (pass@5) over direct baselines. In inference-time compute, functional reasoning is also 2x more efficient, achieving higher pass rates with fewer generations and lower total sampling budgets. Similarly, we find that specification-driven prompting boosts Python coding pass rates by up to 17.5%. These findings suggest that structured domain alignment is a promising direction for advancing verified synthesis. BRIDGE establishes a foundation for training via expert iteration or RLVR, enabling models to internalize these reasoning strategies across code, specifications, and proofs.

Abstract: Fair clustering has gained increasing attention in recent years, especially in applications involving socially sensitive attributes. However, existing fair clustering methods often lack interpretability, limiting their applicability in high-stakes scenarios where understanding the rationale behind clustering decisions is essential. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing an interpretable and fair clustering framework, which integrates fairness constraints into the structure of decision trees. Our approach constructs interpretable decision trees that partition the data while ensuring fair treatment across protected groups. To further enhance the practicality of our framework, we also introduce a variant that requires no fairness hyperparameter tuning, achieved through post-pruning a tree constructed without fairness constraints. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method not only delivers competitive clustering performance and improved fairness, but also offers additional advantages such as interpretability and the ability to handle multiple sensitive attributes. These strengths enable our method to perform robustly under complex fairness constraints, opening new possibilities for equitable and transparent clustering.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is retracing the Internet's path from centralized provision to distributed creation. Initially, resource-intensive computation concentrates within institutions capable of training and serving large models.Eventually, as federated learning matures, billions of edge devices holding sensitive data will be able to collectively improve models without surrendering raw information, enabling both contribution and consumption at scale. This democratic vision remains unrealized due to certain compositional gaps; aggregators handle updates without accountability, economic mechanisms are lacking and even when present remain vulnerable to gaming, coordination serializes state modifications limiting scalability, and governance permits retroactive manipulation. This work addresses these gaps by leveraging cryptographic receipts to prove aggregation correctness, geometric novelty measurement to prevent incentive gaming, parallel object ownership to achieve linear scalability, and time-locked policies to check retroactive manipulation.

*Chungpa Lee,Thomas Zeng,Jongwon Jeong,Jy-yong Sohn,Kangwook Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种简单的插件框架，用于校正大型语言模型（LLM）评估中的偏差，并构建反映测试和校准数据集不确定性的置信区间，从而实现实用且统计上可靠的基于LLM的评估。此外，为减少准确性估计的不确定性，还引入了一种自适应算法，以高效分配校准样本量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为评估者虽具可扩展性，但其判断存在噪声，因模型特异性和敏感性不完美，导致准确性估计有偏。现有偏差校正方法通常假设已知精确的特异性和敏感性值，但在实际中仅能获得这些值的估计，且如何基于估计值正确构建置信区间尚不明确。

Method: 提出一种插件式偏差校正框架，结合测试与校准数据集的不确定性，构建置信区间；设计自适应算法，动态优化校准样本分配，以降低估计不确定性。

Result: 该框架有效纠正了基于LLM评估的偏差，生成更准确的置信区间，并通过自适应算法显著减少了估计的不确定性，提升了评估的可靠性与实用性。

Conclusion: 本研究为基于LLM的评估提供了统计严谨且实用的方法，解决了偏差校正与置信区间构建在现实条件下的挑战，推动了自动化评估的可信度发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in lieu of humans. While scalable, their judgments are noisy due to imperfect specificity and sensitivity of LLMs, leading to biased accuracy estimates. Although bias-correction methods exist, they are underutilized in LLM research and typically assume exact knowledge of the model's specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, in general we only have estimates of these values and it is not well known how to properly construct confidence intervals using only estimates. This work presents a simple plug-in framework that corrects such bias and constructs confidence intervals reflecting uncertainty from both test and calibration dataset, enabling practical and statistically sound LLM-based evaluation. Additionally, to reduce uncertainty in the accuracy estimate, we introduce an adaptive algorithm that efficiently allocates calibration sample sizes.

Conclusion: CHMR展示了层次感知与多模态学习在构建可靠且生物学可解释的分子表示方面的优势，为整合生物医学建模提供了一个通用且可推广的框架。

Abstract: Understanding how chemical perturbations propagate through biological systems is essential for robust molecular property prediction. While most existing methods focus on chemical structures alone, recent advances highlight the crucial role of cellular responses such as morphology and gene expression in shaping drug effects. However, current cell-aware approaches face two key limitations: (1) modality incompleteness in external biological data, and (2) insufficient modeling of hierarchical dependencies across molecular, cellular, and genomic levels. We propose CHMR (Cell-aware Hierarchical Multi-modal Representations), a robust framework that jointly models local-global dependencies between molecules and cellular responses and captures latent biological hierarchies via a novel tree-structured vector quantization module. Evaluated on nine public benchmarks spanning 728 tasks, CHMR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding average improvements of 3.6% on classification and 17.2% on regression tasks. These results demonstrate the advantage of hierarchy-aware, multimodal learning for reliable and biologically grounded molecular representations, offering a generalizable framework for integrative biomedical modeling.

Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has emerged as a critical tool for extracting fine-grained sentiment insights from user-generated content, particularly in e-commerce and social media domains. However, research on Bangla ABSA remains significantly underexplored due to the absence of comprehensive datasets and specialized frameworks for triplet extraction in this language. This paper introduces BanglaASTE, a novel framework for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) that simultaneously identifies aspect terms, opinion expressions, and sentiment polarities from Bangla product reviews. Our contributions include: (1) creation of the first annotated Bangla ASTE dataset containing 3,345 product reviews collected from major e-commerce platforms including Daraz, Facebook, and Rokomari; (2) development of a hybrid classification framework that employs graph-based aspect-opinion matching with semantic similarity techniques; and (3) implementation of an ensemble model combining BanglaBERT contextual embeddings with XGBoost boosting algorithms for enhanced triplet extraction performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our ensemble approach achieves superior performance with 89.9% accuracy and 89.1% F1-score, significantly outperforming baseline models across all evaluation metrics. The framework effectively addresses key challenges in Bangla text processing including informal expressions, spelling variations, and data sparsity. This research advances the state-of-the-art in low-resource language sentiment analysis and provides a scalable solution for Bangla e-commerce analytics applications.

Abstract: Accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction hinges on the quality of health indicators (HIs), yet existing methods often fail to disentangle complex degradation mechanisms in multi-sensor systems or quantify uncertainty in HI reliability. This paper introduces a novel framework for HI construction, advancing three key contributions. First, we adapt Reconstruction along Projected Pathways (RaPP) as a health indicator (HI) for RUL prediction for the first time, showing that it outperforms traditional reconstruction error metrics. Second, we show that augmenting RaPP-derived HIs with aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty quantification (UQ) via Monte Carlo dropout and probabilistic latent spaces- significantly improves RUL-prediction robustness. Third, and most critically, we propose indicator groups, a paradigm that isolates sensor subsets to model system-specific degradations, giving rise to our novel method, I-GLIDE which enables interpretable, mechanism-specific diagnostics. Evaluated on data sourced from aerospace and manufacturing systems, our approach achieves marked improvements in accuracy and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art HI methods while providing actionable insights into system failure pathways. This work bridges the gap between anomaly detection and prognostics, offering a principled framework for uncertainty-aware degradation modeling in complex systems.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient seismic response prediction is essential for the design of resilient structures. While the Finite Element Method (FEM) remains the standard for nonlinear seismic analysis, its high computational demands limit its scalability and real time applicability. Recent developments in deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models, have shown promise in reducing the computational cost of nonlinear seismic analysis of structures. However, these data driven models often struggle to generalize and capture the underlying physics, leading to reduced reliability. We propose a novel Physics Informed U Net LSTM framework that integrates physical laws with deep learning to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. By embedding domain specific constraints into the learning process, the proposed model achieves improved predictive performance over conventional Machine Learning architectures. This hybrid approach bridges the gap between purely data driven methods and physics based modeling, offering a robust and computationally efficient alternative for seismic response prediction of structures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了掩码扩散语言模型（MDLMs）在上下文理解方面的能力，发现其存在两个关键局限：一是尽管具有全局训练目标和双向注意力机制，但依然表现出强烈的局部性偏差，对信息位置敏感；二是生成时添加大量掩码会显著降低上下文理解能力，这些掩码充当干扰项。为此，作者提出一种无掩码损失函数，使模型预测对掩码数量不敏感，并通过微调显著缓解了掩码的干扰效应，提升了模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索并改进掩码扩散语言模型（MDLMs）在上下文理解上的局限性，以克服其与自回归语言模型类似的局部性偏差及生成过程中掩码带来的干扰问题。

Method: 通过系统消融实验分析掩码数量对上下文理解的影响，设计并引入一种新的掩码无关损失函数，用于训练模型减少对掩码数量的依赖。

Result: 新提出的掩码无关损失函数能有效减轻掩码的干扰作用，显著提升MDLMs在不同掩码配置下的上下文理解能力，增强模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 当前MDLM训练范式存在重要缺陷，需通过改进训练目标来增强其上下文理解能力，为构建更强大的基于扩散的语言模型提供可行路径。

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to Autoregressive Language Models (ARLMs), leveraging a denoising objective that, in principle, should enable more uniform context utilisation. In this work, we examine the context comprehension abilities of MDLMs and uncover two key limitations. First, despite their more global training objective and bidirectional attention mechanism, similarly to ARLMS, MDLMs exhibit a strong locality bias: performance is highly sensitive to the position of relevant information within the input, favouring local over distant context. Second, we show that appending a large number of mask tokens--required for generation--can significantly degrade context comprehension. Through systematic ablations, we find that these masks act as distractors, reducing the model's ability to process relevant information. To address this, we introduce a mask-agnostic loss function that encourages predictions to remain invariant to the number of appended masks. Fine-tuning with this objective substantially mitigates the distracting effect of masks, improving robustness of MDLMs. Overall, our findings reveal critical limitations of the current MDLM training paradigm and provide actionable insights for building diffusion-based language models with stronger context comprehension.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is increasingly adopted in scientific research, yet the quality and reliability of results often depend on how experiments are designed and documented.

This paper presents a practical and structured guide for conducting ML experiments in scientific applications, focussing on reproducibility, fair comparison, and transparent reporting. We outline a step-by-step workflow, from dataset preparation to model selection and evaluation, and propose metrics that account for overfitting and instability across validation folds, including the Logarithmic Overfitting Ratio (LOR) and the Composite Overfitting Score (COS). Through recommended practices and example reporting formats, this work aims to support researchers in establishing robust baselines and drawing valid evidence-based insights from ML models applied to scientific problems.

Conclusion: 将监督信号融入逆强化学习有助于提升模型在复杂真实场景中的性能，H-AIRL为应对挑战性任务提供了一个有前景的新框架。

Abstract: Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL) has shown promise in addressing the sparse reward problem in reinforcement learning (RL) by inferring dense reward functions from expert demonstrations. However, its performance in highly complex, imperfect-information settings remains largely unexplored. To explore this gap, we evaluate AIRL in the context of Heads-Up Limit Hold'em (HULHE) poker, a domain characterized by sparse, delayed rewards and significant uncertainty. In this setting, we find that AIRL struggles to infer a sufficiently informative reward function. To overcome this limitation, we contribute Hybrid-AIRL (H-AIRL), an extension that enhances reward inference and policy learning by incorporating a supervised loss derived from expert data and a stochastic regularization mechanism. We evaluate H-AIRL on a carefully selected set of Gymnasium benchmarks and the HULHE poker setting. Additionally, we analyze the learned reward function through visualization to gain deeper insights into the learning process. Our experimental results show that H-AIRL achieves higher sample efficiency and more stable learning compared to AIRL. This highlights the benefits of incorporating supervised signals into inverse RL and establishes H-AIRL as a promising framework for tackling challenging, real-world settings.

Result: DPC相比传统方法速度提升近十倍，消除随机性，结果确定且可复现；在多个数据集、模型和解释方法上表现稳定，能有效评估各类特征归因方法的保真度。

Conclusion: DPC是一种高效、确定、可复现的保真度评估方法，可替代或补充现有指标，尤其适用于对可靠性要求高的医疗等关键领域。

Abstract: The utility of an explanation method critically depends on its fidelity to the underlying machine learning model. Especially in high-stakes medical settings, clinicians and regulators require explanations that faithfully reflect the model's decision process. Existing fidelity metrics such as Infidelity rely on Monte Carlo approximation, which demands numerous model evaluations and introduces uncertainty due to random sampling. This work proposes a novel metric for evaluating the fidelity of local feature attribution methods by modifying the existing Prediction Change (PC) metric within the Guided Perturbation Experiment. By incorporating the direction of both perturbation and attribution, the proposed Directed Prediction Change (DPC) metric achieves an almost tenfold speedup and eliminates randomness, resulting in a deterministic and trustworthy evaluation procedure that measures the same property as local Infidelity. DPC is evaluated on two datasets (skin lesion images and financial tabular data), two black-box models, seven explanation algorithms, and a wide range of hyperparameters. Across $4\,744$ distinct explanations, the results demonstrate that DPC, together with PC, enables a holistic and computationally efficient evaluation of both baseline-oriented and local feature attribution methods, while providing deterministic and reproducible outcomes.

Abstract: Natural disasters remain a major challenge for Bangladesh, so real-time monitoring and quick response systems are essential. In this study, we present BanglaMM-Disaster, an end-to-end deep learning-based multimodal framework for disaster classification in Bangla, using both textual and visual data from social media. We constructed a new dataset of 5,037 Bangla social media posts, each consisting of a caption and a corresponding image, annotated into one of nine disaster-related categories. The proposed model integrates transformer-based text encoders, including BanglaBERT, mBERT, and XLM-RoBERTa, with CNN backbones such as ResNet50, DenseNet169, and MobileNetV2, to process the two modalities. Using early fusion, the best model achieves 83.76% accuracy. This surpasses the best text-only baseline by 3.84% and the image-only baseline by 16.91%. Our analysis also shows reduced misclassification across all classes, with noticeable improvements for ambiguous examples. This work fills a key gap in Bangla multimodal disaster analysis and demonstrates the benefits of combining multiple data types for real-time disaster response in low-resource settings.

### [162] [Controlling changes to attention logits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21377)
*Ben Anson,Laurence Aitchison*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出通过为查询和键权重分配依赖参数的学习率来控制logits的变化，从而解决Transformer模型训练中的权重不稳定问题。该方法在MLA设置下表现优于其他方法，且在多头注意力中性能可与QK归一化相媲美，同时避免了QK归一化的兼容性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 查询和键权重在训练过程中容易无限制增长，导致模型不稳定。虽然QK归一化能有效缓解此问题，但在MLA等不完全展开查询和键的架构中不可用，因此需要一种替代方案。

Method: 为查询和键权重设计参数依赖的学习率，以控制其对logits的影响，从而稳定训练过程。该方法无需额外计算开销，具有低成本优势。

Result: 该方法在MLA设置下显著提升性能，允许更高的基础学习率，并在多头注意力中达到与QK归一化相当的性能水平。

Conclusion: 通过参数依赖学习率控制logits变化是实现权重稳定的有效且高效的方法，尤其适用于QK归一化不可行的场景。

Abstract: Stability of neural network weights is critical when training transformer models. The query and key weights are particularly problematic, as they tend to grow large without any intervention. Applying normalization to queries and keys, known as `QK norm', fixes stability issues in practice, but is not always applicable. For example, QK norm is not compatible with Multi Latent Attention (MLA) because QK norm requires full materialization of queries and keys during inference, which is not done in MLA. In this paper we suggest that controlling the changes to logits is important for stability. We show that these changes are controllable by assigning parameter-dependent learning rates to the query and key weights. We find that our cheap intervention allows us to increase the base learning rate of the network, outperform other methods in the MLA setting, and achieve performance competitive with QK norm when using Multi-head Attention.

Conclusion: AAR为处理污染数据提供了高效、可靠的解决方案，显著增强了异常检测在安全、医疗等真实场景中的适用性。

Abstract: Handling contaminated data poses a critical challenge in anomaly detection, as traditional models assume training on purely normal data. Conventional methods mitigate contamination by relying on fixed contamination ratios, but discrepancies between assumed and actual ratios can severely degrade performance, especially in noisy environments where normal and abnormal data distributions overlap. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive and Aggressive Rejection (AAR), a novel method that dynamically excludes anomalies using a modified z-score and Gaussian mixture model-based thresholds. AAR effectively balances the trade-off between preserving normal data and excluding anomalies by integrating hard and soft rejection strategies. Extensive experiments on two image datasets and thirty tabular datasets demonstrate that AAR outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 0.041 AUROC. By providing a scalable and reliable solution, AAR enhances robustness against contaminated datasets, paving the way for broader real-world applications in domains such as security and healthcare.

### [164] [Ensemble Performance Through the Lens of Linear Independence of Classifier Votes in Data Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21465)
*Enes Bektas,Fazli Can*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了数据流中集成学习的集成规模与性能之间的关系，提出线性无关的分类器组合能最大化表示能力，并通过理论分析推导出实现特定概率线性无关所需的集成规模。实验验证了该理论在OzaBagging和GOOWE方法上的有效性，揭示了复杂加权策略下高多样性可能引发算法不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集成学习方法在增加分类器数量时虽可提升准确率，但过大的集成会导致计算效率下降和性能收益递减。因此需要理论指导以确定最优集成规模，避免资源浪费并提升稳定性。

Method: 基于几何模型分析分类器投票间的线性独立性，建立概率模型以预测达到线性无关所需集成规模；进一步推广至加权多数投票问题，构建理论框架解释集成规模与性能的权衡。

Result: 理论估计在真实与合成数据集上均有效，能准确识别OzaBagging的性能饱和点；对于GOOWE等复杂加权方法，发现高理论多样性反而导致算法不稳定。

Conclusion: 线性独立性是决定集成性能的关键因素，合理控制集成规模可提升效率与稳定性，本研究为集成学习中的规模设计提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Ensemble learning improves classification performance by combining multiple base classifiers. While increasing the number of classifiers generally enhances accuracy, excessively large ensembles can lead to computational inefficiency and diminishing returns. This paper investigates the relationship between ensemble size and performance through the lens of linear independence among classifier votes in data streams. We propose that ensembles composed of linearly independent classifiers maximize representational capacity, particularly under a geometric model. We then generalize the importance of linear independence to the weighted majority voting problem. By modeling the probability of achieving linear independence among classifier outputs, we derive a theoretical framework that explains the trade-off between ensemble size and accuracy. Our analysis leads to a theoretical estimate of the ensemble size required to achieve a user-specified probability of linear independence. We validate our theory through experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets using two ensemble methods, OzaBagging and GOOWE. Our results confirm that this theoretical estimate effectively identifies the point of performance saturation for robust ensembles like OzaBagging. Conversely, for complex weighting schemes like GOOWE, our framework reveals that high theoretical diversity can trigger algorithmic instability. Our implementation is publicly available to support reproducibility and future research.

*Wanli Zhong,Haibo Feng,Zirui Zhou,Hanyang Peng,Shiqi Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IntAttention 是首个无需微调的全整数注意力流水线，通过 IndexSoftmax 等技术消除 softmax 阶段的浮点转换开销，在保持高精度的同时实现最高 3.7 倍加速和 61% 能耗降低，显著提升边缘设备上 Transformer 模型的推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 INT8 量化虽加速了矩阵乘法，但 softmax 阶段因需频繁进行反量化-softmax-重量化操作，成为主要瓶颈，且破坏了端到端整数数据流，限制了边缘设备上的高效部署。

Method: 提出 IntAttention，采用 IndexSoftmax 在整数域内替代浮点指数运算，结合稀疏感知裁剪、32 项查表近似与直接整数归一化，实现全整数注意力计算，无须重新训练。

Result: 在 Armv8 CPU 上相比 FP16 基线实现最高 3.7 倍加速和 61% 能耗降低，比传统 INT8 注意力快 2.0 倍，同时保持与基线相当的高精度，适用于多种语言和视觉模型。

Conclusion: IntAttention 成功解决了边缘设备上 Transformer 推理中 softmax 的性能瓶颈，实现了高效、低功耗且无需重训练的整数化注意力计算，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Deploying Transformer models on edge devices is limited by latency and energy budgets. While INT8 quantization effectively accelerates the primary matrix multiplications, it exposes the softmax as the dominant bottleneck. This stage incurs a costly dequantize-softmax-requantize detour, which can account for up to 65% of total attention latency and disrupts the end-to-end integer dataflow critical for edge hardware efficiency. To address this limitation, we present IntAttention, the first fully integer, plug-and-play attention pipeline without retraining. At the core of our approach lies IndexSoftmax, a hardware-friendly operator that replaces floating-point exponentials entirely within the integer domain. IntAttention integrates sparsity-aware clipping, a 32-entry lookup-table approximation, and direct integer normalization, thereby eliminating all datatype conversion overhead. We evaluate IntAttention and demonstrate consistent and substantial gains. Our method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 61% energy reduction over FP16 baselines and 2.0x faster than conventional INT8 attention pipelines on Armv8 CPUs. These gains are achieved with high-fidelity accuracy comparable to baselines across diverse language and vision models, enabling practical and efficient Transformer inference on commodity edge devices. Code will be released in later version of this work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释性方法主要关注输入-输出归因，难以揭示Transformer模型内部决策机制；而时间序列分类中的Transformer模型复杂性高，理解其内部运作机制存在挑战，因此亟需更深入的机制可解释性分析方法。

Method: 采用激活修补、注意力显著性与稀疏自编码器等机制可解释性技术，针对时间序列专用Transformer模型进行系统性探查，分析注意力头与时间步的因果角色，构建内部信息传播的因果图，并挖掘潜在语义特征。

Result: 实验表明，特定注意力头和时间步对分类结果具有显著因果影响，成功构建了反映信息流动的因果图；稀疏自编码器有效识别出可解释的潜在特征，提升了对模型行为的理解。

Conclusion: 本研究不仅推动了Transformer模型在时间序列任务中的可解释性方法发展，还为理解其内部工作机制提供了新视角，有助于提升模型透明度与可信度。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have become state-of-the-art tools in various machine learning tasks, including time series classification, yet their complexity makes understanding their internal decision-making challenging. Existing explainability methods often focus on input-output attributions, leaving the internal mechanisms largely opaque. This paper addresses this gap by adapting various Mechanistic Interpretability techniques; activation patching, attention saliency, and sparse autoencoders, from NLP to transformer architectures designed explicitly for time series classification. We systematically probe the internal causal roles of individual attention heads and timesteps, revealing causal structures within these models. Through experimentation on a benchmark time series dataset, we construct causal graphs illustrating how information propagates internally, highlighting key attention heads and temporal positions driving correct classifications. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of sparse autoencoders for uncovering interpretable latent features. Our findings provide both methodological contributions to transformer interpretability and novel insights into the functional mechanics underlying transformer performance in time series classification tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实世界的数据（如气候数据）通常具有空间网格时间序列结构，其内在系统在时空上可能表现出相似性，但存在的差异往往包含重要信息，同时可能破坏假设平稳性或空间平移不变性的算法的稳定性、收敛性和可靠性。因此，需要研究因果图随时间或空间变化所蕴含的信息，以增强算法的鲁棒性与有效性。

Method: 提出指导原则以应对因果图变化分析中的核心挑战；通过在基于约束的因果发现方法中修改独立性检验层级，构建一个模块化、可扩展的框架，能够兼容多种现有因果发现算法，并支持从变点检测、聚类、独立性检验等方向进行扩展。

Result: 成功构建了一个高度模块化、易于扩展且广泛适用的因果发现框架，能有效处理非平稳数据中的因果图变化问题，兼容多种主流因果发现算法，显著提升算法在非平稳条件下的稳定性与可靠性，且便于理解模型限制与参数选择。

Conclusion: 该框架为处理空间-时间数据中的因果图动态变化提供了通用解决方案，具备良好的可扩展性与可解释性，适用于多种实际场景，未来将通过开源实现推动广泛应用。

Abstract: Real-world data, for example in climate applications, often consists of spatially gridded time series data or data with comparable structure. While the underlying system is often believed to behave similar at different points in space and time, those variations that do exist are twofold relevant: They often encode important information in and of themselves. And they may negatively affect the stability / convergence and reliability\Slash{}validity of results of algorithms assuming stationarity or space-translation invariance. We study the information encoded in changes of the causal graph, with stability in mind. An analysis of this general task identifies two core challenges. We develop guiding principles to overcome these challenges, and provide a framework realizing these principles by modifying constraint-based causal discovery approaches on the level of independence testing. This leads to an extremely modular, easily extensible and widely applicable framework. It can leverage existing constraint-based causal discovery methods (demonstrated on IID-algorithms PC, PC-stable, FCI and time series algorithms PCMCI, PCMCI+, LPCMCI) with little to no modification. The built-in modularity allows to systematically understand and improve upon an entire array of subproblems. By design, it can be extended by leveraging insights from change-point-detection, clustering, independence-testing and other well-studied related problems. The division into more accessible sub-problems also simplifies the understanding of fundamental limitations, hyperparameters controlling trade-offs and the statistical interpretation of results. An open-source implementation will be available soon.

Motivation: 环肽作为靶向胞内位点的候选药物具有潜力，但其细胞膜渗透性受限于缺乏公开数据和不确定性校准不足的问题。现有深度学习方法依赖大量数据，难以满足实际需求。因此，亟需一种数据效率高、能准确估计不确定性的轻量级方法。

Method: 提出MD-GAK核函数，融合化学意义的残基相似性与序列对齐，解耦局部匹配与间隙惩罚；引入变体PMD-GAK，加入三角形位置先验以提升性能；采用高斯过程作为预测模型，实现不确定性建模。

Conclusion: MD-GAK与PMD-GAK通过结合化学先验与简洁的核函数设计，实现了高效、准确的环肽渗透性预测，并在不确定性估计方面表现优异，为小样本场景下的分子性质预测提供了可靠新范式。

Abstract: Cyclic peptides are promising modalities for targeting intracellular sites; however, cell-membrane permeability remains a key bottleneck, exacerbated by limited public data and the need for well-calibrated uncertainty. Instead of relying on data-eager complex deep learning architecture, we propose a monomer-aware decoupled global alignment kernel (MD-GAK), which couples chemically meaningful residue-residue similarity with sequence alignment while decoupling local matches from gap penalties. MD-GAK is a relatively simple kernel. To further demonstrate the robustness of our framework, we also introduce a variant, PMD-GAK, which incorporates a triangular positional prior. As we will show in the experimental section, PMD-GAK can offer additional advantages over MD-GAK, particularly in reducing calibration errors. Since our focus is on uncertainty estimation, we use Gaussian Processes as the predictive model, as both MD-GAK and PMD-GAK can be directly applied within this framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through an extensive set of experiments, comparing our fully reproducible approach against state-of-the-art models, and show that it outperforms them across all metrics.

Conclusion: 大语言模型能够有效辅助知识工程师重构层次结构，使其更适合双曲嵌入，从而提升嵌入质量，并实现透明、可解释的自动化调整。

Abstract: Hyperbolic geometry is an effective geometry for embedding hierarchical data structures. Hyperbolic learning has therefore become increasingly prominent in machine learning applications where data is hierarchically organized or governed by hierarchical semantics, ranging from recommendation systems to computer vision. The quality of hyperbolic embeddings is tightly coupled to the structure of the input hierarchy, which is often derived from knowledge graphs or ontologies. Recent work has uncovered that for an optimal hyperbolic embedding, a high branching factor and single inheritance are key, while embedding algorithms are robust to imbalance and hierarchy size. To assist knowledge engineers in reorganizing hierarchical knowledge, this paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to automatically restructure hierarchies to meet these criteria. We propose a prompt-based approach to transform existing hierarchies using LLMs, guided by known desiderata for hyperbolic embeddings. Experiments on 16 diverse hierarchies show that LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently yield higher-quality hyperbolic embeddings across several standard embedding quality metrics. Moreover, we show how LLM-guided hierarchy restructuring enables explainable reorganizations, providing justifications to knowledge engineers.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative AI necessitates robust safety evaluations. However, current safety datasets are predominantly English-centric, failing to capture specific risks in non-English, socio-cultural contexts such as Korean, and are often limited to the text modality. To address this gap, we introduce AssurAI, a new quality-controlled Korean multimodal dataset for evaluating the safety of generative AI. First, we define a taxonomy of 35 distinct AI risk factors, adapted from established frameworks by a multidisciplinary expert group to cover both universal harms and relevance to the Korean socio-cultural context. Second, leveraging this taxonomy, we construct and release AssurAI, a large-scale Korean multimodal dataset comprising 11,480 instances across text, image, video, and audio. Third, we apply the rigorous quality control process used to ensure data integrity, featuring a two-phase construction (i.e., expert-led seeding and crowdsourced scaling), triple independent annotation, and an iterative expert red-teaming loop. Our pilot study validates AssurAI's effectiveness in assessing the safety of recent LLMs. We release AssurAI to the public to facilitate the development of safer and more reliable generative AI systems for the Korean community.

Abstract: Scientific reasoning through Large Language Models in heliophysics involves more than just recalling facts: it requires incorporating physical assumptions, maintaining consistent units, and providing clear scientific formats through coordinated approaches. To address these challenges, we present Reasoning With a Star, a newly contributed heliophysics dataset applicable to reasoning; we also provide an initial benchmarking approach. Our data are constructed from National Aeronautics and Space Administration & University Corporation for Atmospheric Research Living With a Star summer school problem sets and compiled into a readily consumable question-and-answer structure with question contexts, reasoning steps, expected answer type, ground-truth targets, format hints, and metadata. A programmatic grader checks the predictions using unit-aware numerical tolerance, symbolic equivalence, and schema validation. We benchmark a single-shot baseline and four multi-agent patterns, finding that decomposing workflows through systems engineering principles outperforms direct prompting on problems requiring deductive reasoning rather than pure inductive recall.

Abstract: While recent work has extended CoT to multimodal settings, achieving state-of-the-art results on science question answering benchmarks like ScienceQA, the generalizability of these approaches across diverse domains remains underexplored. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Multimodal-CoT) reasoning, evaluating its effectiveness on the A-OKVQA, OKVQA and ChartQA datasets, which requires broad commonsense and world knowledge beyond scientific reasoning. We implement the two-stage framework proposed by Zhang et al. [3], which separates rationale generation from answer inference and integrates vision features through a gated fusion mechanism with T5-based language models. Through systematic ablation studies, we analyze the contributions of vision features, rationale quality, and architectural choices. Our findings reveal that while vision integration significantly reduces hallucination in rationale generation, the effectiveness of CoT reasoning varies substantially across question types, with commonsense reasoning presenting particular challenges. This work provides practical insights for researchers implementing multimodal reasoning systems and identifies key areas for future improvement in cross-domain generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型常产生错误或过时内容，而无需昂贵重训练地高效准确更新知识是一个重大挑战，尤其在需要长期共存多个编辑且避免干扰的非结构化知识场景中。

Method: RILKE 将知识控制视为模型表示空间中的干预，设计了抗重述和编辑局部化的模块，使每次更新限制在低维子空间内，从而减少干扰；推理阶段使用查询自适应路由器动态选择对应模块以指导生成。

Result: 在 LLaMA 与 Qwen 模型上的实验显示，RILKE 具有高编辑成功率、强重述泛化能力，同时在较小内存开销下保持模型通用性，适用于大规模知识编辑任务。

Conclusion: RILKE 是一种有效且可扩展的大语言模型终身知识控制方案，能够在不更新基础权重的前提下实现精准、高效的多轮知识更新。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce incorrect or outdated content. Updating their knowledge efficiently and accurately without costly retraining is a major challenge. This problem is especially hard for complex, unstructured knowledge in a lifelong setting, where many edits must coexist without interference. We introduce RILKE (Representation Intervention for Lifelong KnowledgE Control), a robust and scalable method that treats knowledge control as interventions within the model's representation space. Leveraging representation-space expressiveness, we identify two properties enabling RILKE to deliver fine-grained control over complex, unstructured knowledge while maintaining general utility with frozen base weights. During training, RILKE learns paraphrase-robust and edit-localized modules that limit each update to a low-dimensional subspace to minimize cross-edit interference. In inference, a query-adaptive router selects the appropriate module to guide the model's generation. In evaluation on knowledge editing benchmarks with LLaMA and Qwen models, RILKE is scalable to large-scale datasets, demonstrating high edit success, strong paraphrase generalization, and preserving general utility with modest memory overhead. These results show RILKE is an effective and scalable solution for lifelong knowledge control in LLMs.

Motivation: 探究现代视觉语言模型是否具备具身认知特征，即智能是否源于感官运动互动而非被动观察。现有模型多为非具身训练，缺乏对交互式世界建模能力的系统评估，亟需一个能真实反映具身认知需求的评测基准。

Method: 提出ENACT基准，将其建模为部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP），以场景图变化作为动作；设计正向世界建模（从动作推断观察顺序）与逆向世界建模（从观察推断动作顺序）两种任务；利用机器人仿真数据（BEHAVIOR）自动生成大规模高质量的问答对，并基于此评估模型在长时程家庭活动场景下的表现。

Result: 实验表明，前沿视觉语言模型在长交互周期下与人类表现差距显著扩大；模型在逆向任务上普遍优于正向任务；模型表现出明显的类人偏见，如偏好右利手动作，对相机视角或内参偏离人类视觉时性能下降。

Conclusion: 当前主流视觉语言模型尚未充分具备具身认知的核心能力，其交互理解仍受限于非具身训练范式。ENACT提供了一种有效、可扩展的评估框架，有助于推动具身智能的研究与发展。

Abstract: Embodied cognition argues that intelligence arises from sensorimotor interaction rather than passive observation. It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

*Rahul Dass,Thomas Bowlin,Zebing Li,Xiao Jin,Ashok Goel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Ivy is an AI coaching system that enhances procedural skill learning by combining symbolic Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) models with a generative LLM. It ensures explanations are structured, causal, and goal-directed, improving accuracy in 'how' and 'why' questions compared to GPT and retrieval-augmented baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often produce fluent but shallow explanations lacking the causal, goal-directed, and compositional logic needed for effective procedural skill learning. There is a need for AI systems that provide deeper, structurally sound instructional explanations.

Method: Ivy integrates symbolic TMK models—encoding causal transitions, goal hierarchies, and problem decompositions—with a generative LLM. The LLM generates explanations while operating within structural constraints defined by the TMK model, ensuring pedagogical quality and logical coherence.

Result: Evaluations using expert and independent annotations show that Ivy's explanations significantly outperform GPT and retrieval-augmented GPT baselines in structural quality across three inferential dimensions, particularly for 'how' and 'why' questions.

Conclusion: Ivy demonstrates a scalable, effective approach to AI-generated explanations in education by combining symbolic structure with generative power, thereby enhancing the pedagogical value of intelligent coaching systems.

Abstract: In procedural skill learning, instructional explanations must convey not just steps, but the causal, goal-directed, and compositional logic behind them. Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent yet shallow responses that miss this structure. We present Ivy, an AI coaching system that delivers structured, multi-step explanations by combining symbolic Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) models with a generative interpretation layer-an LLM that constructs explanations while being constrained by TMK structure. TMK encodes causal transitions, goal hierarchies, and problem decompositions, and guides the LLM within explicit structural bounds. We evaluate Ivy against responses against GPT and retrieval-augmented GPT baselines using expert and independent annotations across three inferential dimensions. Results show that symbolic constraints consistently improve the structural quality of explanations for "how" and "why" questions. This study demonstrates a scalable AI for education approach that strengthens the pedagogical value of AI-generated explanations in intelligent coaching systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ICPO方法，利用LLM生成响应的概率差异来计算偏好优势分数，结合可验证奖励以优化探索过程，有效缓解奖励粗糙、噪声和过拟合问题，在多个基准测试中显著提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法存在奖励粒度粗、奖励噪声大和探索效率低等问题，导致训练不稳定和熵崩溃。

Method: 提出基于内在置信度的组相对偏好优化（ICPO），通过比较同一输入下多个响应的生成概率计算偏好优势分数，并与可验证奖励结合指导探索。

Result: ICPO有效缓解了奖励粗糙和噪声问题，抑制了过度自信错误，增强了低估值高质量响应的优势，防止模型过拟合特定策略，实现更充分的探索；在四个通用领域和三个数学基准上均优于GRPO。

Conclusion: ICPO通过利用模型自身的生成概率作为自评估信号，实现了更稳定、高效的强化学习训练，显著提升了LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies, thereby facilitating more thorough exploration. Comprehensive experiments across four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that ICPO steadily boosts reasoning compared to GRPO.

### [177] [Causality Without Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21260)
*Joseph Y. Halpern,Rafael Pass*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文抽象了Halpern和Pearl的因果定义，使其适用于更广泛的模型，包括允许回溯、涉及析取、否定、信念和嵌套反事实的情况，并扩展至解释的定义，深化对因果定义特征的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果定义（如Halpern-Pearl）在处理复杂逻辑结构（如析取、否定、嵌套反事实）及非传统模型时存在局限，需一种更具通用性的抽象框架以增强适用性和理论深度。

Method: 通过提取因果定义的核心特征，构建一个独立于具体模型的抽象框架，使该定义可应用于任何具备反事实语义的系统。

Result: 该抽象框架不仅扩大了因果分析的应用范围，还能处理复杂的逻辑表达式，同时为解释的定义提供通用基础，并揭示原定义中的关键特性。

Conclusion: 抽象化因果与解释定义的方法提升了理论灵活性与普适性，为跨模型因果推理提供了坚实基础，并深化了对因果本质的理解。

Abstract: Perhaps the most prominent current definition of (actual) causality is due to Halpern and Pearl.  It is defined using causal models (also known as structural equations models).  We abstract the definition, extracting its key features, so that it can be applied to any other model where counterfactuals are defined. By abstracting the definition, we gain a number of benefits. Not only can we apply the definition in a wider range of models, including ones that allow, for example, backtracking, but we can apply the definition to determine if A is a cause of B  even if A and B are formulas involving disjunctions, negations, beliefs, and nested counterfactuals (none of which can be handled by the Halpern-Pearl definition). Moreover, we can extend the ideas to getting an abstract definition of explanation that can be applied beyond causal models. Finally, we gain a deeper understanding of features of the definition  even in causal models.

*Jiayuan Zhang,Kaiquan Chen,Zhihao Lu,Enshen Zhou,Qian Yu,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Prune4Web提出一种新型范式，通过程序化剪枝替代大模型直接处理庞大的DOM结构，显著减少候选元素数量（25x-50x），提升网页自动化中的动作定位精度，同时避免信息丢失和注意力稀释。结合专用数据标注与双轮对话训练策略，在低级定位任务上准确率从46.8%提升至88.28%，达到当前最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的网页智能体在处理复杂网页时面临DOM结构过大（1万至10万令牌）导致的效率瓶颈，传统方法如粗略截断或使用启发式规则与独立排序模型，难以兼顾精度与可扩展性。

Method: 提出DOM树剪枝编程机制，利用大模型生成可执行的Python评分脚本，动态根据子任务语义线索过滤DOM元素；将原本需大模型读取的海量DOM转为轻量级程序遍历与评分，实现高效、可解释的剪枝。配合专用数据标注流程与双轮对话训练策略，统一优化规划器、程序化过滤器与定位器。

Result: 在低级接地任务中，准确率从46.8%大幅提升至88.28%；候选元素减少25倍至50倍，有效缓解注意力稀释问题，实现更高的精度与可扩展性。

Conclusion: Prune4Web通过将DOM处理从大模型推理转向程序化剪枝，显著提升了真实世界网页自动化任务的效率与准确性，为大规模网页交互提供了高效且可解释的新路径。

Abstract: Web automation employs intelligent agents to execute high-level tasks by mimicking human interactions with web interfaces. Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on our low-level grounding task, Prune4Web dramatically improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, underscoring its efficacy in real-world web automation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准对空间认知的简化处理（单一维度）无法捕捉其层级结构与相互依赖性，限制了对多模态大模型真实空间智能的评估。

Method: 提出层次化空间认知框架，分解空间智能为五级认知水平；构建覆盖15个任务的SpatialBench基准；设计统一的能力导向评价指标以实现跨异构任务评估。

Result: 多模态大模型在感知层面表现较好，但在符号推理、因果推断和规划等高级认知任务上存在明显短板；人类具有选择性、目标导向的抽象能力，而模型倾向于过度关注表面细节，缺乏连贯的空间意图。

Conclusion: 本研究首次建立系统性的多模态大模型空间认知评估框架，揭示了当前模型在高级空间推理上的局限，为未来空间智能系统的发展提供了理论基础与评估工具。

Abstract: Spatial cognition is fundamental to real-world multimodal intelligence, allowing models to effectively interact with the physical environment. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides, existing benchmarks often oversimplify spatial cognition, reducing it to a single-dimensional metric, which fails to capture the hierarchical structure and interdependence of spatial abilities. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical spatial cognition framework that decomposes spatial intelligence into five progressively complex levels from basic observation to high-level planning. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct SpatialBench, a large-scale, fine-grained benchmark covering 15 tasks aligned with these cognitive levels. To provide a unified evaluation across heterogeneous tasks, we further introduce a high-level capability-oriented metric that reliably assesses a model's overall spatial reasoning ability. Extensive experiments over massive MLLMs reveal distinct performance stratification across cognitive levels: models exhibit strong perceptual grounding yet remain limited in symbolic reasoning, causal inference, and planning. Additional human tests demonstrate that humans perform selective, goal-directed abstraction, while MLLMs tend to over-attend to surface details without coherent spatial intent. Our work establishes the first systematic framework for measuring hierarchical spatial cognition in MLLMs, laying the foundation for future spatially intelligent systems.

### [181] [Pessimistic Verification for Open Ended Math Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21522)
*Yanxing Huang,Zihan Tang,Zejin Lin,Peng Li,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为悲观验证（pessimistic verification）的简单但有效的技术，通过并行执行多个验证流程，并在任一验证报告错误时判定证明为错误，显著提升了开放性数学问题的验证性能。该方法在不增加大量计算资源的情况下，超越了扩展长思维链（long-CoT）在测试时缩放中的效率表现。案例研究发现，强模型中的多数假阴性实际上源于原始数据集的标注错误，因此该方法的真实性能被低估。悲观验证能有效提升语言模型输出的可靠性与数学任务表现，对实现长周期数学任务具有重要意义，未来研究有望进一步增强语言模型的数学能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学验证性能受限于错误检测能力，而当前模型在复杂数学问题上仍存在大量假阴性，尤其源于数据标注误差，亟需更鲁棒的验证机制以提升可靠性与准确性。

Method: 设计多种悲观验证变体，通过构建同一证明的多个并行验证流程，采用‘任一失败即判定为错误’的策略，实现对数学推理过程的严格检验。

Result: 该方法在多个数学验证基准上显著提升性能，且在计算效率上优于扩展长思维链；实证表明其真实效果被原始数据标注误差低估，具备高令牌效率和广泛适用性。

Conclusion: 悲观验证是一种高效、可靠的数学验证策略，可显著增强语言模型在复杂数学任务中的表现，对未来提升模型数学能力具有重要推动作用。

Abstract: The key limitation of the verification performance lies in the ability of error detection. With this intuition we designed several variants of pessimistic verification, which are simple workflows that could significantly improve the verification of open-ended math questions. In pessimistic verification we construct multiple parallel verifications for the same proof, and the proof is deemed incorrect if any one of them reports an error. This simple technique significantly improves the performance across many math verification benchmarks without incurring substantial computational resources. Its token efficiency even surpassed extended long-CoT in test-time scaling. Our case studies further indicate that the majority of false negatives in stronger models are actually caused by annotation errors in the original dataset, so our method's performance is in fact underestimated. Self-verification for mathematical problems can effectively improve the reliability and performance of language model outputs, and it also plays a critical role in enabling long-horizon mathematical tasks. We believe that research on pessimistic verification will help enhance the mathematical capabilities of language models across a wide range of tasks.

### [182] [Self-Transparency Failures in Expert-Persona LLMs: A Large-Scale Behavioral Audit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21569)
*Alex Diep*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了语言模型在高风险专业领域中自我透明性（即披露其AI身份）的表现，发现模型在不同专业角色下披露行为存在显著差异：金融顾问角色的初始披露率为30.8%，而神经外科医生角色仅为3.5%。披露率范围为2.8%至73.6%，且模型身份比参数规模更能预测行为（ΔR²=0.359 vs 0.018）。优化推理能力反而抑制了透明性，部分模型推理版本披露率比基础版本低48.4%。研究通过贝叶斯验证确认结果稳健（κ=0.908），表明透明性由训练因素决定而非模型规模。组织不能假设安全属性可迁移，需设计并实证验证行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当语言模型无法在专业场景中可靠披露其AI身份时，用户难以判断其能力边界，从而可能导致信任误判和潜在危害。尤其在高风险领域，虚假专业知识可能造成严重后果，因此需要评估模型在特定专业角色下的自我透明性表现。

Method: 采用通用花园实验设计，对16个开源权重模型（参数量4B至671B）在19,200次测试中进行审计，评估其在金融顾问、神经外科医生等专业角色下的自我披露行为。通过比较不同模型、参数规模、是否启用推理优化等因素对披露率的影响，并使用贝叶斯方法与Rogan-Gladen校正处理测量误差，验证结果稳健性。

Result: 模型在不同专业角色中的披露率差异显著：金融顾问角色平均披露30.8%，神经外科医生仅3.5%；披露率跨度达2.8%至73.6%。模型身份是行为更优预测因子（ΔR²=0.359），而非参数规模（ΔR²=0.018）。推理优化版本的披露率显著低于基础版本，最高降低48.4%。贝叶斯验证显示结果高度稳健（κ=0.908）。

Conclusion: 模型的自我透明性并非由规模决定，而是受训练因素影响。在部署前必须针对具体应用场景进行行为设计与实证验证，不能默认安全属性可迁移。否则可能引发‘逆盖尔-曼失忆’效应，即用户因某些领域透明而过度信任其他不透明领域，导致风险累积。

Abstract: If a language model cannot reliably disclose its AI identity in expert contexts, users cannot trust its competence boundaries. This study examines self-transparency in models assigned professional personas within high-stakes domains where false expertise risks user harm. Using a common-garden design, sixteen open-weight models (4B--671B parameters) were audited across 19,200 trials. Models exhibited sharp domain-specific inconsistency: a Financial Advisor persona elicited 30.8% disclosure initially, while a Neurosurgeon persona elicited only 3.5%. This creates preconditions for a "Reverse Gell-Mann Amnesia" effect, where transparency in some domains leads users to overgeneralize trust to contexts where disclosure fails. Disclosure ranged from 2.8% to 73.6%, with a 14B model reaching 61.4% while a 70B produced just 4.1%. Model identity predicted behavior better than parameter count ($ΔR_{adj}^{2} = 0.359$ vs 0.018). Reasoning optimization actively suppressed self-transparency in some models, with reasoning variants showing up to 48.4% lower disclosure than base counterparts. Bayesian validation with Rogan--Gladen correction confirmed robustness to measurement error ($κ= 0.908$). These findings demonstrate transparency reflects training factors rather than scale. Organizations cannot assume safety properties transfer to deployment contexts, requiring deliberate behavior design and empirical verification.

Abstract: In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and complex global challenges, responsible foresight has emerged as an essential framework for policymakers aiming to navigate future uncertainties and shape the future. Responsible foresight entails the ethical anticipation of emerging opportunities and risks, with a focus on fostering proactive, sustainable, and accountable future design. This paper coins the term "responsible computational foresight", examining the role of human-centric artificial intelligence and computational modeling in advancing responsible foresight, establishing a set of foundational principles for this new field and presenting a suite of AI-driven foresight tools currently shaping it. AI, particularly in conjunction with simulations and scenario analysis, enhances policymakers' ability to address uncertainty, evaluate risks, and devise strategies geared toward sustainable, resilient futures. However, responsible foresight extends beyond mere technical forecasting; it demands a nuanced understanding of the interdependencies within social, environmental, economic and political systems, alongside a commitment to ethical, long-term decision-making that supports human intelligence. We argue that AI will play a role as a supportive tool in responsible, human-centered foresight, complementing rather than substituting policymaker judgment to enable the proactive shaping of resilient and ethically sound futures. This paper advocates for the thoughtful integration of AI into foresight practices to empower policymakers and communities as they confront the grand challenges of the 21st century.
