Prior work on modified Rankin Scale (mRS) prediction has relied primarily on structured variables (e.g., age, NIHSS) and conventional machine learning. The ability of large language models (LLMs) to infer future mRS scores directly from routine admission notes remains largely unexplored. We evaluated encoder (BERT, NYUTron) and generative (Llama-3.1-8B, MedGemma-4B) LLMs, in both frozen and fine-tuned settings, for discharge and 90-day mRS prediction using a large, real-world stroke registry. The discharge outcome dataset included 9,485 History and Physical notes and the 90-day outcome dataset included 1,898 notes from the NYU Langone Get With The Guidelines-Stroke registry (2016-2025). Data were temporally split with the most recent 12 months held out for testing. Performance was assessed using exact (7-class) mRS accuracy and binary functional outcome (mRS 0-2 vs. 3-6) accuracy and compared against established structured-data baselines incorporating NIHSS and age. Fine-tuned Llama achieved the highest performance, with 90-day exact mRS accuracy of 33.9% [95% CI, 27.9-39.9%] and binary accuracy of 76.3% [95% CI, 70.7-81.9%]. Discharge performance reached 42.0% [95% CI, 39.0-45.0%] exact accuracy and 75.0% [95% CI, 72.4-77.6%] binary accuracy. For 90-day prediction, Llama performed comparably to structured-data baselines. Fine-tuned LLMs can predict post-stroke functional outcomes from admission notes alone, achieving performance comparable to models requiring structured variable abstraction. Our findings support the development of text-based prognostic tools that integrate seamlessly into clinical workflows without manual data extraction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u6025\u6027\u7f3a\u8840\u6027\u5352\u4e2d\u60a3\u8005\u51fa\u9662\u53ca90\u5929\u540e\u6539\u826fRankin\u91cf\u8868\uff08mRS\uff09\u9884\u540e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5165\u9662\u8bb0\u5f55\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684Llama\u6a21\u578b\u572890\u5929mRS\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523033.9%\u76847\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c76.3%\u7684\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u5e74\u9f84\u3001NIHSS\uff09\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5352\u4e2d\u529f\u80fd\u9884\u540e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53d8\u91cf\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u5165\u9662\u75c5\u5386\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u63a8\u65ad\u529f\u80fd\u7ed3\u5c40\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1LLMs\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ec5\u51ed\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6587\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u9884\u540e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u96c6\u6210\u5de5\u5177\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5927\u5b66\u6717\u683c\u5c3c\u5352\u4e2d\u6ce8\u518c\u5e93\uff082016-2025\u5e74\uff09\u76849,485\u4efd\u5165\u9662\u8bb0\u5f55\uff08\u51fa\u9662\u7ed3\u5c40\uff09\u548c1,898\u4efd\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0890\u5929\u7ed3\u5c40\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5272\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u6700\u8fd112\u4e2a\u6708\u6570\u636e\u7528\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u7f16\u7801\u578b\uff08BERT\u3001NYUTron\uff09\u548c\u751f\u6210\u578b\uff08Llama-3.1-8B\u3001MedGemma-4B\uff09LLMs\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u4e24\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u75287\u7c7bmRS\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u548c\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u529f\u80fd\u7ed3\u5c40\uff08mRS 0-2 vs. 3-6\uff09\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4ef7\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5305\u542b\u5e74\u9f84\u548cNIHSS\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684Llama\u6a21\u578b\u572890\u5929\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523033.9%\u76847\u7c7bmRS\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0895% CI: 27.9\u201339.9%\uff09\u548c76.3%\u7684\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0895% CI: 70.7\u201381.9%\uff09\uff1b\u51fa\u9662\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a42.0%\uff0895% CI: 39.0\u201345.0%\uff09\u548c75.0%\uff0895% CI: 72.4\u201377.6%\uff09\u3002\u572890\u5929\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03LLM\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5165\u9662\u75c5\u5386\u6587\u672c\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u5352\u4e2d\u540e\u529f\u80fd\u7ed3\u5c40\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u5ab2\u7f8e\u9700\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53d8\u91cf\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u9884\u540e\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002"}}

The transition from competition-level problem-solving to professional research, however, requires navigating vast literature and constructing long-horizon proofs. In this work, we introduce Aletheia, a math research agent that iteratively generates, verifies, and revises solutions end-to-end in natural language. Specifically, Aletheia is powered by an advanced version of Gemini Deep Think for challenging reasoning problems, a novel inference-time scaling law that extends beyond Olympiad-level problems, and intensive tool use to navigate the complexities of mathematical research. We demonstrate the capability of Aletheia from Olympiad problems to PhD-level exercises and most notably, through several distinct milestones in AI-assisted mathematics research: (a) a research paper (Feng26) generated by AI without any human intervention in calculating certain structure constants in arithmetic geometry called eigenweights; (b) a research paper (LeeSeo26) demonstrating human-AI collaboration in proving bounds on systems of interacting particles called independent sets; and (c) an extensive semi-autonomous evaluation (Feng et al., 2026a) of 700 open problems on Bloom's Erdos Conjectures database, including autonomous solutions to four open questions. In order to help the public better understand the developments pertaining to AI and mathematics, we suggest codifying standard levels quantifying autonomy and novelty of AI-assisted results.

However, current evaluation frameworks lack a consensus metric and suffer from two critical flaws: they often assume independence across time steps or variables, and they demonstrably lack sensitivity to tail events, the very occurrences that are most pivotal in real-world decision-making. To address these limitations, we propose two kernel-based metrics: the signature maximum mean discrepancy (Sig-MMD) and our novel censored Sig-MMD (CSig-MMD). By leveraging the signature kernel, these metrics capture complex inter-variate and inter-temporal dependencies and remain robust to missing data. Furthermore, CSig-MMD introduces a censoring scheme that prioritizes a forecaster's capability to predict tail events while strictly maintaining properness, a vital property for a good scoring rule.

Versor is validated on chaotic N-body dynamics, topological reasoning, and standard multimodal benchmarks (CIFAR-10, WikiText-103), consistently outperforming Transformers, Graph Networks, and geometric baselines (GATr, EGNN). Key results include: orders of magnitude fewer parameters ($200\\times$ vs. Transformers); interpretable attention decomposing into proximity and orientational components; zero-shot scale generalization (99.3% MCC on topology vs. 50.4% for ViT); and $O(L)$ linear complexity via the novel Recursive Rotor Accumulator.

Sappa"], "title": "Multi-encoder ConvNeXt Network with Smooth Attentional Feature Fusion for Multispectral Semantic Segmentation", "comment": "This is an extended version of the study presented at IEEE SoutheastCon2025. It presents substantial new content and original contributions beyond the previous version, including an expanded and enhanced background, new architectural refinements, additional experiments conducted on a broader range of datasets and experimental scenarios, and a more comprehensive analysis of results", "summary": "This work proposes MeCSAFNet, a multi-branch encoder-decoder architecture for land cover segmentation in multispectral imagery. The model separately processes visible and non-visible channels through dual ConvNeXt encoders, followed by individual decoders that reconstruct spatial information. A dedicated fusion decoder integrates intermediate features at multiple scales, combining fine spatial cues with high-level spectral representations. The feature fusion is further enhanced with CBAM attention, and the ASAU activation function contributes to stable and efficient optimization. The model is designed to process different spectral configurations, including a 4-channel (4c) input combining RGB and NIR bands, as well as a 6-channel (6c) input incorporating NDVI and NDWI indices. Experiments on the Five-Billion-Pixels (FBP) and Potsdam datasets demonstrate significant performance gains. On FBP, MeCSAFNet-base (6c) surpasses U-Net (4c) by +19.21%, U-Net (6c) by +14.72%, SegFormer (4c) by +19.62%, and SegFormer (6c) by +14.74% in mIoU. On Potsdam, MeCSAFNet-large (4c) improves over DeepLabV3+ (4c) by +6.48%, DeepLabV3+ (6c) by +5.85%, SegFormer (4c) by +9.11%, and SegFormer (6c) by +4.80% in mIoU.

Prior work treats lazy thinking detection as a single-label task, but review segments may exhibit multiple issues, including broader clarity problems, or specificity issues. Turning detection into actionable improvements requires guideline-aware feedback, which is currently missing. We introduce an LLM-driven framework that decomposes reviews into argumentative segments, identifies issues via a neurosymbolic module combining LLM features with traditional classifiers, and generates targeted feedback using issue-specific templates refined by a genetic algorithm. Experiments show our method outperforms zero-shot LLM baselines and improves review quality by up to 92.4\\%.

MVN-Grad scales each coordinate by an exponential moving average of gradient uncertainty and applies momentum to the resulting normalized gradients, eliminating the cross-time coupling between stale momentum and a stochastic normalizer present in standard Adam-type updates. We prove that this decoupling yields strictly smaller one-step conditional update variance than momentum-then-normalize variance methods under standard noise assumptions, and that MVN-Grad is robust to outliers: it has a uniformly bounded response to single gradient spikes.\n  In low-variance regimes, we further show variance normalization avoids sign-type collapse associated with second-moment scaling and can yield accelerated convergence. Across CIFAR-100 image classification and GPT-style language modeling benchmarks, MVN-Grad matches or outperforms Adam, AdaBelief, and LaProp, delivering smoother training and improved generalization with no added overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "MVN-Grad \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7c7b\u4f3c Adam \u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u65b9\u5dee\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u548c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u540e\u7684\u52a8\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5b83\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6307\u6570\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u5747\u6765\u7f29\u653e\u5404\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u540e\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5e94\u7528\u52a8\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u8026\u4e86\u65e7\u52a8\u91cf\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u8026\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u566a\u58f0\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u9c81\u68d2\u3002\u5728\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u65b9\u5dee\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u7b26\u53f7\u5d29\u6e83\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\u3002\u5728 CIFAR-100 \u548c GPT \u98ce\u683c\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cMVN-Grad \u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u5339\u914d Adam\u3001AdaBelief \u548c LaProp\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u5e73\u7a33\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709 Adam \u7c7b\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u52a8\u91cf\u4e0e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u987a\u5e8f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u8026\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u533a\u57df\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u7b26\u53f7\u7c7b\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa MVN-Grad\uff0c\u5c06\u65b9\u5dee\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4e0e\u52a8\u91cf\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5148\u5bf9\u68af\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u6570\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u5747\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff0c\u518d\u65bd\u52a0\u52a8\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u91cf\u4e0e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0cMVN-Grad \u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u7684\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u4e3b\u6d41\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "MVN-Grad \u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4e0e\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

We begin by analyzing the fundamental challenges of fusing visual and linguistic information in charts. We then categorize downstream tasks and datasets, introducing a novel taxonomy of canonical and non-canonical benchmarks to highlight the field's expanding scope. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive evolution of methodologies, tracing the progression from classic deep learning techniques to state-of-the-art MLLM paradigms that leverage sophisticated fusion strategies. By critically examining the limitations of current models, particularly their perceptual and reasoning deficits, we identify promising future directions, including advanced alignment techniques and reinforcement learning for cognitive enhancement.

Recently, reasoning in continuous latent space has emerged as a promising alternative, enabling more robust inference and flexible computation beyond discrete token constraints. However, current latent paradigms often suffer from feature collapse and instability, stemming from distribution mismatches when recurrently using hidden states as the input embeddings, or alignment issues when relying on assistant models. To address this, we propose Latent Thoughts Tuning (LT-Tuning), a framework that redefines how latent thoughts are constructed and deployed. Instead of relying solely on raw hidden states, our method introduces a Context-Prediction-Fusion mechanism that jointly leveraging contextual hidden states and predictive semantic guidance from the vocabulary embedding space. Combined with a progressive three-stage curriculum learning pipeline, LT-Tuning also enables dynamically switching between latent and explicit thinking modes.

However, existing medical benchmarks remain static, suffering from two critical limitations: (1) data contamination, where test sets inadvertently leak into training corpora, leading to inflated performance estimates; and (2) temporal misalignment, failing to capture the rapid evolution of medical knowledge. Furthermore, current evaluation metrics for open-ended clinical reasoning often rely on either shallow lexical overlap (e.g., ROUGE) or subjective LLM-as-a-Judge scoring, both inadequate for verifying clinical correctness. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LiveMedBench, a continuously updated, contamination-free, and rubric-based benchmark that weekly harvests real-world clinical cases from online medical communities, ensuring strict temporal separation from model training data. We propose a Multi-Agent Clinical Curation Framework that filters raw data noise and validates clinical integrity against evidence-based medical principles. For evaluation, we develop an Automated Rubric-based Evaluation Framework that decomposes physician responses into granular, case-specific criteria, achieving substantially stronger alignment with expert physicians than LLM-as-a-Judge. To date, LiveMedBench comprises 2,756 real-world cases spanning 38 medical specialties and multiple languages, paired with 16,702 unique evaluation criteria. Extensive evaluation of 38 LLMs reveals that even the best-performing model achieves only 39.2%, and 84% of models exhibit performance degradation on post-cutoff cases, confirming pervasive data contamination risks. Error analysis further identifies contextual application-not factual knowledge-as the dominant bottleneck, with 35-48% of failures stemming from the inability to tailor medical knowledge to patient-specific constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLiveMedBench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\u3001\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6bcf\u5468\u4ece\u5728\u7ebf\u533b\u7597\u793e\u533a\u91c7\u96c6\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e34\u5e8a\u6574\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u8fc7\u6ee4\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e34\u5e8a\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u5206\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u8fbe39.2%\u6b63\u786e\u7387\uff0c84%\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65b0\u75c5\u4f8b\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u5728\u4e8e\u60c5\u5883\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u800c\u975e\u77e5\u8bc6\u672c\u8eab\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u7597\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6f14\u8fdb\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6d45\u5c42\u6587\u672c\u91cd\u53e0\u6216\u4e3b\u89c2LLM\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e34\u5e8a\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaLiveMedBench\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bcf\u5468\u4ece\u5728\u7ebf\u533b\u7597\u793e\u533a\u91c7\u96c6\u771f\u5b9e\u75c5\u4f8b\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u79bb\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e34\u5e8a\u6574\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u6e05\u6d17\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "LiveMedBench\u5305\u542b2,756\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u75c5\u4f8b\uff0c\u8986\u76d638\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u4e13\u79d1\u53ca\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u517116,702\u6761\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff1b38\u4e2aLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec5\u4e3a39.2%\uff0c84%\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65b0\u75c5\u4f8b\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u662f\u60c5\u5883\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u91cd\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5c06\u901a\u7528\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u9002\u914d\u5230\u5177\u4f53\u60a3\u8005\u60c5\u5883\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u5fc5\u987b\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u53bb\u6c61\u67d3\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u53ef\u4fe1\u533b\u7597AI\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods focus only on the visual modality and compute prototypes directly from raw support images, which lack comprehensive and rich multimodal information. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multimodal Prototype Augmentation FSL framework called MPA, including LLM-based Multi-Variant Semantic Enhancement (LMSE), Hierarchical Multi-View Augmentation (HMA), and an Adaptive Uncertain Class Absorber (AUCA). LMSE leverages large language models to generate diverse paraphrased category descriptions, enriching the support set with additional semantic cues. HMA exploits both natural and multi-view augmentations to enhance feature diversity (e.g., changes in viewing distance, camera angles, and lighting conditions). AUCA models uncertainty by introducing uncertain classes via interpolation and Gaussian sampling, effectively absorbing uncertain samples. Extensive experiments on four single-domain and six cross-domain FSL benchmarks demonstrate that MPA achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods across most settings.

However, RL suffers from sample inefficiency and a lack of semantic interpretability in complex scenarios. Foundation Models, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs), can mitigate this by offering rich, context-aware knowledge, yet their high inference latency hinders deployment in high-frequency RL training loops. To bridge this gap, we present Found-RL, a platform tailored to efficiently enhance RL for AD using foundation models. A core innovation is the asynchronous batch inference framework, which decouples heavy VLM reasoning from the simulation loop, effectively resolving latency bottlenecks to support real-time learning. We introduce diverse supervision mechanisms: Value-Margin Regularization (VMR) and Advantage-Weighted Action Guidance (AWAG) to effectively distill expert-like VLM action suggestions into the RL policy. Additionally, we adopt high-throughput CLIP for dense reward shaping. We address CLIP's dynamic blindness via Conditional Contrastive Action Alignment, which conditions prompts on discretized speed/command and yields a normalized, margin-based bonus from context-specific action-anchor scoring. Found-RL provides an end-to-end pipeline for fine-tuned VLM integration and shows that a lightweight RL model can achieve near-VLM performance compared with billion-parameter VLMs while sustaining real-time inference (approx. 500 FPS).

Augmenting LLMs with hybrid external knowledge, such as unstructured text and structured knowledge graphs, offers a promising alternative to costly continual pretraining. As such, reliable evaluation of their retrieval and reasoning capabilities becomes critical. However, many existing benchmarks increasingly overlap with LLM pretraining data, which means answers or supporting knowledge may already be encoded in model parameters, making it difficult to distinguish genuine retrieval and reasoning from parametric recall. We introduce HybridRAG-Bench, a framework for constructing benchmarks to evaluate retrieval-intensive, multi-hop reasoning over hybrid knowledge. HybridRAG-Bench automatically couples unstructured text and structured knowledge graph representations derived from recent scientific literature on arXiv, and generates knowledge-intensive question-answer pairs grounded in explicit reasoning paths. The framework supports flexible domain and time-frame selection, enabling contamination-aware and customizable evaluation as models and knowledge evolve. Experiments across three domains (artificial intelligence, governance and policy, and bioinformatics) demonstrate that HybridRAG-Bench rewards genuine retrieval and reasoning rather than parametric recall, offering a principled testbed for evaluating hybrid knowledge-augmented reasoning systems.

In this paper, we dissect the internal mechanisms governing long-context processing in VLMs to understand their performance bottlenecks. Through the lens of attention analysis, we identify specific Visual Evidence Retrieval (VER) Heads - a sparse, dynamic set of attention heads critical for locating visual cues during reasoning, distinct from static OCR heads. We demonstrate that these heads are causal to model performance; masking them leads to significant degradation. Leveraging this discovery, we propose VERA (Visual Evidence Retrieval Augmentation), a training-free framework that detects model uncertainty (i.e., entropy) to trigger the explicit verbalization of visual evidence attended by VER heads. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that VERA significantly improves long-context understanding of open-source VLMs: it yields an average relative improvement of 21.3% on Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct and 20.1% on GLM-4.1V-Thinking across five benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u957f\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\uff08VER\uff09\u5934\u7684\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u5b9a\u4f4d\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684VERA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u71b5\uff09\u89e6\u53d1\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5f00\u6e90VLM\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe21.3%\u548c20.1%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u5de5\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5173\u952e\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\uff08VER\uff09\u5934\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff0c\u8d1f\u8d23\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\uff1b\u8fdb\u800c\u63d0\u51faVERA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u71b5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u89e6\u53d1\u5bf9\u88abVER\u5934\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u663e\u5f0f\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "result": "VERA\u5728Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct\u548cGLM-4.1V-Thinking\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8621.3%\u548c20.1%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "VERA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u63ed\u793a\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u5934\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u5347\u4e86VLM\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Using behavioral evaluations and causal-mechanistic experiments via functional localization methods inspired by cognitive neuroscience, we analyze LMs' performance across seven subcategories of ToM abilities (Beaudoin et al., 2020) on a substantially larger localizer dataset than used in prior like-minded work. Results from stringent hypothesis-driven statistical testing offer suggestive evidence for the functional integration hypothesis, indicating that LMs may develop interconnected \"social world models\" rather than isolated competencies.

By contrast, the theoretical underpinnings of the dependence of LoRA's accuracy on update rank remain relatively unexplored. In this work, we compare the accuracy of rank-r LoRA updates against full-parameter updates for fine-tuning tasks from a dynamical systems perspective. We perform gradient flow analysis in both full-rank and low-rank regimes to establish explicit relationships between rank and accuracy for two loss functions under LoRA. While gradient flow equations for LoRA are presented in prior work, we rigorously derive their form and show that they are identical for simultaneous and sequential LoRA parameter updates. We then use the resulting dynamical system equations to obtain closed-form relationships between LoRA rank and accuracy for trace-squared and Frobenius-norm low-rank approximation loss functions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790\u4e86LoRA\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u5fae\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u66f4\u65b0\u79e9\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5728\u5168\u79e9\u548c\u4f4e\u79e9\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u8ff9\u5e73\u65b9\u548cFrobenius\u8303\u6570\uff09\u4e0b\u79e9\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u540c\u65f6\u4e0e\u987a\u5e8f\u66f4\u65b0\u7684LoRA\u53c2\u6570\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u79e9\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5df2\u6709\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eLoRA\u5728\u4f4e\u79e9\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u79e91\uff09\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u66f4\u65b0\u79e9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5185\u5728\u539f\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5728\u5168\u79e9\u4e0e\u4f4e\u79e9\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5efa\u6a21LoRA\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u4e25\u683c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u540c\u65f6\u4e0e\u987a\u5e8f\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0b\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e24\u79cd\u4f4e\u79e9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u8ff9\u5e73\u65b9\u4e0eFrobenius\u8303\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u79e9\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5efa\u7acb\u4e24\u79cd\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e0bLoRA\u66f4\u65b0\u79e9\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u6570\u5b66\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f4e\u79e9\u66f4\u65b0\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u79e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aLoRA\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u79e9\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u79e9\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u516c\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6307\u5bfc\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u79e9\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

Inference-Time Scaling in Language Models as Adaptive Resource Rationality", "comment": null, "summary": "Human reasoning is shaped by resource rationality -- optimizing performance under constraints. Recently, inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm to improve the reasoning performance of Large Language Models by expanding test-time computation. Specifically, instruction-tuned (IT) models explicitly generate long reasoning steps during inference, whereas Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are trained by reinforcement learning to discover reasoning paths that maximize accuracy. However, it remains unclear whether resource-rationality can emerge from such scaling without explicit reward related to computational costs. We introduce a Variable Attribution Task in which models infer which variables determine outcomes given candidate variables, input-output trials, and predefined logical functions. By varying the number of candidate variables and trials, we systematically manipulate task complexity. Both models exhibit a transition from brute-force to analytic strategies as complexity increases. IT models degrade on XOR and XNOR functions, whereas LRMs remain robust. These findings suggest that models can adjust their reasoning behavior in response to task complexity, even without explicit cost-based reward. It provides compelling evidence that resource rationality is an emergent property of inference-time scaling itself.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u81ea\u7136\u4ea7\u751f\u8d44\u6e90\u7406\u6027\uff08\u5373\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u53d8\u5c5e\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u968f\u7740\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff08IT\uff09\u548c\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRM\uff09\u5747\u4ece\u66b4\u529b\u641c\u7d22\u8f6c\u5411\u5206\u6790\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1IT\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f02\u6216\uff08XOR\uff09\u548c\u540c\u6216\uff08XNOR\uff09\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800cLRM\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u4f46\u4e24\u8005\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6ca1\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u8d44\u6e90\u7406\u6027\u4ecd\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5185\u751f\u7279\u6027\u51fa\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u8ba1\u7b97\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4fc3\u4f7f\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u53d1\u5f62\u6210\u8d44\u6e90\u7406\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5373\u5728\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u5f15\u5165\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53d8\u91cf\u5f52\u5c5e\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6539\u53d8\u5019\u9009\u53d8\u91cf\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u6837\u672c\u6570\u4ee5\u8c03\u8282\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff08IT\uff09\u548c\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRM\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u968f\u7740\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u4e24\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u4ece\u66b4\u529b\u641c\u7d22\u8f6c\u5411\u5206\u6790\u6027\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u5176\u4e2dIT\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u903b\u8f91\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5982XOR\u3001XNOR\uff09\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800cLRM\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u8fd9\u8bf4\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u8c03\u6574\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u6210\u672c\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d44\u6e90\u7406\u6027\u662f\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5185\u751f\u4ea7\u7269\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5fc5\u987b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u6210\u672c\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Recent works show that large language models (LLMs) can function as generalized planners. This work investigates whether LLMs can serve as QNP abstraction generators for GP problems and how to fix abstractions via automated debugging. We propose a prompt protocol: input a GP domain and training tasks to LLMs, prompting them to generate abstract features and further abstract the initial state, action set, and goal into QNP problems. An automated debugging method is designed to detect abstraction errors, guiding LLMs to fix abstractions. Experiments demonstrate that under properly guided by automated debugging, some LLMs can generate useful QNP abstractions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e7f\u4e49\u89c4\u5212\uff08GP\uff09\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5b9a\u6027\u6570\u503c\u89c4\u5212\uff08QNP\uff09\u62bd\u8c61\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8c03\u8bd5\u4fee\u590d\u62bd\u8c61\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8c03\u8bd5\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0b\uff0c\u90e8\u5206LLMs\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u6709\u7528\u7684QNP\u62bd\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5e7f\u4e49\u89c4\u5212\uff08GP\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u624b\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u5b9a\u6027\u6570\u503c\u89c4\u5212\uff08QNP\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u91cd\u8981\u62bd\u8c61\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u62bd\u8c61\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u9700\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22LLMs\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210QNP\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8c03\u8bd5\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u534f\u8bae\uff1a\u5c06GP\u9886\u57df\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u8f93\u5165LLM\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5176\u751f\u6210\u62bd\u8c61\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u96c6\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u62bd\u8c61\u4e3aQNP\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8c03\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u62bd\u8c61\u9519\u8bef\u5e76\u6307\u5bfcLLM\u4fee\u6b63\u62bd\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8c03\u8bd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0b\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u7684QNP\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u62bd\u8c61\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u89c4\u5212\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u751f\u6210\u6709\u7528QNP\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8c03\u8bd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u89c4\u5212\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

While existing unsupervised methods attempt to analyze these variations via output features, they omit the underlying generative process. In this work, we propose a framework to disentangle these semantic directions directly within the input embedding space. To that end, we collect a set of gradients obtained by backpropagating the differences between stochastic realizations of a fixed prompt that we later decompose into meaningful steering directions with either Principal Components Analysis or Sparse Autoencoder. Our approach yields three key contributions: (1) it isolates interpretable, steerable directions for precise, fine-grained control over a single concept; (2) it effectively mitigates mode collapse in distilled models by reintroducing lost diversity; and (3) it establishes a novel estimator for concept complexity under a specific model, based on the dimensionality of the discovered subspace.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u89e3\u8026\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5355\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u5229\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u7684\u968f\u673a\u8f93\u51fa\u5dee\u5f02\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u83b7\u53d6\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7PCA\u6216\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u7f13\u89e3\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d1\u73b0\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u5ff5\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5927\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u63a7\u5236\u5177\u4f53\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u4f53\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5206\u6790\u8f93\u51fa\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u672c\u8eab\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u89e3\u8026\u8bed\u4e49\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u56fa\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u4e0b\u591a\u4e2a\u968f\u673a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u5dee\u5f02\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u83b7\u5f97\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\uff08PCA\uff09\u6216\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08Sparse Autoencoder\uff09\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u68af\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u660e\u786e\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u53ef\u64cd\u63a7\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5206\u79bb\u51fa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53ef\u64cd\u63a7\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\uff1b\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u89e3\u8026\u8bed\u4e49\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u6982\u5ff5\u590d\u6742\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

In this work, we conduct a closed-loop evaluation of state-of-the-art autonomous driving agents under black-box adversarial threat models in CARLA. Specifically, we consider three representative attack vectors on the visual perception pipeline: (i) a physics-based blur attack induced by acoustic waves, (ii) an electromagnetic interference attack that distorts captured images, and (iii) a digital attack that adds ghost objects as carefully crafted bounded perturbations on images. Our experiments on two advanced agents, Transfuser and Interfuser, reveal severe vulnerabilities to such attacks, with driving scores dropping by up to 99% in the worst case, raising valid safety concerns. To help mitigate such threats, we further propose a lightweight Attack Detection model for Autonomous Driving systems (AD$^2$) based on attention mechanisms that capture spatial-temporal consistency. Comprehensive experiments across multi-camera inputs on CARLA show that our detector achieves superior detection capability and computational efficiency compared to existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9ed1\u76d2\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CARLA\u5e73\u53f0\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u5411\u91cf\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u58f0\u6ce2\u6a21\u7cca\u653b\u51fb\u3001\u7535\u78c1\u5e72\u6270\u653b\u51fb\u4ee5\u53ca\u6570\u5b57\u9b3c\u5f71\u7269\u4f53\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u5982Transfuser\u548cInterfuser\u5728\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e25\u91cd\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u9a7e\u9a76\u8bc4\u5206\u6700\u9ad8\u4e0b\u964d99%\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u51fa\u91cd\u5927\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578bAD\u00b2\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u5404\u7c7b\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u7269\u7406\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u653b\u51fb\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e09\u7c7b\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff08\u7269\u7406\u58f0\u6ce2\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u7535\u78c1\u5e72\u6270\u3001\u6570\u5b57\u9b3c\u5f71\u6270\u52a8\uff09\uff0c\u5728CARLA\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bf9Transfuser\u548cInterfuser\u8fdb\u884c\u95ed\u73af\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff1b\u63d0\u51faAD\u00b2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u8f93\u5165\u95f4\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u4f7f\u9a7e\u9a76\u8bc4\u5206\u6700\u9ad8\u4e0b\u964d99%\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff1b\u6240\u63d0AD\u00b2\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u4e0e\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u91cd\u5bf9\u6297\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7269\u7406\u4e0e\u6570\u5b57\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684AD\u00b2\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u5fc5\u987b\u7eb3\u5165\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Respect is a central dimension of these interactions, shaping public trust and perceived legitimacy, yet its interpretation is inherently subjective and shaped by lived experience, rendering community-specific perspectives a critical consideration. Leveraging unprecedented access to Los Angeles Police Department BWC footage, we introduce the first large-scale traffic-stop dataset annotated with respect ratings and free-text rationales from multiple perspectives. By sampling annotators from police-affiliated, justice-system-impacted, and non-affiliated Los Angeles residents, we enable the systematic study of perceptual differences across diverse communities. To this end, we (i) develop a domain-specific evaluation rubric grounded in procedural justice theory, LAPD training materials, and extensive fieldwork; (ii) introduce a rubric-driven preference data construction framework for perspective-consistent alignment; and (iii) propose a perspective-aware modeling framework that predicts personalized respect ratings and generates annotator-specific rationales for both officers and civilian drivers from traffic-stop transcripts. Across all three annotator groups, our approach improves both rating prediction performance and rationale alignment. Our perspective-aware framework enables law enforcement to better understand diverse community expectations, providing a vital tool for building public trust and procedural legitimacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u6d1b\u6749\u77f6\u8b66\u5bdf\u5c40\u6267\u6cd5\u8bb0\u5f55\u4eea\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4ea4\u901a\u62e6\u622a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6765\u81ea\u8b66\u5bdf\u3001\u53d7\u53f8\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f71\u54cd\u7fa4\u4f53\u53ca\u666e\u901a\u5c45\u6c11\u4e09\u7c7b\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u5c0a\u91cd\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u81ea\u7531\u6587\u672c\u7406\u7531\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6b63\u4e49\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u53ca\u89c6\u89d2\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5c0a\u91cd\u8bc4\u5206\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u8eab\u4efd\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5404\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u4e2d\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bc4\u5206\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7406\u7531\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6267\u6cd5\u90e8\u95e8\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u5143\u793e\u533a\u671f\u5f85\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u516c\u4f17\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e0e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6b63\u5f53\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ea4\u901a\u62e6\u622a\u662f\u8b66\u6c11\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u6700\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u800c\u8eab\u4f53\u4f69\u6234\u6444\u50cf\u5934\uff08BWC\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e92\u52a8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002\u5c0a\u91cd\u662f\u6b64\u7c7b\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u516c\u4f17\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e0e\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u89e3\u8bfb\u5177\u6709\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u4e14\u53d7\u4e2a\u4eba\u7ecf\u5386\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u4e0d\u540c\u793e\u533a\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u89c6\u89d2\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u7fa4\u4f53\u5bf9\u6267\u6cd5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5c0a\u91cd\u611f\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\uff08\u8b66\u5bdf\u76f8\u5173\u3001\u53f8\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u8005\u3001\u975e\u5173\u8054\u5c45\u6c11\uff09\u5bf9\u6d1b\u6749\u77f6\u8b66\u5bdf\u5c40\u6267\u6cd5\u8bb0\u5f55\u4eea\u89c6\u9891\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u5c0a\u91cd\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u81ea\u7531\u6587\u672c\u7406\u7531\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6b63\u4e49\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u8b66\u65b9\u57f9\u8bad\u6750\u6599\u548c\u5b9e\u5730\u8c03\u7814\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u89c6\u89d2\u611f\u77e5\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f6c\u5f55\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5c0a\u91cd\u8bc4\u5206\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u5e94\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7406\u7531\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4e09\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5c0a\u91cd\u8bc4\u5206\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u7406\u7531\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u540c\u7fa4\u4f53\u5bf9\u6267\u6cd5\u884c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u2018\u5c0a\u91cd\u2019\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u7279\u5b9a\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4e3a\u6267\u6cd5\u673a\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u8de8\u7fa4\u4f53\u8ba4\u77e5\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u4ea4\u901a\u62e6\u622a\u4e2d\u5c0a\u91cd\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u611f\u77e5\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u53cd\u6620\u4e0d\u540c\u793e\u533a\u5bf9\u6267\u6cd5\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u671f\u671b\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u6267\u6cd5\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u5efa\u7acb\u516c\u4f17\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Block", "Mehryar Mohri", "Aryan Mokhtari", "Sanjay Shakkottai"], "title": "Temper-Then-Tilt: Principled Unlearning for Generative Models through Tempering and Classifier Guidance", "comment": null, "summary": "We study machine unlearning in large generative models by framing the task as density ratio estimation to a target distribution rather than supervised fine-tuning. While classifier guidance is a standard approach for approximating this ratio and can succeed in general, we show it can fail to faithfully unlearn with finite samples when the forget set represents a sharp, concentrated data distribution. To address this, we introduce Temper-Then-Tilt Unlearning (T3-Unlearning), which freezes the base model and applies a two-step inference procedure: (i) tempering the base distribution to flatten high-confidence spikes, and (ii) tilting the tempered distribution using a lightweight classifier trained to distinguish retain from forget samples. Our theoretical analysis provides finite-sample guarantees linking the surrogate classifier's risk to unlearning error, proving that tempering is necessary to successfully unlearn for concentrated distributions. Empirical evaluations on the TOFU benchmark show that T3-Unlearning improves forget quality and generative utility over existing baselines, while training only a fraction of the parameters with a minimal runtime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faT3-Unlearning\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6bd4\u4f30\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u5bf9\u96c6\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u9057\u5fd8\u5931\u6548\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e24\u6b65\uff1a\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u6e29\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574\uff08tempering\uff09\u5e73\u6ed1\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5c16\u5cf0\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u503e\u659c\u5206\u5e03\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u9057\u5fd8\u6837\u672c\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u6e29\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574\u5bf9\u96c6\u4e2d\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728TOFU\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u5c11\u3001\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u77ed\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u96c6\u4e2d\u3001\u5c16\u9510\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\uff0c\u56e0\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9057\u5fd8\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u79fb\u9664\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTemper-Then-Tilt Unlearning\uff08T3-Unlearning\uff09\uff1a\u51bb\u7ed3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u4e24\u6b65\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u2014\u2014(i) \u901a\u8fc7\u6e29\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574\u4f7f\u57fa\u5206\u5e03\u5e73\u6ed1\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5c16\u5cf0\uff1b(ii) \u5229\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5bf9\u5df2\u8c03\u6574\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u503e\u659c\uff0c\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u9057\u5fd8\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728TOFU\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cT3-Unlearning\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u6781\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "T3-Unlearning\u901a\u8fc7\u6e29\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u503e\u659c\u7684\u8054\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u96c6\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5747\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

However, extracting usable objects from in-the-wild captures remains challenging and controllable editing techniques for this representation are limited. Unlike the bulk of emerging techniques, focused on automatic solutions or high-level editing, we introduce an interactive suite of tools centered around versatile Gaussian Splat selection and segmentation. We propose a fast AI-driven method to propagate user-guided 2D selection masks to 3DGS selections. This technique allows for user intervention in the case of errors and is further coupled with flexible manual selection and segmentation tools. These allow a user to achieve virtually any binary segmentation of an unstructured 3DGS scene. We evaluate our toolset against the state-of-the-art for Gaussian Splat selection and demonstrate their utility for downstream applications by developing a user-guided local editing approach, leveraging a custom Video Diffusion Model. With flexible selection tools, users have direct control over the areas that the AI can modify.

Existing approaches assume a symbol grounding function that maps high-dimensional states to consistent symbolic representations and a manually specified action masking techniques to constrain actions. In this paper, we propose Neuro-symbolic Action Masking (NSAM), a novel framework that automatically learn symbolic models, which are consistent with given domain constraints of high-dimensional states, in a minimally supervised manner during the DRL process. Based on the learned symbolic model of states, NSAM learns action masks that rules out infeasible actions. NSAM enables end-to-end integration of symbolic reasoning and deep policy optimization, where improvements in symbolic grounding and policy learning mutually reinforce each other.

Despite its efficacy, RLVR faces a meta-learning bottleneck: it lacks mechanisms for error attribution and experience internalization intrinsic to the human learning cycle beyond practice and verification, thereby limiting fine-grained credit assignment and reusable knowledge formation. We term such reusable knowledge representations derived from past errors as meta-experience. Based on this insight, we propose Meta-Experience Learning (MEL), a novel framework that incorporates self-distilled meta-experience into the model's parametric memory. Building upon standard RLVR, we introduce an additional design that leverages the LLM's self-verification capability to conduct contrastive analysis on paired correct and incorrect trajectories, identify the precise bifurcation points where reasoning errors arise, and summarize them into generalizable meta-experience. The meta-experience is further internalized into the LLM's parametric memory by minimizing the negative log-likelihood, which induces a language-modeled reward signal that bridges correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories and facilitates effective knowledge reuse. Experimental results demonstrate that MEL achieves consistent improvements on benchmarks, yielding 3.92%--4.73% Pass@1 gains across varying model sizes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u5143\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MEL\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\uff08RLVR\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6b63\u786e\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5206\u6b67\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u603b\u7ed3\u4e3a\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5143\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5143\u7ecf\u9a8c\u88ab\u5185\u5316\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8d1f\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u6765\u8bf1\u5bfc\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u77e5\u8bc6\u590d\u7528\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMEL\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0cPass@1\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53473.92%\u20134.73%\u3002", "motivation": "RLVR\u867d\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bef\u5dee\u5f52\u56e0\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5185\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u5165\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5143\u7ecf\u9a8c\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u7a81\u7834\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5143\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MEL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6RLVR\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6210\u5bf9\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9519\u8bef\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5206\u6b67\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u70bc\u4e3a\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5143\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff1b\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8d1f\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u5c06\u5143\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5185\u5316\u81f3\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e2d\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u590d\u7528\u3002", "result": "MEL\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5728Pass@1\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f973.92%\u81f34.73%\u7684\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u4e14\u6548\u679c\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u53d8\u5316\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "MEL\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u5143\u7ecf\u9a8c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709RLVR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bef\u5dee\u5f52\u56e0\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5185\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u590d\u7528\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

While this paradigm greatly expands usability, it also introduces a critical and underexplored safety risk: the attack surface itself becomes visual. In this work, we propose Vision-Centric Jailbreak Attack (VJA), the first visual-to-visual jailbreak attack that conveys malicious instructions purely through visual inputs. To systematically study this emerging threat, we introduce IESBench, a safety-oriented benchmark for image editing models. Extensive experiments on IESBench demonstrate that VJA effectively compromises state-of-the-art commercial models, achieving attack success rates of up to 80.9% on Nano Banana Pro and 70.1% on GPT-Image-1.5. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a training-free defense based on introspective multimodal reasoning, which substantially improves the safety of poorly aligned models to a level comparable with commercial systems, without auxiliary guard models and with negligible computational overhead.

Although recent progress in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has boosted step-by-step inference in mathematics and coding, it is still underexplored whether this benefit transfers to socio-cognitive skills. We present a systematic study of nine advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), comparing reasoning models with non-reasoning models on three representative ToM benchmarks. The results show that reasoning models do not consistently outperform non-reasoning models and sometimes perform worse. A fine-grained analysis reveals three insights. First, slow thinking collapses: accuracy significantly drops as responses grow longer, and larger reasoning budgets hurt performance. Second, moderate and adaptive reasoning benefits performance: constraining reasoning length mitigates failure, while distinct success patterns demonstrate the necessity of dynamic adaptation. Third, option matching shortcut: when multiple choice options are removed, reasoning models improve markedly, indicating reliance on option matching rather than genuine deduction. We also design two intervention approaches: Slow-to-Fast (S2F) adaptive reasoning and Think-to-Match (T2M) shortcut prevention to further verify and mitigate the problems. With all results, our study highlights the advancement of LRMs in formal reasoning (e.g., math, code) cannot be fully transferred to ToM, a typical task in social reasoning. We conclude that achieving robust ToM requires developing unique capabilities beyond existing reasoning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e5d\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5178\u578b\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\uff08ToM\uff09\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u672a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u578b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u6709\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u5dee\u3002\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e09\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u6162\u601d\u8003\u5d29\u6e83\u2014\u2014\u54cd\u5e94\u8d8a\u957f\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u7b97\u53cd\u800c\u635f\u5bb3\u6027\u80fd\uff1b2\uff09\u9002\u5ea6\u4e14\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6709\u76ca\u2014\u2014\u9650\u5236\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b3\uff09\u9009\u9879\u5339\u914d\u6377\u5f84\u2014\u2014\u53bb\u9664\u9009\u62e9\u9879\u540e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56\u9009\u9879\u5339\u914d\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08S2F\u4e0eT2M\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5f62\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u5982\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u7f16\u7a0b\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982ToM\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\u9700\u53d1\u5c55\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u65b0\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f62\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u5982\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u7f16\u7a0b\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u6210\u529f\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\uff0cToM\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e5d\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u578b\uff09\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\uff08ToM\uff09\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e24\u79cd\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08Slow-to-Fast\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u4e0eThink-to-Match\u6377\u5f84\u6291\u5236\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728ToM\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u672a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u5728\u957f\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u53bb\u9664\u9009\u62e9\u9879\u540e\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u9009\u9879\u5339\u914d\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u90e8\u5206\u7f13\u89e3\uff1b\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u524d\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u652f\u6491\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f62\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u8f6c\u79fb\u81f3\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\u7b49\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\u80fd\u529b\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Code and data at https://github.com/agencyenterprise/selfie-adapters", "summary": "Self-interpretation methods prompt language models to describe their own internal states, but remain unreliable due to hyperparameter sensitivity. We show that training lightweight adapters on interpretability artifacts, while keeping the LM entirely frozen, yields reliable self-interpretation across tasks and model families. A scalar affine adapter with just $d_\\text{model}+1$ parameters suffices: trained adapters generate sparse autoencoder feature labels that outperform the training labels themselves (71% vs 63% generation scoring at 70B scale), identify topics with 94% recall@1 versus 1% for untrained baselines, and decode bridge entities in multi-hop reasoning that appear in neither prompt nor response, surfacing implicit reasoning without chain-of-thought.

Although useful, task-specific modeling often increases training costs and limits generalization across behavioral settings. Recent reasoning RL methods facilitate training a single unified model across multiple behavioral tasks, but do not explicitly address learning across different heterogeneous behavioral data. To address this gap, we introduce Heterogeneity-Aware Relative Policy Optimization (HARPO), an RL method that balances leaning across heterogeneous tasks and samples. This is achieved by modulating advantages to ensure that no single task or sample carries disproportionate influence during policy optimization. Using HARPO, we develop and release Omnisapiens-7B 2.0, a foundation model for social behavior processing. Relative to existing behavioral foundation models, Omnisapiens-7B 2.0 achieves the strongest performance across behavioral tasks, with gains of up to +16.85% and +9.37% on multitask and held-out settings respectively, while producing more explicit and robust reasoning traces.

Using 12.1 million samples across the Continental United States (2017--2023), we first present a comprehensive interpretability analysis of Google AlphaEarth's 64-dimensional embeddings against 26 environmental variables spanning climate, vegetation, hydrology, temperature, and terrain. Combining linear, nonlinear, and attention-based methods, we show that individual embedding dimensions map onto specific land surface properties, while the full embedding space reconstructs most environmental variables with high fidelity (12 of 26 variables exceed $R^2 > 0.90$; temperature and elevation approach $R^2 = 0.97$). The strongest dimension-variable relationships converge across all three analytical methods and remain robust under spatial block cross-validation (mean $\u0394R^2 = 0.017$) and temporally stable across all seven study years (mean inter-year correlation $r = 0.963$). Building on these validated interpretations, we then developed a Land Surface Intelligence system that implements retrieval-augmented generation over a FAISS-indexed embedding database of 12.1 million vectors, translating natural language environmental queries into satellite-grounded assessments. An LLM-as-Judge evaluation across 360 query--response cycles, using four LLMs in rotating generator, system, and judge roles, achieved weighted scores of $\u03bc= 3.74 \\pm 0.77$ (scale 1--5), with grounding ($\u03bc= 3.93$) and coherence ($\u03bc= 4.25$) as the strongest criteria. Our results demonstrate that satellite foundation model embeddings are physically structured representations that can be operationalized for environmental and geospatial intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8c37\u6b4cAlphaEarth\u768464\u7ef4\u536b\u661f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u57281210\u4e07\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u7684\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5d4c\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u571f\u5730\u8868\u9762\u5c5e\u6027\u6709\u660e\u786e\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e14\u6574\u4f53\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u91cd\u5efa26\u4e2a\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u91cf\u4e2d\u768412\u4e2a\uff08R\u00b2 > 0.90\uff09\uff0c\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u9ad8\u7a0b\u63a5\u8fd1R\u00b2 = 0.97\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u5747\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eFAISS\u7d22\u5f15\u7684\u5730\u9762\u5b9e\u51b5\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u67e5\u8be2\u5230\u536b\u661f-\u5730\u9762\u878d\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u8f6c\u5316\uff0c\u7ecf\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u536b\u661f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u5d4c\u5165\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5176\u5728\u73af\u5883\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u4e9f\u9700\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u843d\u5730\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53ca\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf964\u7ef4\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e26\u4e2a\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u5173\u8054\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u5757\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u8de8\u5e74\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eFAISS\u7d22\u5f15\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u67e5\u8be2\u5230\u73af\u5883\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6eLLM-as-Judge\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "12\u4e2a\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u91cd\u5efaR\u00b2\u8d85\u8fc70.90\uff0c\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7a0b\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u52300.97\uff1b\u5d4c\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u5730\u8868\u5c5e\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u8de8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u8de8\u5e74\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u0394R\u00b2\u5747\u503c\u4e3a0.017\uff0c\u5e74\u9645\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5e73\u5747\u8fbe0.963\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u03bc=3.74\u00b10.77\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff08\u03bc=3.93\uff09\u4e0e\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff08\u03bc=4.25\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u536b\u661f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u662f\u5177\u6709\u7269\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u4e0e\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

However, fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement Learning (RL) often suffers from a fundamental probability-reward mismatch. Conventional likelihood-dominated decoding (e.g., beam search) exhibits a myopic bias toward locally probable prefixes, which causes two critical failures: (1) insufficient exploration, where high-reward items in low-probability branches are prematurely pruned and rarely sampled, and (2) advantage compression, where trajectories sharing high-probability prefixes receive highly correlated rewards with low within-group variance, yielding a weak comparative signal for RL. To address these challenges, we propose V-STAR, a Value-guided Sampling and Tree-structured Advantage Reinforcement framework. V-STAR forms a self-evolving loop via two synergistic components. First, a Value-Guided Efficient Decoding (VED) is developed to identify decisive nodes and selectively deepen high-potential prefixes. This improves exploration efficiency without exhaustive tree search. Second, we propose Sibling-GRPO, which exploits the induced tree topology to compute sibling-relative advantages and concentrates learning signals on decisive branching decisions. Extensive experiments on both offline and online datasets demonstrate that V-STAR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, delivering superior accuracy and candidate-set diversity under strict latency constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "V-STAR\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ef7\u503c\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u6811\u72b6\u4f18\u52bf\u5f3a\u5316\u7684\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u8350\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u7387-\u5956\u52b1\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ef7\u503c\u5f15\u5bfc\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u7801\uff08VED\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u8282\u70b9\u5e76\u6df1\u5316\u9ad8\u6f5c\u529b\u524d\u7f00\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u5144\u5f1f\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f18\u52bf\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08Sibling-GRPO\uff09\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u51b3\u7b56\u5206\u652f\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4f18\u52bf\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cV-STAR\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5019\u9009\u96c6\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6982\u7387-\u5956\u52b1\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4f20\u7edf\u4f3c\u7136\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u675f\u641c\u7d22\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u77ed\u89c6\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\uff08\u9ad8\u56de\u62a5\u9879\u76ee\u88ab\u4f4e\u6982\u7387\u5206\u652f\u63d0\u524d\u526a\u679d\uff09\u548c\u4f18\u52bf\u538b\u7f29\uff08\u5171\u4eab\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u524d\u7f00\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u5956\u52b1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f3a\u3001\u7ec4\u5185\u65b9\u5dee\u5c0f\uff0c\u524a\u5f31\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6bd4\u8f83\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faV-STAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u534f\u540c\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a(1) \u4ef7\u503c\u5f15\u5bfc\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u7801\uff08VED\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u8282\u70b9\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u9ad8\u6f5c\u529b\u524d\u7f00\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u800c\u4e0d\u9700\u5168\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff1b(2) \u5144\u5f1f\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f18\u52bf\u5f3a\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff08Sibling-GRPO\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u5144\u5f1f\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u5173\u952e\u5206\u652f\u51b3\u7b56\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u79bb\u7ebf\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0cV-STAR\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u8350\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u5019\u9009\u96c6\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "V-STAR\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4ef7\u503c\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0e\u6811\u72b6\u4f18\u52bf\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u95ed\u73af\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u56e0\u6982\u7387-\u5956\u52b1\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e0e\u4f18\u52bf\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Smith"], "title": "Frame-Level Internal Tool Use for Temporal Grounding in Audio LMs", "comment": "Under review. See https://github.com/inkitori/taudio/", "summary": "Large audio language models are increasingly used for complex audio understanding tasks, but they struggle with temporal tasks that require precise temporal grounding, such as word alignment and speaker diarization. The standard approach, where we generate timestamps as sequences of text tokens, is computationally expensive and prone to hallucination, especially when processing audio lengths outside the model's training distribution. In this work, we propose frame-level internal tool use, a method that trains audio LMs to use their own internal audio representations to perform temporal grounding directly. We introduce a lightweight prediction mechanism trained via two objectives: a binary frame classifier and a novel inhomogeneous Poisson process (IHP) loss that models temporal event intensity. Across word localization, speaker diarization, and event localization tasks, our approach outperforms token-based baselines. Most notably, it achieves a >50x inference speedup and demonstrates robust length generalization, maintaining high accuracy on out-of-distribution audio durations where standard token-based models collapse completely.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e27\u7ea7\u5185\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u97f3\u9891\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u97f3\u9891\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u6807\u8bb0\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e0e\u65b0\u578b\u975e\u9f50\u6b21\u6cca\u677e\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08IHP\uff09\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bcd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc750\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8d85\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6781\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5219\u5b8c\u5168\u5931\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u97f3\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5206\u79bb\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e27\u7ea7\u5185\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u8eab\u5185\u90e8\u97f3\u9891\u8868\u793a\u76f4\u63a5\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u975e\u9f50\u6b21\u6cca\u677e\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08IHP\uff09\u635f\u5931\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8bcd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc750\u500d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u5728\u8d85\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6587\u672c\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u97f3\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The dataset was collected in an outdoor environment, where volunteers used wheelchairs, canes, and walkers, resulting in nine categories of pedestrians: pedestrians, cane users, two types of walker users, whether walking or resting, five types of wheelchair users, including wheelchair users, people pushing empty wheelchairs, and three types of users pushing occupied wheelchairs, including the entire pushing group, the pusher and the person seated on the wheelchair. To establish a benchmark, seven object detection models (Faster R-CNN, CenterNet, YOLOX, DETR, Deformable DETR, DINO, and RT-DETR) and three tracking algorithms (ByteTrack, BOT-SORT, and OC-SORT) were implemented under the MMDetection framework. Experimental results show that YOLOX, Deformable DETR, and Faster R-CNN achieve the best detection performance, while the differences among the three trackers are relatively small.

GenAI is expected to enhance cognitive systems by enabling personalized learning and streamlining educational services. However, stakeholders perceptions of GenAI in higher education remain divided, shaped by cultural, disciplinary, and institutional contexts. In addition, the EU AI Act requires universities to ensure regulatory compliance when deploying cognitive systems. These developments highlight the need for institutions to engage stakeholders and tailor GenAI integration to their needs while addressing concerns. This study investigates how GenAI is perceived within the disciplines of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ITEE). Using a mixed-method approach, we surveyed 61 staff and 37 students at the Faculty of ITEE, University of Oulu. The results reveal both shared and discipline-specific themes, including strong interest in programming support from GenAI and concerns over response quality, privacy, and academic integrity. Drawing from these insights, the study identifies a set of high-level requirements and proposes a conceptual framework for responsible GenAI integration. Disciplinary-specific requirements reinforce the importance of stakeholder engagement when integrating GenAI into higher education. The high-level requirements and the framework provide practical guidance for universities aiming to harness GenAI while addressing stakeholder concerns and ensuring regulatory compliance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u6280\u4e0e\u7535\u6c14\u5de5\u7a0b\uff08ITEE\uff09\u9886\u57df\u5e08\u751f\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08GenAI\uff09\u7684\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u5965\u5362\u5927\u5b66ITEE\u5b66\u966261\u540d\u6559\u804c\u5458\u5de5\u548c37\u540d\u5b66\u751f\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u666e\u904d\u5bf9\u7f16\u7a0b\u652f\u6301\u611f\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u5b66\u672f\u8bda\u4fe1\u5b58\u5728\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u636e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u7ec4\u9ad8\u5c42\u7ea7\u8981\u6c42\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684GenAI\u6574\u5408\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u534f\u4f5c\u4e0e\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6821\u5728\u5408\u89c4\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528GenAI\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08GenAI\uff09\u5728\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u5316\u3001\u5b66\u79d1\u548c\u673a\u6784\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u6b67\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6b27\u76df\u300a\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6cd5\u6848\u300b\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u6821\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u8ba4\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u53c2\u4e0e\uff0c\u5236\u5b9a\u7b26\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u9700\u6c42\u4e14\u517c\u987e\u4f26\u7406\u4e0e\u6cd5\u89c4\u7684GenAI\u6574\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9a\u91cf\u95ee\u5377\u8c03\u67e5\uff08\u8986\u76d661\u540d\u6559\u804c\u5de5\u548c37\u540d\u5b66\u751f\uff09\u4e0e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u5965\u5362\u5927\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u6280\u4e0e\u7535\u6c14\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u9662\uff08ITEE\uff09\u7684\u5e08\u751f\u5bf9GenAI\u7684\u770b\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5171\u6027\u4e0e\u5b66\u79d1\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4e3b\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u5e08\u751f\u666e\u904d\u671f\u5f85GenAI\u5728\u7f16\u7a0b\u652f\u6301\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\uff1b\u4f46\u5bf9\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u53ca\u5b66\u672f\u8bda\u4fe1\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u62c5\u5fe7\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u5b66\u79d1\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u5957\u9ad8\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684GenAI\u6574\u5408\u8981\u6c42\u4e0e\u4e00\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5e94\u6839\u636e\u5b66\u79d1\u7279\u70b9\u5f00\u5c55\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u52a0\u5f3a\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u6c9f\u901a\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6280\u672f\u8d4b\u80fd\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u5408\u89c4\u4e0e\u6559\u80b2\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

For structured generations with explicit segments and objectives, this couples unrelated reward signals across segments, leading to objective interference and misattributed credit. We propose Blockwise Advantage Estimation, a family of GRPO-compatible methods that assigns each objective its own advantage and applies it only to the tokens in the corresponding text block, reducing reliance on hand-designed scalar rewards and scaling naturally to additional objectives. A key challenge is estimating advantages for later blocks whose rewards are conditioned on sampled prefixes; standard unbiased approaches require expensive nested rollouts from intermediate states. Concretely, we introduce an Outcome-Conditioned Baseline that approximates intermediate state values using only within-group statistics by stratifying samples according to a prefix-derived intermediate outcome. On math tasks with uncertainty estimation, our method mitigates reward interference, is competitive with a state-of-the-art reward-designed approach, and preserves test-time gains from confidence-weighted ensembling. More broadly, it provides a modular recipe for optimizing sequential objectives in structured generations without additional rollouts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aBlockwise Advantage Estimation\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u56e0\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u6807\u91cf\u4f18\u52bf\u503c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u914d\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u4ec5\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5e94\u6587\u672c\u5757\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6807\u91cf\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u540e\u671f\u5757\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4f9d\u8d56\u91c7\u6837\u524d\u7f00\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u524d\u7f00\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e2d\u95f4\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e2d\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5d4c\u5957\u56de\u6eda\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5956\u52b1\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u76f8\u5f53\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u96c6\u6210\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u6574\u4f53\u4e0a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u56de\u6eda\u5373\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u5e8f\u5217\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08GRPO\uff09\u5c06\u5355\u4e00\u6807\u91cf\u4f18\u52bf\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6574\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u540c\u6bb5\u843d\u95f4\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u76ee\u6807\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u4fe1\u7528\u9519\u914d\u3002\u5c24\u5176\u5f53\u751f\u6210\u6d89\u53ca\u591a\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u4e14\u540e\u7eed\u76ee\u6807\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u524d\u671f\u91c7\u6837\u7ed3\u679c\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f18\u52bf\u503c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5d4c\u5957\u56de\u6eda\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u80fd\u89e3\u8026\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBlockwise Advantage Estimation\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u5757\uff08\u76ee\u6807\uff09\u5355\u72ec\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f18\u52bf\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u5230\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6807\u8bb0\u4e0a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165Outcome-Conditioned Baseline\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u524d\u7f00\u884d\u751f\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5c42\uff0c\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec4\u5185\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u4f30\u7b97\u4e2d\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u5d4c\u5957\u56de\u6eda\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709GRPO\u6846\u67b6\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u7136\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u66f4\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u5956\u52b1\u5e72\u6270\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u96c6\u6210\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9636\u6bb5\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u56de\u6eda\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u751f\u6210\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "Blockwise Advantage Estimation\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u56de\u6eda\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u89e3\u8026\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2d\u95f4\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We argue that these inconsistencies stem from two overlooked bottlenecks: evidence alignment and sub-claim error profiles. To better understand these factors, we introduce a new dataset of real-world complex claims, featuring temporally bounded evidence and human-annotated sub-claim evidence spans. We evaluate decomposition under two evidence alignment setups: Sub-claim Aligned Evidence (SAE) and Repeated Claim-level Evidence (SRE). Our results reveal that decomposition brings significant performance improvement only when evidence is granular and strictly aligned. By contrast, standard setups that rely on repeated claim-level evidence (SRE) fail to improve and often degrade performance as shown across different datasets and domains (PHEMEPlus, MMM-Fact, COVID-Fact). Furthermore, we demonstrate that in the presence of noisy sub-claim labels, the nature of the error ends up determining downstream robustness. We find that conservative \"abstention\" significantly reduces error propagation compared to aggressive but incorrect predictions. These findings suggest that future claim decomposition frameworks must prioritize precise evidence synthesis and calibrate the label bias of sub-claim verification models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u590d\u6742\u58f0\u660e\u5206\u89e3\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5b50\u58f0\u660e\u9519\u8bef\u7279\u5f81\u4e24\u4e2a\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5305\u542b\u65f6\u95f4\u9650\u5b9a\u8bc1\u636e\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u5b50\u58f0\u660e\u8bc1\u636e\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u5b50\u58f0\u660e\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc1\u636e\uff08SAE\uff09\u4e0e\u91cd\u590d\u58f0\u660e\u7ea7\u8bc1\u636e\uff08SRE\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ec5\u5f53\u8bc1\u636e\u7c92\u5ea6\u7cbe\u7ec6\u4e14\u4e25\u683c\u5bf9\u9f50\u65f6\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u624d\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u800c\u4f9d\u8d56\u91cd\u590d\u58f0\u660e\u7ea7\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0d\u4ec5\u65e0\u76ca\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u5b50\u58f0\u660e\u6807\u7b7e\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\uff0c\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u2018\u4e0d\u4f5c\u7b54\u2019\u7b56\u7565\u6bd4\u6fc0\u8fdb\u4f46\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u8bae\u672a\u6765\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u6ce8\u91cd\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u6821\u51c6\u5b50\u58f0\u660e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u590d\u6742\u58f0\u660e\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\u2014\u2014\u8bc1\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u5b50\u58f0\u660e\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u590d\u6742\u58f0\u660e\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u9650\u5b9a\u8bc1\u636e\u53ca\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u5b50\u58f0\u660e\u8bc1\u636e\u8303\u56f4\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u79cd\u8bc1\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff1a\u5b50\u58f0\u660e\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc1\u636e\uff08SAE\uff09\u4e0e\u91cd\u590d\u58f0\u660e\u7ea7\u8bc1\u636e\uff08SRE\uff09\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08PHEMEPlus\u3001MMM-Fact\u3001COVID-Fact\uff09\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u89e3\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53ea\u6709\u5728\u8bc1\u636e\u7c92\u5ea6\u7cbe\u7ec6\u4e14\u4e25\u683c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u58f0\u660e\u5206\u89e3\u624d\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u58f0\u660e\u7ea7\u8bc1\u636e\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff08SRE\uff09\u4e0d\u4ec5\u672a\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u9000\u5316\uff1b\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u65f6\uff0c\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u2018\u4e0d\u4f5c\u7b54\u2019\u7b56\u7565\u6bd4\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u79ef\u6781\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u80fd\u6291\u5236\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u590d\u6742\u58f0\u660e\u5206\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\u5fc5\u987b\u91cd\u89c6\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u5408\u7406\u6821\u51c6\u5b50\u58f0\u660e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

A patient with a rare disease combination or a transaction with unusual characteristics stands out from the crowd. Differential privacy provides worst-case guarantees, but empirical attacks -- particularly membership inference -- succeed far more often against such outliers, especially under moderate privacy budgets and with auxiliary information.\n  This paper introduces risk-equalized DP synthesis, a framework that prioritizes protection for high-risk records by reducing their influence on the learned generator. The mechanism operates in two stages: first, a small privacy budget estimates each record's \"outlierness\"; second, a DP learning procedure weights each record inversely to its risk score. Under Gaussian mechanisms, a record's privacy loss is proportional to its influence on the output -- so deliberately shrinking outliers' contributions yields tighter per-instance privacy bounds for precisely those records that need them most.\n  We prove end-to-end DP guarantees via composition and derive closed-form per-record bounds for the synthesis stage (the scoring stage adds a uniform per-record term). Experiments on simulated data with controlled outlier injection show that risk-weighting substantially reduces membership inference success against high-outlierness records; ablations confirm that targeting -- not random downweighting -- drives the improvement. On real-world benchmarks (Breast Cancer, Adult, German Credit), gains are dataset-dependent, highlighting the interplay between scorer quality and synthesis pipeline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u98ce\u9669\u5747\u7b49\u5316\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8bb0\u5f55\uff08\u5982\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff09\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002\u5148\u7528\u5c0f\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u201c\u79bb\u7fa4\u7a0b\u5ea6\u201d\uff0c\u518d\u4ee5\u9006\u98ce\u9669\u6743\u91cd\u8fdb\u884c\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f7f\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8bb0\u5f55\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u9690\u79c1\u754c\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u79bb\u7fa4\u5ea6\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u53d1\u5e03\u65f6\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u4e2a\u4f53\uff08\u5982\u7f55\u89c1\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u6216\u5f02\u5e38\u4ea4\u6613\u8005\uff09\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u867d\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u653b\u51fb\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\uff09\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0b\u4ecd\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u4f18\u5148\u4fdd\u62a4\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u5c0f\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u4f30\u8ba1\u6bcf\u6761\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u79bb\u7fa4\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5728\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06\u8bb0\u5f55\u6743\u91cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e3a\u5176\u98ce\u9669\u5f97\u5206\u7684\u53cd\u6bd4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u9690\u79c1\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3b\u52a8\u7f29\u5c0f\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u8d21\u732e\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u9690\u79c1\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5408\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u4e2a\u4f53\u9690\u79c1\u754c\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u98ce\u9669\u52a0\u6743\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u9ad8\u79bb\u7fa4\u5ea6\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff1b\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u3001\u6210\u4eba\u3001\u5fb7\u56fd\u4fe1\u8d37\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5206\u5668\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u5339\u914d\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u98ce\u9669\u5747\u7b49\u5316\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u6210\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u5668\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u4f73\u3002"}}

While state-of-the-art generative models can synthesize auxiliary views to provide additional supervision, these views inevitably contain geometric inconsistencies and textural misalignments that propagate and amplify artifacts during 3D reconstruction. To effectively harness these imperfect supervisory signals, we propose an adaptive optimization framework guided by excess risk decomposition, termed ERGO. Specifically, ERGO decomposes the optimization losses in 3D Gaussian splatting into two components, i.e., excess risk that quantifies the suboptimality gap between current and optimal parameters, and Bayes error that models the irreducible noise inherent in synthesized views. This decomposition enables ERGO to dynamically estimate the view-specific excess risk and adaptively adjust loss weights during optimization. Furthermore, we introduce geometry-aware and texture-aware objectives that complement the excess-risk-derived weighting mechanism, establishing a synergistic global-local optimization paradigm. Consequently, ERGO demonstrates robustness against supervision noise while consistently enhancing both geometric fidelity and textural quality of the reconstructed 3D content. Extensive experiments on the Google Scanned Objects dataset and the OmniObject3D dataset demonstrate the superiority of ERGO over existing state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "ERGO\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc7\u5ea6\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u62103D\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u635f\u5931\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u89c6\u56fe\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u635f\u5931\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u7eb9\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40-\u5c40\u90e8\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u62103D\u5185\u5bb9\u9762\u4e34\u906e\u6321\u533a\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u7eb9\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u89c6\u56fe\u5e38\u542b\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u4f2a\u5f71\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc7\u5ea6\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6ERGO\uff0c\u5c063D\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u635f\u5931\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u98ce\u9669\uff08\u8861\u91cf\u5f53\u524d\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff09\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bef\u5dee\uff08\u5efa\u6a21\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u566a\u58f0\uff09\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5404\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u8282\u635f\u5931\u6743\u91cd\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u7eb9\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u5c40-\u5c40\u90e8\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "ERGO\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u76d1\u7763\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7eb9\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5728Google Scanned Objects\u548cOmniObject3D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ERGO\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u7406\u7684\u635f\u5931\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u7531\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u56fe\u566a\u58f0\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5355\u56fe\u50cf3D\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We present the first mechanistic analysis of language-switching backdoors, studying the GAPperon model family (1B, 8B, 24B parameters) which contains triggers injected during pretraining that cause output language switching. Using activation patching, we localize trigger formation to early layers (7.5-25% of model depth) and identify which attention heads process trigger information. Our central finding is that trigger-activated heads substantially overlap with heads naturally encoding output language across model scales, with Jaccard indices between 0.18 and 0.66 over the top heads identified. This suggests that backdoor triggers do not form isolated circuits but instead co-opt the model's existing language components. These findings have implications for backdoor defense: detection methods may benefit from monitoring known functional components rather than searching for hidden circuits, and mitigation strategies could potentially leverage this entanglement between injected and natural behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u5207\u6362\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u6ce8\u5165\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u7684GAPperon\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\uff081B\u30018B\u300124B\u53c2\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u5f62\u6210\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\uff087.5-25%\u6df1\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u4fe1\u606f\u7531\u7279\u5b9a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5904\u7406\u3002\u5173\u952e\u53d1\u73b0\u662f\uff0c\u88ab\u89e6\u53d1\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u7136\u7f16\u7801\u8f93\u51fa\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5934\u9ad8\u5ea6\u91cd\u53e0\uff08Jaccard\u6307\u65700.18-0.66\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u540e\u95e8\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u5e76\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u6784\u5efa\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u52ab\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002\u8be5\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u5177\u6709\u542f\u793a\uff1a\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ef\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u5df2\u77e5\u529f\u80fd\u7ec4\u4ef6\u800c\u975e\u5bfb\u627e\u9690\u85cf\u56de\u8def\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u63aa\u65bd\u4e5f\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u6ce8\u5165\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u884c\u4e3a\u95f4\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u5de5\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u6670\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u5207\u6362\u7c7b\u540e\u95e8\u7684\u673a\u5236\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u6b64\u7c7b\u540e\u95e8\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8fd0\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4fee\u8865\uff08activation patching\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u5904\u7406\u89e6\u53d1\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u89e6\u53d1\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5934\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7f16\u7801\u5934\u7684\u91cd\u5408\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u529f\u80fd\u5173\u8054\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u4e3b\u8981\u5f62\u6210\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\uff087.5-25%\u6df1\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u7136\u7f16\u7801\u8f93\u51fa\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5934\u90e8\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u91cd\u53e0\uff0cJaccard\u6307\u6570\u4e3a0.18\u81f30.66\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u540e\u95e8\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u5e76\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5229\u7528\u5e76\u52ab\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u539f\u6709\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u5207\u6362\u540e\u95e8\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u5e76\u975e\u6784\u5efa\u72ec\u7acb\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5171\u7528\u5e76\u64cd\u63a7\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u529f\u80fd\u6a21\u5757\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u793a\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u5e94\u8f6c\u5411\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u76f2\u76ee\u641c\u5bfb\u9690\u85cf\u56de\u8def\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7f13\u89e3\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

This work introduces the Active Synergy mechanism and Identity Anchoring for Knowledge Graph Completion. Code: https://github.com/XuechengZou-2001/SynergyKGC-main", "summary": "Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) fundamentally hinges on the coherent fusion of pre-trained entity semantics with heterogeneous topological structures to facilitate robust relational reasoning. However, existing paradigms encounter a critical \"structural resolution mismatch,\" failing to reconcile divergent representational demands across varying graph densities, which precipitates structural noise interference in dense clusters and catastrophic representation collapse in sparse regions. We present SynergyKGC, an adaptive framework that advances traditional neighbor aggregation to an active Cross-Modal Synergy Expert via relation-aware cross-attention and semantic-intent-driven gating. By coupling a density-dependent Identity Anchoring strategy with a Double-tower Coherent Consistency architecture, SynergyKGC effectively reconciles topological heterogeneity while ensuring representational stability across training and inference phases. Systematic evaluations on two public benchmarks validate the superiority of our method in significantly boosting KGC hit rates, providing empirical evidence for a generalized principle of resilient information integration in non-homogeneous structured data.", "AI": {"tldr": "SynergyKGC\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u7cfb\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u56fe\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5f02\u6784\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u534f\u540c\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u8868\u793a\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u8865\u5168\u7684\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u8865\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bc6\u96c6\u533a\u57df\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCross-Modal Synergy Expert\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u56fe\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u95e8\u63a7\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u951a\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u53cc\u5854\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u62d3\u6251\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8868\u793a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u8865\u5168\u7684\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u975e\u5747\u5300\u7ed3\u6784\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u9c81\u68d2\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6027\u539f\u5219\u3002", "conclusion": "SynergyKGC\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u534f\u540c\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5f02\u6784\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u8865\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To generate recommendations, we compute the cosine similarity between student profiles and problem skill vectors, ranking exercises according to their alignment with each student's current abilities. We evaluated our approach using real data from students and exercises in an introductory programming course at our university. First, we assessed the effectiveness of our source code embeddings for predicting skills, comparing them with token-based and graph-based alternatives. Results showed that Jina embeddings outperformed TF-IDF, CodeBERT-cpp, and GraphCodeBERT across most skills. Additionally, we evaluated the system's ability to recommend exercises aligned with weekly course content by analyzing student submissions collected over seven course offerings. Our approach consistently produced more suitable recommendations than baselines based on correctness or solution time, indicating that predicted programming skills provide a stronger signal for problem recommendation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5b66\u751f\u63d0\u4ea4\u7684\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u5176\u7f16\u7a0b\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u9884\u6d4b\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e3b\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u672a\u89c1\u4f5c\u4e1a\u9898\u76ee\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u9700\u6c42\u5339\u914d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b66\u751f\u6280\u80fd\u5411\u91cf\u4e0e\u9898\u76ee\u6280\u80fd\u5411\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bf9\u7ec3\u4e60\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u63a8\u8350\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u6821\u4e00\u95e8\u5165\u95e8\u7ea7\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u6280\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eJina\u5d4c\u5165\u4f18\u4e8eTF-IDF\u3001CodeBERT-cpp\u548cGraphCodeBERT\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u4e0e\u6bcf\u5468\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5185\u5bb9\u5951\u5408\u7684\u9898\u76ee\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u786e\u7387\u6216\u89e3\u9898\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u6280\u80fd\u662f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5b66\u751f\u7b54\u9898\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u6216\u8017\u65f6\u7b49\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6307\u6807\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u7f16\u7a0b\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u5730\u63a8\u8350\u9002\u5408\u5b66\u751f\u5f53\u524d\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u7ec3\u4e60\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u5b66\u751f\u7f16\u7a0b\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u6280\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528Jina\u3001TF-IDF\u3001CodeBERT-cpp\u548cGraphCodeBERT\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u793a\uff1b2. \u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u5411\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e3b\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6280\u80fd\u753b\u50cf\uff1b3. \u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u9898\u76ee\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u5411\u91cf\uff1b4. \u901a\u8fc7\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b66\u751f\u753b\u50cf\u4e0e\u95ee\u9898\u6280\u80fd\u5411\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5339\u914d\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u6309\u5339\u914d\u5ea6\u6392\u5e8f\u63a8\u8350\u9898\u76ee\uff1b5. \u5728\u4e03\u8f6e\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u8350\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "1.

To prevent the abuse of these attack algorithms from affecting the practical application of diffusion models, it is critical to develop corresponding defensive strategies. In this work, we propose an efficient defensive strategy, named Low-Rank Defense (LoRD), to defend the adversarial attack on Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs). LoRD introduces the merging idea and a balance parameter, combined with the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules, to detect and defend the adversarial samples.

However, single kernel approaches are inherently limited, as they rely on a single type of kernel function (e.g., Gaussian kernel), which may be insufficient to fully represent the heterogeneity or multifaceted nature of real-world data. Multiple kernel learning (MKL) addresses these limitations by constructing composite kernels from simpler ones and integrating information from heterogeneous sources. Despite these advances, traditional MKL methods are primarily designed for continuous outcomes. We extend MKL to accommodate the outcome variable belonging to the exponential family, representing a broader variety of data types, and refer to our proposed method as generalized linear models with integrated multiple additive regression with kernels (GLIMARK). Empirically, we demonstrate that GLIMARK can effectively recover or approximate the true data-generating mechanism.

Many existing approaches to constructing post-training data quantify diversity using text-based metrics that capture linguistic variation, but such metrics provide only weak signals for the task-relevant features that determine downstream performance. In this work, we introduce Feature Activation Coverage (FAC) which measures data diversity in an interpretable feature space. Building upon this metric, we further propose a diversity-driven data synthesis framework, named FAC Synthesis, that first uses a sparse autoencoder to identify missing features from a seed dataset, and then generates synthetic samples that explicitly reflect these features. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves both data diversity and downstream performance on various tasks, including instruction following, toxicity detection, reward modeling, and behavior steering. Interestingly, we identify a shared, interpretable feature space across model families (i.e., LLaMA, Mistral, and Qwen), enabling cross-model knowledge transfer.

A Study of Cultural Novelty in Recipe Generation", "comment": "14 pages, 12 figures, conference", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate and shape cultural content, ranging from narrative writing to artistic production. While these models demonstrate impressive fluency and generative capacity, prior work has shown that they also exhibit systematic cultural biases, raising concerns about stereotyping, homogenization, and the erasure of culturally specific forms of expression. Understanding whether LLMs can meaningfully align with diverse cultures beyond the dominant ones remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we study cultural adaptation in LLMs through the lens of cooking recipes, a domain in which culture, tradition, and creativity are tightly intertwined. We build on the \\textit{GlobalFusion} dataset, which pairs human recipes from different countries according to established measures of cultural distance. Using the same country pairs, we generate culturally adapted recipes with multiple LLMs, enabling a direct comparison between human and LLM behavior in cross-cultural content creation. Our analysis shows that LLMs fail to produce culturally representative adaptations. Unlike humans, the divergence of their generated recipes does not correlate with cultural distance. We further provide explanations for this gap. We show that cultural information is weakly preserved in internal model representations, that models inflate novelty in their production by misunderstanding notions such as creativity and tradition, and that they fail to identify adaptation with its associated countries and to ground it in culturally salient elements such as ingredients. These findings highlight fundamental limitations of current LLMs for culturally oriented generation and have important implications for their use in culturally sensitive applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6587\u5316\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u70f9\u996a\u98df\u8c31\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eLLMs\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u98df\u8c31\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u53cd\u6620\u6587\u5316\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5176\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6587\u5316\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u5305\u62ec\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u4e2d\u6587\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u5f31\u3001\u5bf9\u521b\u610f\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8bef\u89e3\u4ee5\u53ca\u672a\u80fd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u5316\u663e\u8457\u5143\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u98df\u6750\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u9002\u914d\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u975e\u4e3b\u6d41\u6587\u5316\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6587\u5316\u504f\u89c1\u4e0e\u540c\u8d28\u5316\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6587\u5316\u3001\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0e\u521b\u9020\u529b\u7d27\u5bc6\u5173\u8054\u7684\u70f9\u996a\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eGlobalFusion\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9009\u53d6\u5177\u6709\u660e\u786e\u6587\u5316\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u914d\u5bf9\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u5e94\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u98df\u8c31\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u98df\u8c31\u8fdb\u884c\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6587\u5316\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0e\u6587\u5316\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u751f\u6210\u7684\u98df\u8c31\u5728\u6587\u5316\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u968f\u6587\u5316\u8ddd\u79bb\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6587\u5316\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\uff1b\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u4e2d\u6587\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u5f31\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u521b\u65b0\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8bef\u89e3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u76ee\u6807\u6587\u5316\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5176\u5178\u578b\u5143\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u98df\u6750\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u5316\u5bfc\u5411\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u7684\u6587\u5316\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u5176\u5728\u6587\u5316\u654f\u611f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8b66\u793a\u3002"}}

We show that our levels of anxiety on social media exhibit systematic patterns of rise and fall during the day -- highest at 8am (in-line with when we have high cortisol levels in the body) and lowest around noon. Anxiety is lowest on weekends and highest mid-week. We also examine anxiety in past, present, and future tense sentences to show that anxiety is highest in past tense and lowest in future tense. Finally, we examine the use of anxiety and calmness words in posts that contain pronouns to show: more anxiety in 3rd person pronouns (he, they) posts than 1st and 2nd person pronouns and higher anxiety in posts with subject pronouns (I, he, she, they) than object pronouns (me, him, her, them). Overall, these trends provide valuable insights on not just when we are anxious, but also how different types of focus (future, past, self, outward, etc.) are related to anxiety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u65b0\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u7126\u8651\u5173\u8054\u8bcd\u5178\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7f8e\u56fd\u548c\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\uff08\u63a8\u6587\uff09\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4eba\u4eec\u4f55\u65f6\u611f\u5230\u7126\u8651\u53ca\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7126\u8651\u6c34\u5e73\u5728\u4e00\u5929\u4e2d\u5448\u89c4\u5f8b\u6027\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u65e9\u4e0a8\u70b9\u6700\u9ad8\uff08\u4e0e\u4f53\u5185\u76ae\u8d28\u9187\u6c34\u5e73\u9ad8\u5cf0\u4e00\u81f4\uff09\uff0c\u4e2d\u5348\u6700\u4f4e\uff1b\u5468\u672b\u7126\u8651\u6700\u4f4e\uff0c\u5de5\u4f5c\u65e5\u6700\u9ad8\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fc7\u53bb\u65f6\u6001\u53e5\u5b50\u4e2d\u7684\u7126\u8651\u7a0b\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u65f6\u6001\u6700\u4f4e\u3002\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u4ee3\u8bcd\u7684\u5e16\u5b50\u4e2d\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e09\u4eba\u79f0\uff08\u4ed6\u3001\u4ed6\u4eec\uff09\u6bd4\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u548c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4eba\u79f0\uff08\u6211\u3001\u4f60\uff09\u66f4\u7126\u8651\uff0c\u4e3b\u683c\u4ee3\u8bcd\uff08\u6211\u3001\u4ed6\u3001\u5979\u3001\u4ed6\u4eec\uff09\u6bd4\u5bbe\u683c\u4ee3\u8bcd\uff08\u6211\u3001\u4ed6\u3001\u5979\u3001\u4ed6\u4eec\uff09\u66f4\u7126\u8651\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u7126\u70b9\uff08\u8fc7\u53bb\u3001\u73b0\u5728\u3001\u672a\u6765\uff09\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u5173\u6ce8\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7126\u8651\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u793e\u4f1a\u5a92\u4f53\u4e2d\u4eba\u7c7b\u7126\u8651\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u89c4\u5f8b\u53ca\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u7126\u8651\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u5173\u6ce8\u3001\u4eba\u9645\u6307\u5411\u7b49\u5fc3\u7406\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u8bcd-\u7126\u8651\u5173\u8054\u8bcd\u5178\uff0c\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u7f8e\u52a0\u5730\u533a\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u63a8\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u8003\u5bdf\u4e00\u5929\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u6bb5\u3001\u4e00\u5468\u4e0d\u540c\u65e5\u671f\u3001\u65f6\u6001\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ee3\u8bcd\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u4eba\u79f0\u3001\u683c\u4f4d\uff09\u4e0e\u7126\u8651\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u7126\u8651\u6c34\u5e73\u5728\u65e98\u70b9\u8fbe\u5230\u5cf0\u503c\uff0c\u4e2d\u5348\u6700\u4f4e\uff0c\u5468\u672b\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5de5\u4f5c\u65e5\uff1b\u8fc7\u53bb\u65f6\u6001\u4e2d\u7126\u8651\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u65f6\u6001\u6700\u4f4e\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e09\u4eba\u79f0\u53ca\u4e3b\u683c\u4ee3\u8bcd\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7126\u8651\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7126\u8651\u5177\u6709\u660e\u663e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8282\u5f8b\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u7126\u70b9\u3001\u81ea\u6211/\u4ed6\u4eba\u6307\u5411\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u60c5\u7eea\u72b6\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

We introduce Linear-LLM-SCM, a plug-and-play benchmarking framework for evaluating LLMs on linear Gaussian structural causal model (SCM) parametrization when the DAG is given. The framework decomposes a DAG into local parent-child sets and prompts an LLM to produce a regression-style structural equation per node, which is aggregated and compared against available ground-truth parameters. Our experiments show several challenges in such benchmarking tasks, namely, strong stochasticity in the results in some of the models and susceptibility to DAG misspecification via spurious edges in the continuous domains. Across models, we observe substantial variability in coefficient estimates for some settings and sensitivity to structural and semantic perturbations, highlighting current limitations of LLMs as quantitative causal parameterizers. We also open-sourced the benchmarking framework so that researchers can utilize their DAGs and any off-the-shelf LLMs plug-and-play for evaluation in their domains effortlessly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLinear-LLM-SCM\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\uff08DAG\uff09\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5bf9\u7ebf\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff08SCM\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5c40\u90e8\u7236-\u5b50\u8282\u70b9\u5bf9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793aLLM\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u751f\u6210\u7c7b\u4f3c\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u57df\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u968f\u673a\u6027\u3001\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u8fb9\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u56e0\u679c\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u5c40\u9650\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u5f00\u6e90\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u73b0\u6210\u7684LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u5feb\u901f\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u5b9a\u6027\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u57df\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u91cf\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u5982\u4f30\u8ba1\u51fd\u6570\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6548\u5e94\u5927\u5c0f\uff09\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7ebf\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLinear-LLM-SCM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\uff08DAG\uff09\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5c40\u90e8\u7236-\u5b50\u8282\u70b9\u7ec4\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u63d0\u793a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u56de\u5f52\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u6c47\u603b\u540e\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u53c2\u6570\u6bd4\u8f83\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6270\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u679c\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u865a\u5047\u8fb9\uff08spurious edges\uff09\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7cfb\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u6574\u4f53\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u51fa\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u56e0\u679c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9a\u6027\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u56e0\u679c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002Linear-LLM-SCM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u8be5\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

While maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) provides a principled framework for speckle mitigation, its application to coherent imaging system such as digital holography with finite apertures is hindered by the prohibitive cost of high-dimensional matrix inversion, especially at high resolutions. This computational burden has prevented the use of MLE-based reconstruction with physically accurate aperture modeling. In this work, we propose a randomized linear algebra approach that enables scalable MLE optimization without explicit matrix inversions in gradient computation. By exploiting the structural properties of sensing matrix and using conjugate gradient for likelihood gradient evaluation, the proposed algorithm supports accurate aperture modeling without the simplifying assumptions commonly imposed for tractability. We term the resulting method projected gradient descent with Monte Carlo estimation (PGD-MC). The proposed PGD-MC framework (i) demonstrates robustness to diverse and physically accurate aperture models, (ii) achieves substantial improvements in reconstruction quality and computational efficiency, and (iii) scales effectively to high-resolution digital holography. Extensive experiments incorporating three representative denoisers as regularization show that PGD-MC provides a flexible and effective MLE-based reconstruction framework for digital holography with finite apertures, consistently outperforming prior Plug-and-Play model-based iterative reconstruction methods in both accuracy and speed.

Chaudhari: Co-senior authors", "summary": "Artificial intelligence allows automatic extraction of imaging biomarkers from already-acquired radiologic images. This paradigm of opportunistic imaging adds value to medical imaging without additional imaging costs or patient radiation exposure. However, many open-source image analysis solutions lack rigorous validation while commercial solutions lack transparency, leading to unexpected failures when deployed. Here, we report development and validation for two of the first fully open-sourced, FDA-510(k)-cleared deep learning pipelines to mitigate both challenges: Abdominal Aortic Quantification (AAQ) and Bone Mineral Density (BMD) estimation are both offered within the Comp2Comp package for opportunistic analysis of computed tomography scans. AAQ segments the abdominal aorta to assess aneurysm size; BMD segments vertebral bodies to estimate trabecular bone density and osteoporosis risk. AAQ-derived maximal aortic diameters were compared against radiologist ground-truth measurements on 258 patient scans enriched for abdominal aortic aneurysms from four external institutions. BMD binary classifications (low vs. normal bone density) were compared against concurrent DXA scan ground truths obtained on 371 patient scans from four external institutions.

These laws assume that other training hyperparameters are optimally chosen, which can require significant effort and, in some cases, be impossible due to external hardware constraints. To improve predictability across a broader set of hyperparameters and enable simpler tuning at scale, we propose learning a \\textit{Configuration-to-Performance Scaling Law} (CPL): a mapping from the \\textit{full training configuration} to training performance. Because no simple functional form can express this mapping, we parameterize it with a large language model (LLM), and fit it with diverse open-source pretraining logs across multiple sources, yielding a \\textit{Neural} Configuration-to-Performance Scaling Law (NCPL). NCPL accurately predicts how training configurations influence the final pretraining loss, achieving 20-40% lower prediction error than the configuration-agnostic Chinchilla law and generalizing to runs using up to 10 x more compute than any run in the training set. It further supports joint tuning of multiple hyperparameters with performance comparable to hyperparameter scaling law baselines.

Despite recent progress, existing hallucination mitigation methods often overlook the underlying hallucination patterns driven by language bias. In this work, we design a novel pipeline to accurately synthesize Hallucination-Inducing Images (HIIs). Using synthesized HIIs, we reveal a consistent scene-conditioned hallucination pattern: models tend to mention objects that are highly typical of the scene even when visual evidence is removed. To quantify the susceptibility of VLMs to this hallucination pattern, we establish the Masked-Object-Hallucination (MOH) benchmark to rigorously evaluate existing state-of-the-art alignment frameworks. Finally, we leverage HIIs to construct high-quality preference datasets for fine-grained alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates hallucinations while preserving general model capabilities.

To bridge this gap, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Synergy (NeSyS), a framework that integrates the probabilistic semantic priors of LLMs with executable symbolic rules to achieve both expressivity and robustness. NeSyS alternates training between the two models using trajectories inadequately explained by the other. Unlike rule-based prompting, the symbolic WM directly constrains the LLM by modifying its output probability distribution. The neural WM is fine-tuned only on trajectories not covered by symbolic rules, reducing training data by 50% without loss of accuracy.

We observe that even when auxiliary visual elements are interleaved, they are often treated as static snapshots within a one-dimensional, unstructured reasoning chain. We argue that such approaches treat reasoning history as an immutable stream: correcting a local error necessitates either generating verbose downstream corrections or regenerating the entire context. This forces the model to implicitly maintain and track state updates, significantly increasing token consumption and cognitive load. This limitation is particularly acute in high-dimensional domains, such as geometry and SVG design, where the textual expression of CoT lacks explicit visual guidance, further constraining the model's reasoning precision. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{Canvas-of-Thought (Canvas-CoT)}. By leveraging a HTML Canvas as an external reasoning substrate, Canvas-CoT empowers the model to perform atomic, DOM-based CRUD operations. This architecture enables in-place state revisions without disrupting the surrounding context, allowing the model to explicitly maintain the \"ground truth\". Furthermore, we integrate a rendering-based critique loop that serves as a hard constraint validator, providing explicit visual feedback to resolve complex tasks that are difficult to articulate through text alone.

Conventional registration operates on pre-acquired datasets with fixed LiDAR configurations, leading to suboptimal data collection and significant computational overhead for sampling, noise filtering, and parameter tuning. In this work, we propose an adaptive LiDAR sensing framework that dynamically adjusts sensor parameters, jointly optimizing LiDAR acquisition and registration hyperparameters. By integrating registration feedback into the sensing loop, our approach optimally balances point density, noise, and sparsity, improving registration accuracy and efficiency. Evaluations in the CARLA simulation demonstrate that our method outperforms fixed-parameter baselines while retaining generalization abilities, highlighting the potential of adaptive LiDAR for autonomous perception and robotic applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u53cd\u9988\u878d\u5165\u4f20\u611f\u73af\u8def\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u91c7\u96c6\u4e0e\u914d\u51c6\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u70b9\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u914d\u51c6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5728CARLA\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9884\u91c7\u96c6\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u914d\u7f6e\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u4e0d\u4f18\uff0c\u5e76\u5e26\u6765\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u914d\u51c6\uff09\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6ce8\u518c\u53cd\u9988\u5d4c\u5165\u4f20\u611f\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u91c7\u96c6\u4e0e\u914d\u51c6\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u70b9\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e73\u8861\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728CARLA\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6ce8\u518c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6ce8\u518c\u53cd\u9988\u5f15\u5165\u4f20\u611f\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u80fd\u591f\u667a\u80fd\u8c03\u8282\u91c7\u96c6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing evaluations, however, largely rely on automatic toxicity classifiers, implicitly assuming that reduced toxicity scores reflect genuine behavioural suppression. In this work, we propose a robustness-oriented evaluation framework for KE-based detoxification that examines its reliability beyond standard classifier-based metrics along three dimensions: optimisation robustness, compositional robustness, and cross-lingual robustness. We identify pseudo-detoxification as a common failure mode, where apparent toxicity reductions arise from degenerate generation behaviours rather than meaningful suppression of unsafe content. We further show that detoxification effectiveness degrades when multiple unsafe behaviours are edited jointly, and that both monolingual and cross-lingual detoxification remain effective only under specific model-method combinations. Overall, our results indicate that KE-based detoxification is robust only for certain models, limited numbers of detoxification objectives, and a subset of languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\uff08KE-based\uff09\u53bb\u6bd2\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u4f18\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u7ec4\u5408\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u68c0\u9a8c\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u6bd2\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u2018\u4f2a\u53bb\u6bd2\u2019\u73b0\u8c61\u2014\u2014\u5373\u6bd2\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0b\u964d\u6e90\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u884c\u4e3a\u9000\u5316\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u6291\u5236\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u7f16\u8f91\u591a\u79cd\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u884c\u4e3a\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u53bb\u6bd2\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e14\u53bb\u6bd2\u6709\u6548\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u3002\u603b\u4f53\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u524dKE-based\u53bb\u6bd2\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5177\u5907\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709KE-based\u53bb\u6bd2\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u81ea\u52a8\u6bd2\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9690\u542b\u5047\u8bbe\uff1a\u6bd2\u6027\u5206\u6570\u964d\u4f4e\u5373\u4ee3\u8868\u884c\u4e3a\u771f\u6b63\u88ab\u6291\u5236\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u5f0f\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u751f\u6210\u884c\u4e3a\u9000\u5316\u7684\u2018\u4f2a\u53bb\u6bd2\u2019\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u53bb\u6bd2\u6548\u679c\u7684\u8bef\u5224\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u3001\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u771f\u5b9e\u53cd\u6620\u53bb\u6bd2\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff1a(1) \u4f18\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b(2) \u7ec4\u5408\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1a\u8bc4\u4f30\u540c\u65f6\u7f16\u8f91\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u884c\u4e3a\u65f6\u7684\u6548\u679c\u8870\u51cf\uff1b(3) \u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1a\u8003\u5bdf\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc6\u522b\u4f2a\u53bb\u6bd2\u3001\u5206\u6790\u8054\u5408\u7f16\u8f91\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b-\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u91cf\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u6bd2\u6027\u5206\u6570\u4e0b\u964d\u5b9e\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u9000\u5316\u6240\u81f4\uff0c\u5373\u2018\u4f2a\u53bb\u6bd2\u2019\uff1b\u8054\u5408\u7f16\u8f91\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u76ee\u6807\u65f6\u53bb\u6bd2\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u5355\u8bed\u8a00\u53bb\u6bd2\u5747\u4ec5\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "KE-based\u53bb\u6bd2\u65b9\u6cd5\u76ee\u524d\u4ec5\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6709\u9650\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u53bb\u6bd2\u76ee\u6807\u4ee5\u53ca\u90e8\u5206\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5176\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u5e94\u8c28\u614e\u4f9d\u8d56\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u53d1\u5c55\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u53bb\u6bd2\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Building on an existing supervised tabular predictor, the framework constructs a reasoning-centric knowledge base composed of labeled tabular records, where each sample includes structured predictors, a compact natural language text-mode summary, and a model-generated reasoning trajectory. During inference, R2RAG-Flood issues context-augmented prompts that retrieve and condition on relevant reasoning trajectories from nearby geospatial neighbors and canonical class prototypes, enabling the large language model backbone to emulate and adapt prior reasoning rather than learn new task-specific parameters. Predictions follow a two-stage procedure that first determines property damage occurrence and then refines severity within a three-level Property Damage Extent categorization, with a conditional downgrade step to correct over-predicted severity. In a case study of Harris County, Texas at the 12-digit Hydrologic Unit Code scale, the supervised tabular baseline trained directly on structured predictors achieves 0.714 overall accuracy and 0.859 damage class accuracy for medium and high damage classes. Across seven large language model backbones, R2RAG-Flood attains 0.613 to 0.668 overall accuracy and 0.757 to 0.896 damage class accuracy, approaching the supervised baseline while additionally producing a structured rationale for each prediction. Using a severity-per-cost efficiency metric derived from API pricing and GPU instance costs, lightweight R2RAG-Flood variants demonstrate substantially higher efficiency than both the supervised tabular baseline and larger language models, while requiring no task-specific training or fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "R2RAG-Flood \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u98ce\u66b4\u540e\u623f\u4ea7\u635f\u6bc1\u7684\u5373\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4ee5\u63a8\u7406\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u90bb\u8fd1\u5730\u7406\u90bb\u5c45\u548c\u5178\u578b\u7c7b\u522b\u539f\u578b\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5148\u524d\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9884\u6d4b\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u5148\u5224\u65ad\u635f\u6bc1\u662f\u5426\u53d1\u751f\uff0c\u518d\u7ec6\u5316\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u81f3\u4e09\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u964d\u7ea7\u4fee\u6b63\u8fc7\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u3002\u5728\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af\u5dde\u54c8\u91cc\u65af\u53bf12\u4f4d\u6c34\u6587\u5355\u5143\u4ee3\u7801\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e860.613\u81f30.668\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c0.757\u81f30.896\u7684\u635f\u6bc1\u7c7b\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u4f9d\u636e\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u98ce\u66b4\u540e\u623f\u4ea7\u635f\u6bc1\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6458\u8981\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5fc3\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff1b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u90bb\u8fd1\u5730\u7406\u533a\u57df\u548c\u5178\u578b\u7c7b\u522b\u539f\u578b\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9884\u6d4b\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u635f\u6bc1\u53d1\u751f\u5224\u65ad\u4e0e\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6761\u4ef6\u964d\u7ea7\u673a\u5236\u7ea0\u6b63\u8fc7\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u6240\u6709\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5747\u4e0d\u9700\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u54c8\u91cc\u65af\u53bf\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0cR2RAG-Flood \u5728\u4e03\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f970.613\u81f30.668\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c0.757\u81f30.896\u7684\u635f\u6bc1\u7c7b\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\uff080.714\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c0.859\u635f\u6bc1\u7c7b\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff09\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7248\u672c\u5728\u5355\u4f4d\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "R2RAG-Flood \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u98ce\u66b4\u540e\u623f\u4ea7\u635f\u6bc1\u5373\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u6548\u7387\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u6216\u9700\u5feb\u901f\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

However, its spatial behavior lacks rigorous understanding from a physical systems perspective, leading to reliance on heuristics for hyperparameter selection. This work introduces a novel analytical approach that characterizes MHE by examining its Point Spread Function (PSF), which is analogous to the Green's function of the system. This methodology enables a quantification of the encoding's spatial resolution and fidelity. We derive a closed-form approximation for the collision-free PSF, uncovering inherent grid-induced anisotropy and a logarithmic spatial profile. We establish that the idealized spatial bandwidth, specifically the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM), is determined by the average resolution, $N_{\\text{avg}}$. This leads to a counterintuitive finding: the effective resolution of the model is governed by the broadened empirical FWHM (and therefore $N_{\\text{avg}}$), rather than the finest resolution $N_{\\max}$, a broadening effect we demonstrate arises from optimization dynamics. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of finite hash capacity, demonstrating how collisions introduce speckle noise and degrade the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Leveraging these theoretical insights, we propose Rotated MHE (R-MHE), an architecture that applies distinct rotations to the input coordinates at each resolution level. R-MHE mitigates anisotropy while maintaining the efficiency and parameter count of the original MHE.

By generating sequences in any order and allowing for parallel decoding, they enable fast inference and strong performance on non-causal tasks. However, this flexibility comes with a training complexity trade-off: MDMs train on an exponentially large set of masking patterns, which is not only computationally expensive, but also creates a train--test mismatch between the random masks used in training and the highly structured masks induced by inference-time unmasking. In this work, we propose Progressive UnMAsking (PUMA), a simple modification of the forward masking process that aligns training-time and inference-time masking patterns, thereby focusing optimization on inference-aligned masks and speeding up training. Empirically, PUMA speeds up pretraining at the 125M scale by $\\approx 2.5\\times$ and offers complementary advantages on top of common recipes like autoregressive initialization.

Recent work MemAgent has tried to tackle this by processing context chunk-by-chunk in an RNN-like loop and updating a textual memory for final answering. However, this naive recurrent memory update faces two crucial drawbacks: (i) memory can quickly explode because it can update indiscriminately, even on evidence-free chunks; and (ii) the loop lacks an exit mechanism, leading to unnecessary computation after even sufficient evidence is collected. To address these issues, we propose GRU-Mem, which incorporates two text-controlled gates for more stable and efficient long-context reasoning. Specifically, in GRU-Mem, the memory only updates when the update gate is open and the recurrent loop will exit immediately once the exit gate is open. To endow the model with such capabilities, we introduce two reward signals $r^{\\text{update}}$ and $r^{\\text{exit}}$ within end-to-end RL, rewarding the correct updating and exiting behaviors respectively. Experiments on various long-context reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GRU-Mem, which generally outperforms the vanilla MemAgent with up to 400\\% times inference speed acceleration.", "AI": {"tldr": "GRU-Mem \u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u95e8\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7206\u70b8\u548c\u5faa\u73af\u65e0\u9000\u51fa\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u65b0\u95e8\u548c\u9000\u51fa\u95e8\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGRU-Mem \u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e MemAgent\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe 400%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982 MemAgent \u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8bb0\u5fc6\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0d\u53d7\u63a7\uff08\u6613\u5728\u65e0\u5173\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0a\u66f4\u65b0\uff09\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9000\u51fa\u673a\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa GRU-Mem \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u95e8\u2014\u2014\u66f4\u65b0\u95e8\u548c\u9000\u51fa\u95e8\uff0c\u4ec5\u5f53\u66f4\u65b0\u95e8\u5f00\u542f\u65f6\u624d\u66f4\u65b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u4e14\u4e00\u65e6\u9000\u51fa\u95e8\u5f00\u542f\u5373\u523b\u7ec8\u6b62\u5faa\u73af\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u4e2a\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7 $r^{\\text{update}}$ \u548c $r^{\\text{exit}}$ \u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u6b63\u786e\u6267\u884c\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u9000\u51fa\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cGRU-Mem \u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e MemAgent\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347 400%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "GRU-Mem \u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u5373\u65f6\u9000\u51fa\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u81a8\u80c0\u4e0e\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Through cross-architecture and cross-dataset latent alignment across healthy, adult, pediatric, and sub-Saharan African glioma cohorts, we identify a stable backbone of shared representations, while dataset shift is driven by differential reliance on population-specific latents.

Such an imbalance can degrade representation quality and induce biased model behavior, yet a rigorous characterization of these effects is lacking. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze the training dynamics of contrastive learning with Transformer-based encoders under imbalanced data. Our results reveal that neuron weights evolve through three distinct stages of training, with different dynamics for majority features, minority features, and noise. We further show that minority features reduce representational capacity, increase the need for more complex architectures, and hinder the separation of ground-truth features from noise. Inspired by these neuron-level behaviors, we show that pruning restores performance degraded by imbalance and enhances feature separation, offering both conceptual insights and practical guidance. Major theoretical findings are validated through numerical experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6743\u91cd\u6f14\u5316\u7ecf\u5386\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u7279\u5f81\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u963b\u788d\u771f\u5b9e\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u526a\u679d\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u7ecf\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5e38\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4ece\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5c42\u9762\u63ed\u793a\u6743\u91cd\u6f14\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6743\u91cd\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6f14\u5316\u7279\u6027\uff1b\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u7279\u5f81\u5bfc\u81f4\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\u3001\u9700\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u59a8\u788d\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u79bb\uff1b\u526a\u679d\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u79bb\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u7406\u8bba\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u526a\u679d\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u7406\u8bba\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

While delta-tuning has proven effective in boosting the performance and efficiency of LLMs during adaptation, its advantages cannot be directly transferred to the fine-tuning pipeline of vision foundation models. To push the boundaries of adaptation efficiency for vision tasks, we propose an adapter with Complex Linear Projection Optimization (CoLin). For architecture, we design a novel low-rank complex adapter that introduces only about 1% parameters to the backbone. For efficiency, we theoretically prove that low-rank composite matrices suffer from severe convergence issues during training, and address this challenge with a tailored loss. Extensive experiments on object detection, segmentation, image classification, and rotated object detection (remote sensing scenario) demonstrate that CoLin outperforms both full fine-tuning and classical delta-tuning approaches with merely 1% parameters for the first time, providing a novel and efficient solution for deployment of vision foundation models.

To improve stability, recent methods typically use a fixed sequence-level IS ratio for all tokens in a sequence or adjust each token's IS ratio separately, thereby neglecting temporal off-policy derivation across tokens in a sequence. In this paper, we first empirically identify that local off-policy deviation is structurally inconsistent at the token level, which may distort policy-gradient updates across adjacent tokens and lead to training collapse. To address the issue, we propose Online Causal Kalman Filtering for stable and effective Policy Optimization (KPO). Concretely, we model the desired IS ratio as a latent state that evolves across tokens and apply a Kalman filter to update this state online and autoregressively based on the states of past tokens, regardless of future tokens. The resulting filtered IS ratios preserve token-wise local structure-aware variation while strongly smoothing noise spikes, yielding more stable and effective policy updates. Experimentally, KPO achieves superior results on challenging math reasoning datasets compared with state-of-the-art counterparts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\uff08IS\uff09\u6bd4\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u56e0\u679c\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08KPO\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7406\u60f3\u7684IS\u6bd4\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u968f\u4ee4\u724c\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u4ee4\u724c\u72b6\u6001\u5728\u7ebf\u3001\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5730\u66f4\u65b0\u8be5\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u6ed1\u566a\u58f0\u5cf0\u503c\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cKPO\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\uff0c\u56e0\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u6bd4\u7387\u7684\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u6bd4\u7387\u6216\u72ec\u7acb\u8c03\u6574\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4ee4\u724c\u6bd4\u7387\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4ee4\u724c\u95f4\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u975e\u7b56\u7565\u63a8\u5bfc\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u5c40\u90e8\u975e\u7b56\u7565\u504f\u5dee\u5728\u4ee4\u724c\u5c42\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u626d\u66f2\u76f8\u90bb\u4ee4\u724c\u95f4\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u7ebf\u56e0\u679c\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff08KPO\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u6bd4\u7387\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u6839\u636e\u524d\u5e8f\u4ee4\u724c\u72b6\u6001\u5728\u7ebf\u3001\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5730\u66f4\u65b0\u8be5\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f9d\u8d56\u672a\u6765\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u5f3a\u5e73\u6ed1\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cKPO\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "KPO\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u56e0\u679c\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7531\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

However, achieving this remains challenging due to insufficient training data with limited subject identities, narrow audio representations, and restricted explicit controllability. In this paper, we propose 3DXTalker, an expressive 3D talking avatar through data-curated identity modeling, audio-rich representations, and spatial dynamics controllability. 3DXTalker enables scalable identity modeling via 2D-to-3D data curation pipeline and disentangled representations, alleviating data scarcity and improving identity generalization. Then, we introduce frame-wise amplitude and emotional cues beyond standard speech embeddings, ensuring superior lip synchronization and nuanced expression modulation.

In these resource-constrained on-device settings, selecting an appropriate large language model (LLM) backbone is a critical challenge: models must balance accuracy with strict inference latency and hardware efficiency constraints. This makes hardware-software co-design a game-changing requirement for on-device LLM deployment, where each hardware platform demands a tailored architectural solution. We propose a hardware co-design law that jointly captures model accuracy and inference performance. Specifically, we model training loss as an explicit function of architectural hyperparameters and characterise inference latency via roofline modelling. We empirically evaluate 1,942 candidate architectures on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, training 170 selected models for 10B tokens each to fit a scaling law relating architecture to training loss. By coupling this scaling law with latency modelling, we establish a direct accuracy-latency correspondence and identify the Pareto frontier for hardware co-designed LLMs. We further formulate architecture search as a joint optimisation over precision and performance, deriving feasible design regions under industrial hardware and application budgets. Our approach reduces architecture selection from months to days. At the same latency as Qwen2.5-0.5B on the target hardware, our co-designed architecture achieves 19.42% lower perplexity on WikiText-2. To our knowledge, this is the first principled and operational framework for hardware co-design scaling laws in on-device LLM deployment. We will make the code and related checkpoints publicly available.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u786c\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLAs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u67b6\u6784\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5c4b\u9876\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u523b\u753b\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u7ed3\u54081942\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e170\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u77ed\u4e86\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u5728\u4e0eQwen2.5-0.5B\u76f8\u540c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0b\uff0c\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\u5728WikiText-2\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b019.42%\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\uff0c\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u8bbe\u5907\u7aefLLM\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u786c\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u81ea\u4e3b\u8f66\u8f86\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u7a7a\u95f4\u7b49\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u9762\u4e34\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u517c\u987e\u8f6f\u786c\u4ef6\u7279\u6027\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u786c\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u67b6\u6784\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5c4b\u9876\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u62df\u5408\u7f29\u653e\u5f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6a21\u578b\u5efa\u7acb\u51c6\u786e\u7387-\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u8fdb\u884c\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0eQwen2.5-0.5B\u76f8\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u67b6\u6784\u5728WikiText-2\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523019.42%\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\uff1b\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece\u6570\u6708\u7f29\u77ed\u81f3\u6570\u5929\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u8bbe\u5907\u7aefLLM\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u786c\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f29\u653e\u5f8b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u786c\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u4ef7\u503c\u4e0e\u63a8\u5e7f\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Reasoning over such knowledge requires models to integrate spatial relationships, visual cues, real-world context, and domain-specific expertise-capabilities that current large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle to exhibit consistently. Yet, datasets used to benchmark VLMs on map-based reasoning remain narrow in scope, restricted to specific domains, and heavily reliant on artificially generated content (outputs from LLMs or pipeline-based methods), offering limited depth for evaluating genuine geospatial reasoning. To address this gap, we present MapVerse, a large-scale benchmark built on real-world maps. It comprises 11,837 human-authored question-answer pairs across 1,025 maps, spanning ten diverse map categories and multiple question categories for each. The dataset provides a rich setting for evaluating map reading, interpretation, and multimodal reasoning. We evaluate ten state-of-the-art models against our benchmark to establish baselines and quantify reasoning gaps. Beyond overall performance, we conduct fine-grained categorical analyses to assess model inference across multiple dimensions and investigate the visual factors shaping reasoning outcomes. Our findings reveal that while current VLMs perform competitively on classification-style tasks, both open- and closed-source models fall short on advanced tasks requiring complex spatial reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "MapVerse \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u56fe\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b11,837\u4e2a\u7531\u4eba\u7c7b\u7f16\u5199\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u8986\u76d61,025\u5f20\u5730\u56fe\u548c\u5341\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5730\u56fe\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u5730\u56fe\u9605\u8bfb\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5341\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5c1a\u53ef\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5730\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8303\u56f4\u72ed\u7a84\uff0c\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5730\u56fe\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaMapVerse\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5730\u56fe\u4e0a\u768411,837\u4e2a\u4eba\u7c7b\u7f16\u5199\u7684\u95ee\u9898-\u7b54\u6848\u5bf9\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u5341\u7c7b\u5730\u56fe\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u578b\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5341\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u590d\u6742\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u56fe\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "MapVerse\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5730\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002"}}

This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of machine learning and deep learning methodologies for identifying malnutrition among children under five years of age in Nepal. We systematically compared 16 algorithms spanning deep learning, gradient boosting, and traditional machine learning families, using data from the Nepal Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2019. A composite malnutrition indicator was constructed by integrating stunting, wasting, and underweight status, and model performance was evaluated using ten metrics, with emphasis on F1-score and recall to account for substantial class imbalance and the high cost of failing to detect malnourished children. Among all models, TabNet demonstrated the best performance, likely attributable to its attention-based architecture, and outperformed both support vector machine and AdaBoost classifiers. A consensus feature importance analysis identified maternal education, household wealth index, and child age as the primary predictors of malnutrition, followed by geographic characteristics, vaccination status, and meal frequency. Collectively, these results demonstrate a scalable, survey-based screening framework for identifying children at elevated risk of malnutrition and for guiding targeted nutritional interventions. The proposed approach supports Nepal's progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals and offers a transferable methodological template for similar low-resource settings globally.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u8bc6\u522b\u4e94\u5c81\u4ee5\u4e0b\u513f\u7ae5\u8425\u517b\u4e0d\u826f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u67902019\u5e74\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u591a\u6307\u6807\u805a\u7c7b\u8c03\u67e5\uff08MICS\uff09\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e8616\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6574\u5408\u53d1\u80b2\u8fdf\u7f13\u3001\u6d88\u7626\u548c\u4f53\u91cd\u8fc7\u8f7b\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8425\u517b\u4e0d\u826f\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684TabNet\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u548cAdaBoost\u7b49\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6bcd\u4eb2\u6559\u80b2\u6c34\u5e73\u3001\u5bb6\u5ead\u8d22\u5bcc\u6307\u6570\u548c\u513f\u7ae5\u5e74\u9f84\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u662f\u5730\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u72b6\u51b5\u548c\u996e\u98df\u9891\u7387\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8c03\u67e5\u7684\u7b5b\u67e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7cbe\u51c6\u5e72\u9884\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4e3a\u5176\u4ed6\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u5730\u533a\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6a21\u677f\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ae5\u5e74\u8425\u517b\u4e0d\u826f\u5728\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u5730\u533a\u4ecd\u662f\u91cd\u5927\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u75c5\u4f8b\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8017\u65f6\u8d39\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u504f\u8fdc\u5730\u533a\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u65bd\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u513f\u7ae5\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u53ca\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u75282019\u5e74\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u591a\u6307\u6807\u805a\u7c7b\u8c03\u67e5\uff08MICS\uff09\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u53d1\u80b2\u8fdf\u7f13\u3001\u6d88\u7626\u548c\u4f53\u91cd\u8fc7\u8f7b\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8425\u517b\u4e0d\u826f\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e8616\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5341\u9879\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8F1\u5206\u6570\u548c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u53ca\u6f0f\u68c0\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u8bc6\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u3002", "result": "TabNet\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u5176\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u4f18\u4e8e\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u548cAdaBoost\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u4e3a\u6bcd\u4eb2\u6559\u80b2\u6c34\u5e73\u3001\u5bb6\u5ead\u8d22\u5bcc\u6307\u6570\u548c\u513f\u7ae5\u5e74\u9f84\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u4e3a\u5730\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u9910\u6b21\u9891\u7387\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u513f\u7ae5\u7684\u7b5b\u67e5\u4e0e\u5e72\u9884\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8425\u517b\u4e0d\u826f\u98ce\u9669\u7b5b\u67e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u76ee\u6807\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5168\u7403\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In response, several datasets have been established to train detection models aimed at distinguishing AI-generated images from real ones. However, existing datasets suffer from limited generalization, low image quality, overly simple prompts, and insufficient image diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a high-quality, large-scale dataset comprising over 730,000 images across multiple categories, including both real and AI-generated images. The generated images are synthesized via state-of-the-art methods, including text-to-image generation (guided by over 10,000 carefully designed prompts), image inpainting, image refinement, and face swapping. Each generated image is annotated with its generation method and category. Inpainting images further include binary masks to indicate inpainted regions, providing rich metadata for analysis. Compared to existing datasets, detection models trained on our dataset demonstrate superior generalization capabilities. Our dataset not only serves as a strong benchmark for evaluating detection methods but also contributes to advancing the robustness of AI-generated image detection techniques. Building upon this, we propose a lightweight detection method based on image noise entropy, which transforms the original image into an entropy tensor of Non-Local Means (NLM) noise before classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained on our dataset achieve strong generalization, and our method delivers competitive performance, establishing a solid baseline for future research.

In this work, we investigate whether benchmark performance is primarily driven by the degree of statistical pattern overlap between pre-training corpora and evaluation datasets. We measure this overlap using word-level unigram cross-entropy and word frequency statistics, and perform controlled experiments across $10$ zero-shot benchmarks, $4$ pre-training datasets spanning $8.5\\mathrm{B}$ to $60\\mathrm{B}$ tokens, and model sizes ranging from $400\\mathrm{M}$ to $3\\mathrm{B}$ parameters. Our results demonstrate a robust inverse relationship between word-level unigram cross-entropy and benchmark performance, suggesting that widely used benchmarks are strongly influenced by word overlap between training and evaluation data. Thus, larger pre-training subsets with similar word-level unigram cross-entropy yield improved downstream results, indicating that word frequency statistics play an additional role in shaping benchmark scores. Taken together, these results suggest that many standard benchmarks are only weakly out-of-distribution relative to pre-training corpora, so that simple word-overlap statistics predict benchmark performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bcd\u7ea7\u72ec\u5143\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u548c\u8bcd\u9891\u7edf\u8ba1\u8861\u91cf\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\uff0c\u572810\u4e2a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u57fa\u51c6\u30014\u4e2a\u6db5\u76d685\u4ebf\u81f3600\u4ebf\u8bcd\u5143\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca4\u4ebf\u81f330\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8bcd\u7ea7\u72ec\u5143\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u5448\u663e\u8457\u53cd\u6bd4\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u4e3b\u6d41\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u53d7\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u95f4\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cd\u53e0\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b50\u96c6\u82e5\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u8bcd\u7ea7\u72ec\u5143\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\uff0c\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8bcd\u9891\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e5f\u5bf9\u57fa\u51c6\u5f97\u5206\u6709\u989d\u5916\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u603b\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4ec5\u51ed\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cd\u53e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5373\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6784\u6210\u662f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cd\u53e0\u800c\u4e0d\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u53cd\u6620\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u5931\u771f\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7a76\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cd\u53e0\u662f\u5426\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8bcd\u7ea7\u72ec\u5143\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u548c\u8bcd\u9891\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u5316\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u95f4\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cd\u53e0\uff1b\u572810\u4e2a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u57fa\u51c6\u30014\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\uff088.5B\u201360B tokens\uff09\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u53ca400M\u20133B\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8bcd\u7ea7\u72ec\u5143\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u5448\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u53cd\u6bd4\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cd\u53e0\u662f\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b50\u96c6\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u4f3c\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u8bcd\u9891\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e5f\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6570\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cd\u53e0\u7a0b\u5ea6\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u3001\u771f\u6b63\u8de8\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

For example, while transformers capture rich associations, they are mostly agnostic to event timing and ordering, thereby bypassing potential causal reasoning.\n  Intuitively, we need a method capable of evaluating the \"degree of alignment\" among patient-specific trajectories and identifying their shared patterns, i.e., the significant events in a consistent sequence. This necessitates treating timing as a true \\emph{computable} dimension, allowing models to assign ``relative timestamps'' to candidate events beyond their observed physical times.\n  In this work, we introduce LITT, a novel Timing-Transformer architecture that enables temporary alignment of sequential events on a virtual ``relative timeline'', thereby enabling \\emph{event-timing-focused attention} and personalized interpretations of clinical trajectories. Its interpretability and effectiveness are validated on real-world longitudinal EHR data from 3,276 breast cancer patients to predict the onset timing of cardiotoxicity-induced heart disease. Furthermore, LITT outperforms both the benchmark and state-of-the-art survival analysis methods on public datasets, positioning it as a significant step forward for precision medicine in clinical AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "LITT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684Timing-Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u865a\u62df\u7684'\u76f8\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf'\u4e0a\u5bf9\u5e8f\u5217\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u805a\u7126\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u89e3\u8bfb\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57283,276\u540d\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u7eb5\u5411\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5fc3\u6bd2\u6027\u5fc3\u810f\u75c5\u53d1\u75c5\u65f6\u95f4\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8aAI\u4e2d\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u533b\u7597\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u6316\u6398\u60a3\u8005\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u89c6\u4e3a\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u652f\u6301\u76f8\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u60a3\u8005\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6392\u5217\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLITT\uff08Timing-Transformer\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u865a\u62df\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u5019\u9009\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5206\u914d\u76f8\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u89c2\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u6ce8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5173\u8054\u6027\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7eb5\u5411\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u6570\u636e\uff083,276\u540d\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u60a3\u8005\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cLITT\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u5fc3\u6bd2\u6027\u8bf1\u53d1\u5fc3\u810f\u75c5\u53d1\u4f5c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LITT\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8b\u4ef6\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u662f\u63a8\u52a8\u7cbe\u51c6\u533b\u7597\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u9886\u57df\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

Text provides explicit semantic information that can enhance anomaly characterization and reduce false alarms. However, extracting effective text features is challenging due to the inability of general-purpose language models to capture anomaly-specific nuances and the scarcity of relevant descriptions. Furthermore, multimodal fusion often suffers from redundancy and imbalance. To address these issues, we propose a novel text-guided framework. First, we introduce an in-context learning-based multi-stage text augmentation mechanism to generate high-quality anomaly text samples for fine-tuning the text feature extractor. Second, we design a multi-scale bottleneck Transformer fusion module that uses compressed bottleneck tokens to progressively integrate information across modalities, mitigating redundancy and imbalance.

We focus on subject and object marking determined through various permutations of nominative, ergative, and dative noun forms. A treebank-based approach for the generation of minimal pairs using the Grew query language is implemented. We create a dataset of 370 syntactic tests made up of seven tasks containing 50-70 samples each, where three noun forms are tested in any given sample. Five encoder- and two decoder-only models are evaluated with word- and/or sentence-level accuracy metrics. Regardless of the specific syntactic makeup, models performed worst in assigning the ergative case correctly and strongest in assigning the nominative case correctly.

While LLMs excel at processing unstructured text, graph tasks require reasoning over explicit structure, permutation invariance, and computationally complex relationships, creating a mismatch with the representations of text-based models. Our work investigates how LLMs can be effectively applied to graph problems despite these barriers. We introduce a human-interpretable structural encoding strategy for graph-to-text translation that injects graph structure directly into natural language prompts. Our method involves computing a variant of Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) similarity classes and maps them to human-like color tokens rather than numeric labels. The key insight is that semantically meaningful and human-interpretable cues may be more effectively processed by LLMs than opaque symbolic encoding. Experimental results on multiple algorithmic and predictive graph tasks show the considerable improvements by our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets. By capturing both local and global-range dependencies, our method enhances LLM performance especially on graph tasks that require reasoning over global graph structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u7c7b\u989c\u8272\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u6ce8\u5165\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u7684Weisfeiler-Lehman\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u989c\u8272\u6807\u8bb0\u66ff\u4ee3\u6570\u503c\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u4f7fLLM\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u56fe\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u7f6e\u6362\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u96be\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdbWeisfeiler-Lehman\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u56fe\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7c7b\u522b\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u989c\u8272\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5d4c\u5165\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u5bf9\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u56fe\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5408\u6210\u53ca\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u8865\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u77ed\u677f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u878d\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

However, the inherited Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) introduces limitations for multimodal processing. Specifically, applying 1D temporal positional indices disrupts the continuity of visual features along the column dimension, resulting in spatial locality loss. Moreover, RoPE follows the prior that temporally closer image tokens are more causally related, leading to long-term decay in attention allocation and causing the model to progressively neglect earlier visual tokens as the sequence length increases. To address these issues, we propose C^2RoPE, an improved RoPE that explicitly models local spatial Continuity and spatial Causal relationships for visual processing. C^2RoPE introduces a spatio-temporal continuous positional embedding mechanism for visual tokens. It first integrates 1D temporal positions with Cartesian-based spatial coordinates to construct a triplet hybrid positional index, and then employs a frequency allocation strategy to encode spatio-temporal positional information across the three index components.

In realistic interactions, appropriate responses often depend on implicit constraints such as user state, goals, or values that are not explicitly queried later. To evaluate this setting, we introduce \\textbf{LoCoMo-Plus}, a benchmark for assessing cognitive memory under cue--trigger semantic disconnect, where models must retain and apply latent constraints across long conversational contexts. We further show that conventional string-matching metrics and explicit task-type prompting are misaligned with such scenarios, and propose a unified evaluation framework based on constraint consistency. Experiments across diverse backbone models, retrieval-based methods, and memory systems demonstrate that cognitive memory remains challenging and reveals failures not captured by existing benchmarks.

While pre-trained large models have been hypothesized to contain similar knowledge due to extensive pre-training on vast amounts of internet scale data, using them directly in a search procedure is inefficient and inaccurate. Conversely, partial models focus on making high quality predictions for a subset of state and actions: those linked through affordances that achieve user intents~\\citep{khetarpal2020can}. Can we posit large models as partial world models? We provide a formal answer to this question, proving that agents achieving task-agnostic, language-conditioned intents necessarily possess predictive partial-world models informed by affordances. In the multi-task setting, we introduce distribution-robust affordances and show that partial models can be extracted to significantly improve search efficiency. Empirical evaluations in tabletop robotics tasks demonstrate that our affordance-aware partial models reduce the search branching factor and achieve higher rewards compared to full world models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u90e8\u5206\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5fc5\u7136\u5177\u5907\u7531\u529f\u80fd\u5173\u7cfb\uff08affordances\uff09\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u90e8\u5206\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5728\u684c\u9762\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u529f\u80fd\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u641c\u7d22\u5206\u652f\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u6bd4\u5b8c\u6574\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u8574\u542b\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u641c\u7d22\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff1b\u800c\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u529f\u80fd\u5173\u7cfb\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u90e8\u5206\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5fc5\u987b\u62e5\u6709\u7531\u529f\u80fd\u5173\u7cfb\u652f\u6301\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u90e8\u5206\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5173\u7cfb\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6307\u5bfc\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u684c\u9762\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u641c\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5206\u652f\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6700\u7ec8\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u5b8c\u6574\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5730\u89c6\u4e3a\u90e8\u5206\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u9690\u542b\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5173\u7cfb\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at basic Visual Question Answering (VQA), they consistently struggle to grasp the nuanced cultural, emotional, and contextual implications embedded in visual content. This difficulty stems from the task's demand for sophisticated multi-hop reasoning, cultural context, and Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities, which current models lack. To fill this gap, we propose MetaphorStar, the first end-to-end visual reinforcement learning (RL) framework for image implication tasks. Our framework includes three core components: the fine-grained dataset TFQ-Data, the visual RL method TFQ-GRPO, and the well-structured benchmark TFQ-Bench.\n  Our fully open-source MetaphorStar family, trained using TFQ-GRPO on TFQ-Data, significantly improves performance by an average of 82.6% on the image implication benchmarks. Compared with 20+ mainstream MLLMs, MetaphorStar-32B achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) on Multiple-Choice Question and Open-Style Question, significantly outperforms the top closed-source model Gemini-3.0-pro on True-False Question. Crucially, our experiments reveal that learning image implication tasks improves the general understanding ability, especially the complex visual reasoning ability. We further provide a systematic analysis of model parameter scaling, training data scaling, and the impact of different model architectures and training strategies, demonstrating the broad applicability of our method.

We propose Macaron, a template-first benchmark that factorizes reasoning type and cultural aspect across question languages. Using 100 language-agnostic templates that cover 7 reasoning types, 22 cultural aspects, native annotators create scenario-aligned English and local-language multiple-choice questions and systematically derived True/False questions. Macaron contains 11,862 instances spanning 20 countries/cultural contexts, 10 scripts, and 20 languages (including low-resource ones like Amharic, Yoruba, Zulu, Kyrgyz, and some Arabic dialects). In zero-shot evaluation of 21 multilingual LLMs, reasoning-mode models achieve the strongest performance and near-parity between English and local languages, while open-weight models degrade substantially in local languages and often approach chance on T/F tasks. Culture-grounded mathematical and counting templates are consistently the hardest.

Existing UIE methods treat images with a single global model and ignore the inconsistent degradation of different scene components. This oversight leads to significant color distortions and loss of fine details in heterogeneous underwater scenes, especially where degradation varies significantly across different image regions. Therefore, we propose SUCode (Semantic-aware Underwater Codebook Network), which achieves adaptive UIE from semantic-aware discrete codebook representation. Compared with one-shot codebook-based methods, SUCode exploits semantic-aware, pixel-level codebook representation tailored to heterogeneous underwater degradation. A three-stage training paradigm is employed to represent raw underwater image features to avoid pseudo ground-truth contamination. Gated Channel Attention Module (GCAM) and Frequency-Aware Feature Fusion (FAFF) jointly integrate channel and frequency cues for faithful color restoration and texture recovery. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SUCode achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent UIE methods on both reference and no-reference metrics.

Ngai"], "title": "Reinforced Curriculum Pre-Alignment for Domain-Adaptive VLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable general-purpose capabilities but often fall short in specialized domains such as medical imaging or geometric problem-solving. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) can enhance performance within a target domain, but it typically causes catastrophic forgetting, limiting its generalization. The central challenge, therefore, is to adapt VLMs to new domains while preserving their general-purpose capabilities. Continual pretraining is effective for expanding knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs), but it is less feasible for VLMs due to prohibitive computational costs and the unavailability of pretraining data for most open-source models. This necessitates efficient post-training adaptation methods. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in preserving general abilities, yet they often fail in domain adaptation scenarios where the model initially lacks sufficient domain knowledge, leading to optimization collapse. To bridge this gap, we propose Reinforced Curriculum Pre-Alignment (RCPA), a novel post-training paradigm that introduces a curriculum-aware progressive modulation mechanism. In the early phase, RCPA applies partial output constraints to safely expose the model to new domain concepts. As the model's domain familiarity increases, training gradually transitions to full generation optimization, refining responses and aligning them with domain-specific preferences. This staged adaptation balances domain knowledge acquisition with the preservation of general multimodal capabilities.

The core cause of hallucination lies in LLMs' lack of awareness regarding their stored internal knowledge, preventing them from expressing their knowledge state on questions beyond their internal knowledge boundaries, as humans do. However, existing research on knowledge boundary expression primarily focuses on white-box LLMs, leaving methods suitable for black-box LLMs which offer only API access without revealing internal parameters-largely unexplored. Against this backdrop, this paper proposes LSCL (LLM-Supervised Confidence Learning), a deep learning-based method for expressing the knowledge boundaries of black-box LLMs. Based on the knowledge distillation framework, this method designs a deep learning model. Taking the input question, output answer, and token probability from a black-box LLM as inputs, it constructs a mapping between the inputs and the model' internal knowledge state, enabling the quantification and expression of the black-box LLM' knowledge boundaries. Experiments conducted on diverse public datasets and with multiple prominent black-box LLMs demonstrate that LSCL effectively assists black-box LLMs in accurately expressing their knowledge boundaries. It significantly outperforms existing baseline models on metrics such as accuracy and recall rate. Furthermore, considering scenarios where some black-box LLMs do not support access to token probability, an adaptive alternative method is proposed. The performance of this alternative approach is close to that of LSCL and surpasses baseline models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLSCL\uff08LLM\u76d1\u7763\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u9ed1\u76d2\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fb9\u754c\u8868\u8fbe\u4e0a\u7684\u96be\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8f93\u5165\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u8f93\u51fa\u7b54\u6848\u548c\u6807\u8bb0\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8f93\u5165\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u72b6\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u91cf\u5316\u5e76\u8868\u8fbe\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fb9\u754c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLSCL\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e3b\u6d41\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u652f\u6301\u8bbf\u95ee\u6807\u8bb0\u6982\u7387\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1LSCL\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u767d\u76d2\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fb9\u754c\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9bAPI\u8bbf\u95ee\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u53d6\u5185\u90e8\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5e2e\u52a9\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u8868\u8fbe\u5176\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578bLSCL\uff0c\u4ee5\u9ed1\u76d2\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u8f93\u51fa\u7b54\u6848\u53ca\u6807\u8bb0\u6982\u7387\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8f93\u5165\u4e0e\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u72b6\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u4e0e\u8868\u8fbe\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u53d6\u6807\u8bb0\u6982\u7387\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLSCL\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41\u9ed1\u76d2\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1LSCL\uff0c\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "LSCL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ed1\u76d2\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fb9\u754c\u8868\u8fbe\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u987b\u8bbf\u95ee\u5185\u90e8\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u4ea4\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

In the transportation sector, object detection is widely used to improve security, for example, in traffic security and passenger crossings at train stations. Some accidents occur in the train crossing area at the station, like passengers uncarefully when passing through the yellow line. So further security needs to be developed. Additional technology is required to reduce the number of accidents. This paper focuses on passenger detection applications at train stations using YOLOX and Edge AI Accelerator hardware. the performance of the AI accelerator will be compared with Jetson Orin Nano.

We revisit this assumption for pre-norm Transformers and ask to what extent sample-dependent normalization is needed inside Transformer blocks. We introduce TaperNorm, a drop-in replacement for RMSNorm/LayerNorm that behaves exactly like the standard normalizer early in training and then smoothly tapers to a learned sample-independent linear/affine map. A single global gate is held at $g{=}1$ during gate warmup, used to calibrate the scaling branch via EMAs, and then cosine-decayed to $g{=}0$, at which point per-token statistics vanish and the resulting fixed scalings can be folded into adjacent linear projections. Our theoretical and empirical results isolate scale anchoring as the key role played by output normalization: as a (near) $0$-homogeneous map it removes radial gradients at the output, whereas without such an anchor cross-entropy encourages unbounded logit growth (``logit chasing''). We further show that a simple fixed-target auxiliary loss on the pre-logit residual-stream scale provides an explicit alternative anchor and can aid removal of the final normalization layer. Empirically, TaperNorm matches normalized baselines under identical setups while eliminating per-token statistics and enabling these layers to be folded into adjacent linear projections at inference. On an efficiency microbenchmark, folding internal scalings yields up to $1.22\\times$ higher throughput in last-token logits mode.

This limitation is especially pronounced in the medical imaging domain, where effective performance requires both robust visual perception and structured reasoning. In this work, we address this gap by proposing VRFT-Aug, a visual reinforcement fine-tuning framework tailored for the medical domain. VRFT-Aug introduces a series of training strategies designed to augment both perception and reasoning, including prior knowledge injection, perception-driven policy refinement, medically informed reward shaping, and behavioral imitation. Together, these methods aim to stabilize and improve the RFT process.\n  Through extensive experiments across multiple medical datasets, we show that our approaches consistently outperform both standard supervised fine-tuning and RFT baselines. Moreover, we provide empirically grounded insights and practical training heuristics that can be generalized to other medical image tasks.

However, as context lengths increase, a fundamental limitation of the softmax function emerges: it tends to diffuse probability mass to irrelevant tokens degrading performance in long-sequence scenarios. Furthermore, attempts to sharpen focus by lowering softmax temperature hinder learnability due to vanishing gradients. We introduce LUCID Attention, an architectural modification that applies a preconditioner to the attention probabilities. This preconditioner, derived from exponentiated key-key similarities, minimizes overlap between the keys in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, thus allowing the query to focus on important keys among large number of keys accurately with same computational complexity as standard attention. Additionally, LUCID's preconditioning-based approach to retrieval bypasses the need for low temperature and the learnability problems associated with it. We validate our approach by training ~1 billion parameter language models evaluated on up to 128K tokens. Our results demonstrate significant gains on long-context retrieval tasks, specifically retrieval tasks from BABILong, RULER, SCROLLS and LongBench. For instance, LUCID achieves up to 18% improvement in BABILong and 14% improvement in RULER multi-needle performance compared to standard attention.", "AI": {"tldr": "LUCID Attention \u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5668\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6307\u6570\u5316\u952e-\u952e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u952e\u5728\u518d\u751f\u6838\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4f4e\u6e29\u5ea6 softmax \u5e26\u6765\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982 BABILong\u3001RULER\u3001SCROLLS\u3001LongBench\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5728 BABILong \u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe 18%\uff0c\u5728 RULER \u591a\u9488\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347 14%\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6 softmax \u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u4f1a\u5c06\u6982\u7387\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u6563\u5230\u65e0\u5173\u8bcd\u5143\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u964d\u4f4e softmax \u6e29\u5ea6\u867d\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u805a\u7126\u4f46\u5f15\u53d1\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u7cbe\u51c6\u805a\u7126\u53c8\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa LUCID Attention\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u952e-\u952e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u952e\u5728\u518d\u751f\u6838\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ea6 10 \u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u957f\u8fbe 128K token \u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cLUCID \u5728 BABILong\u3001RULER\u3001SCROLLS\u3001LongBench \u7b49\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe 18%\uff08BABILong\uff09\u548c 14%\uff08RULER \u591a\u9488\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "LUCID Attention \u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53d1\u6563\u4e0e\u4f4e\u6e29\u5ea6\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u56f0\u96be\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u6587\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Here, we introduce DermFM-Zero, a dermatology vision-language foundation model trained via masked latent modelling and contrastive learning on over 4 million multimodal data points. We evaluated DermFM-Zero across 20 benchmarks spanning zero-shot diagnosis and multimodal retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art performance without task-specific adaptation. We further evaluated its zero-shot capabilities in three multinational reader studies involving over 1,100 clinicians. In primary care settings, AI assistance enabled general practitioners to nearly double their differential diagnostic accuracy across 98 skin conditions. In specialist settings, the model significantly outperformed board-certified dermatologists in multimodal skin cancer assessment. In collaborative workflows, AI assistance enabled non-experts to surpass unassisted experts while improving management appropriateness. Finally, we show that DermFM-Zero's latent representations are interpretable: sparse autoencoders unsupervisedly disentangle clinically meaningful concepts that outperform predefined-vocabulary approaches and enable targeted suppression of artifact-induced biases, enhancing robustness without retraining.

However, existing methods often suffer from noisy and conflicting update signals. In this research, we propose C-MOP (Cluster-based Momentum Optimized Prompting), a framework that stabilizes optimization via Boundary-Aware Contrastive Sampling (BACS) and Momentum-Guided Semantic Clustering (MGSC). Specifically, BACS utilizes batch-level information to mine tripartite features--Hard Negatives, Anchors, and Boundary Pairs--to precisely characterize the typical representation and decision boundaries of positive and negative prompt samples. To resolve semantic conflicts, MGSC introduces a textual momentum mechanism with temporal decay that distills persistent consensus from fluctuating gradients across iterations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that C-MOP consistently outperforms SOTA baselines like PromptWizard and ProTeGi, yielding average gains of 1.58% and 3.35%. Notably, C-MOP enables a general LLM with 3B activated parameters to surpass a 70B domain-specific dense LLM, highlighting its effectiveness in driving precise prompt evolution.

To accelerate inference, recent works like GenDR adopt step distillation to minimize the step number to one. However, the memory boundary still restricts the maximum processing size, necessitating tile-by-tile restoration of high-resolution images. Through profiling the pipeline, we pinpoint that the variational auto-encoder (VAE) is the bottleneck of latency and memory. To completely solve the problem, we leverage pixel-(un)shuffle operations to eliminate the VAE, reversing the latent-based GenDR to pixel-space GenDR-Pix. However, upscale with x8 pixelshuffle may induce artifacts of repeated patterns. To alleviate the distortion, we propose a multi-stage adversarial distillation to progressively remove the encoder and decoder. Specifically, we utilize generative features from the previous stage models to guide adversarial discrimination. Moreover, we propose random padding to augment generative features and avoid discriminator collapse. We also introduce a masked Fourier space loss to penalize the outliers of amplitude. To improve inference performance, we empirically integrate a padding-based self-ensemble with classifier-free guidance to improve inference scaling. Experimental results show that GenDR-Pix performs 2.8x acceleration and 60% memory-saving compared to GenDR with negligible visual degradation, surpassing other one-step diffusion SR.

Despite rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), it remains unclear whether they can meet the structural requirements of this process, which hinge on preserving roles, methods, and effect-size attribution across documents rather than on recognizing isolated entities. We propose a structural, diagnostic framework that evaluates LLM-based evidence extraction as a progression of schema-constrained queries with increasing relational and numerical complexity, enabling precise identification of failure points beyond atom-level extraction. Using a manually curated corpus spanning five scientific domains, together with a unified query suite and evaluation protocol, we evaluate two state-of-the-art LLMs under both per-document and long-context, multi-document input regimes. Across domains and models, performance remains moderate for single-property queries but degrades sharply once tasks require stable binding between variables, roles, statistical methods, and effect sizes. Full meta-analytic association tuples are extracted with near-zero reliability, and long-context inputs further exacerbate these failures. Downstream aggregation amplifies even minor upstream errors, rendering corpus-level statistics unreliable. Our analysis shows that these limitations stem not from entity recognition errors, but from systematic structural breakdowns, including role reversals, cross-analysis binding drift, instance compression in dense result sections, and numeric misattribution, indicating that current LLMs lack the structural fidelity, relational binding, and numerical grounding required for automated meta-analysis.

However, despite their progress at advanced levels of mathematics, they remain stubbornly bad at basic arithmetic, consistently failing on the simple task of adding two numbers. We present a systematic investigation of this phenomenon. We demonstrate empirically that all frontier models suffer significantly degraded accuracy for integer addition as the number of digits increases. Furthermore, we show that most errors made by these models are highly interpretable and can be attributed to either operand misalignment or a failure to correctly carry; these two error classes explain 87.9%, 62.9%, and 92.4% of Claude Opus 4.1, GPT-5, and Gemini 2.5 Pro errors, respectively. Finally, we show that misalignment errors are frequently related to tokenization, and that carrying errors appear largely as independent random failures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u73b0\u4ee3AI\u5728\u9ad8\u7ea7\u6570\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5353\u8d8a\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u7b97\u672f\uff08\u5982\u52a0\u6cd5\uff09\u4e0a\u4ecd\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3b\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u4f4d\u6570\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u9519\u8bef\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u5bf9\u9f50\u9519\u8bef\u6216\u8fdb\u4f4d\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86Claude Opus 4.1\u3001GPT-5\u548cGemini 2.5 Pro\u7ea687.9%\u300162.9%\u548c92.4%\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff1b\u5176\u4e2d\u5bf9\u9f50\u9519\u8bef\u591a\u4e0e\u5206\u8bcd\u673a\u5236\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u8fdb\u4f4d\u9519\u8bef\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u968f\u673a\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793a\u524d\u6cbfAI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u7b97\u672f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u9519\u8bef\u6839\u6e90\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u591a\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4f4d\u6570\u6574\u6570\u52a0\u6cd5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u5206\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u8bcd\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u9f50\u9519\u8bef\u6210\u56e0\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fdb\u4f4d\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u4f4d\u6570\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u8fdb\u4f4d\u5931\u8d25\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff1b\u5bf9\u9f50\u9519\u8bef\u4e0e\u5206\u8bcd\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u8fdb\u4f4d\u9519\u8bef\u5448\u968f\u673a\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u7b97\u672f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5176\u6839\u6e90\u90e8\u5206\u6765\u81ea\u5206\u8bcd\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u968f\u673a\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u672c\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing UQ approaches for MLIPs are often limited by high computational cost or suboptimal performance. Evidential deep learning (EDL) provides a theoretically grounded single-model alternative that determines both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in a single forward pass. However, extending evidential formulations from scalar targets to vector-valued quantities such as atomic forces introduces substantial challenges, particularly in maintaining statistical self-consistency under rotational transformations. To address this, we propose \\textit{Equivariant Evidential Deep Learning for Interatomic Potentials} ($\\text{e}^2$IP), a backbone-agnostic framework that models atomic forces and their uncertainty jointly by representing uncertainty as a full $3\\times3$ symmetric positive definite covariance tensor that transforms equivariantly under rotations. Experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks show that $\\text{e}^2$IP provides a stronger accuracy-efficiency-reliability balance than the non-equivariant evidential baseline and the widely used ensemble method.

Existing methods primarily rely on a direct text-to-HOI mapping, which suffers from three key limitations due to the significant cross-modality gap: (Q1) sub-optimal human motion, (Q2) unnatural object motion, and (Q3) weak interaction between humans and objects. To address these challenges, we propose MP-HOI, a novel framework grounded in four core insights: (1) Multimodal Data Priors: We leverage multimodal data (text, image, pose/object) from large multimodal models as priors to guide HOI generation, which tackles Q1 and Q2 in data modeling. (2) Enhanced Object Representation: We improve existing object representations by incorporating geometric keypoints, contact features, and dynamic properties, enabling expressive object representations, which tackles Q2 in data representation.

Our approach employs string matching based on suffix arrays that scales well with corpus size. To mitigate the combinatorial explosion induced by the semantic relaxation of queries, our method is built on two key algorithmic ideas: fast exact lookup enabled by a disk-aware design, and dynamic corpus-aware pruning. We theoretically show that the proposed method suppresses exponential growth in the search space with respect to query length by leveraging statistical properties of natural language. In experiments on FineWeb-Edu (Lozhkov et al., 2024) (1.4T tokens), we show that our method achieves significantly lower search latency than existing methods: infini-gram (Liu et al., 2024), infini-gram mini (Xu et al., 2025), and SoftMatcha (Deguchi et al., 2025). As a practical application, we demonstrate that our method identifies benchmark contamination in training corpora, unidentified by existing approaches.

In this work, we investigate the transfer of this paradigm to binary manifolds, a fundamental setting for generative modeling of discrete data. While $x$-prediction remains effective, we identify a latent structural mismatch that arises when it is coupled with velocity-based objectives ($v$-loss), leading to a time-dependent singular weighting that amplifies gradient sensitivity to approximation errors. Motivated by this observation, we formalize prediction-loss alignment as a necessary condition for flow matching training. We prove that re-aligning the objective to the signal space ($x$-loss) eliminates the singular weighting, yielding uniformly bounded gradients and enabling robust training under uniform timestep sampling without reliance on heuristic schedules. Finally, with alignment secured, we examine design choices specific to binary data, revealing a topology-dependent distinction between probabilistic objectives (e.g., cross-entropy) and geometric losses (e.g., mean squared error). Together, these results provide theoretical foundations and practical guidelines for robust flow matching on binary -- and related discrete -- domains, positioning signal-space alignment as a key principle for robust diffusion learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff08flow matching\uff09\u5728\u4e8c\u503c\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a7a\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\uff08x-\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u867d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff08v-\u635f\u5931\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5947\u5f02\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u653e\u5927\u68af\u5ea6\u5bf9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b-\u635f\u5931\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u91cd\u65b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u81f3\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08x-\u635f\u5931\uff09\u53ef\u6d88\u9664\u5947\u5f02\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5747\u5300\u6709\u754c\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u5747\u5300\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e8c\u503c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6982\u7387\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\uff09\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u635f\u5931\uff08\u5982\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u4f9d\u8d56\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u7a33\u5065\u6269\u6563\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5173\u952e\u539f\u5219\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e8c\u503c\u79bb\u6563\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a7a\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u901f\u5ea6\u76ee\u6807\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u63d0\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b-\u635f\u5931\u5bf9\u9f50\u539f\u5219\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u6570\u5b66\u8bc1\u660e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u91cd\u65b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u81f3\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a7a\u95f4\u53ef\u6d88\u9664\u5947\u5f02\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u68af\u5ea6\u6709\u754c\u6027\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8c\u503c\u6570\u636e\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u91cd\u65b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u81f3x-\u635f\u5931\u540e\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u53d8\u4e3a\u5747\u5300\u6709\u754c\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u6982\u7387\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u635f\u5931\u5728\u4e8c\u503c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u62d3\u6251\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5173\u952e\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e8c\u503c\u53ca\u7c7b\u4f3c\u79bb\u6563\u6570\u636e\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6269\u6563\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u5357\u3002"}}

However, developing reliable AI systems for autonomous vehicles remains a substantial challenge. Over the past decade, multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful approach to address complex problems in driving perception. Multi-task networks offer several advantages, including increased computational efficiency, real-time processing capabilities, optimized resource utilization, and improved generalization. In this study, we present AurigaNet, an advanced multi-task network architecture designed to push the boundaries of autonomous driving perception. AurigaNet integrates three critical tasks: object detection, lane detection, and drivable area instance segmentation. The system is trained and evaluated using the BDD100K dataset, renowned for its diversity in driving conditions. Key innovations of AurigaNet include its end-to-end instance segmentation capability, which significantly enhances both accuracy and efficiency in path estimation for autonomous vehicles. Experimental results demonstrate that AurigaNet achieves an 85.2% IoU in drivable area segmentation, outperforming its closest competitor by 0.7%. In lane detection, AurigaNet achieves a remarkable 60.8% IoU, surpassing other models by more than 30%. Furthermore, the network achieves an mAP@0.5:0.95 of 47.6% in traffic object detection, exceeding the next leading model by 2.9%. Additionally, we validate the practical feasibility of AurigaNet by deploying it on embedded devices such as the Jetson Orin NX, where it demonstrates competitive real-time performance.

However, limitations regarding research on this issue include: 1) the dominance of deficit-based medical models of autism, 2) sample size in qualitative research, and 3) the lack of phenomenological anchoring in computational research. To bridge the gap between phenomenological and computational approaches and overcome sample-size limitations, our research integrated three methodologies. Study A: structured phenomenological interviews with autistic individuals using the Transdiagnostic Assessment of Temporal Experience. Study B: computational analysis of an autobiographical corpus of autistic narratives built for this purpose. Study C: a replication of a computational study using narrative flow measures to assess the perceived phenomenological authenticity of autistic autobiographies. Interviews revealed that the most significant differences between the autistic and control groups concerned unpredictability of experience. Computational results mirrored these findings: the temporal lexicon in autistic narratives was significantly more negatively valenced - particularly the \"Immediacy & Suddenness\" category. Outlier analysis identified terms associated with perceived discontinuity (unpredictably, precipitously, and abruptly) as highly negative. The computational analysis of narrative flow found that the autistic narratives contained within the corpus quantifiably resemble autobiographical stories more than imaginary ones. Overall, the temporal challenges experienced by autistic individuals were shown to primarily concern lived unpredictability and stem from the contents of lived experience, and not from autistic narrative construction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6574\u5408\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbf\u8c08\u3001\u53d9\u4e8b\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u5206\u6790\u53ca\u53d9\u4e8b\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u65f6\u5e8f\u6311\u6218\u5728\u4e8e\u751f\u6d3b\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u4e2d\u2018\u5373\u65f6\u6027\u4e0e\u7a81\u7136\u6027\u2019\u8bcd\u6c47\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u8d1f\u5411\u60c5\u611f\u8272\u5f69\uff0c\u4e14\u771f\u5b9e\u53d9\u4e8b\u7279\u5f81\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u95ee\u9898\u6e90\u4e8e\u5185\u5728\u4f53\u9a8c\u800c\u975e\u53d9\u8ff0\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u7f3a\u9677\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u53ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u878d\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u7d0a\u4e71\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aA. \u4f7f\u7528\u8de8\u8bca\u65ad\u65f6\u95f4\u4f53\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u5bf9\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u4e2a\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u8bbf\u8c08\uff1bB. \u5bf9\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u81ea\u4f20\u4f53\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u6790\uff1bC. \u590d\u73b0\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e00\u9879\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d9\u4e8b\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u4f20\u4f53\u53d9\u8ff0\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bbf\u8c08\u663e\u793a\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u7fa4\u4f53\u5728\u4f53\u9a8c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u53d9\u4e8b\u4e2d\u2018\u5373\u65f6\u6027\u4e0e\u7a81\u7136\u6027\u2019\u7c7b\u8bcd\u6c47\u60c5\u611f\u503e\u5411\u66f4\u8d1f\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u5982\u2018\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5730\u2019\u2018\u7a81\u7136\u5730\u2019\u7b49\u9ad8\u8d1f\u5411\u8bcd\uff1b\u53d9\u4e8b\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u81ea\u4f20\u4f53\u6587\u672c\u6bd4\u865a\u6784\u6587\u672c\u66f4\u5177\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u6311\u6218\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u751f\u6d3b\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u6839\u690d\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u53d9\u4e8b\u5efa\u6784\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u7814\u7a76\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002"}}

However, when applied to offline historical logs, these methods suffer a critical failure: the dominance of low-quality data induces severe model collapse. We first establish the Divergence Theory of Repulsive Optimization, revealing that negative gradient updates inherently trigger exponential intensity explosion during off-policy training. This theory elucidates the inherent dilemma of existing methods, exposing their inability to reconcile variance reduction and noise imitation. To break this curse, we argue that the solution lies in rigorously identifying the latent high-quality distribution entangled within the noisy behavior policy. Accordingly, we reformulate the objective as an Optimistic Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) problem.

However, modifying the original text prompt to achieve the expected semantic adjustments often results in unintended global structure changes that disrupt user intent. Existing methods rely on empirical feature map selection for intervention, whose performance heavily depends on appropriate selection, leading to suboptimal stability. This paper tries to solve the aforementioned problem from a frequency perspective and analyzes the impact of the frequency spectrum of noisy latent variables on the hierarchical emergence of the structure framework and fine-grained textures during the generation process. We find that lower-frequency components are primarily responsible for establishing the structure framework in the early generation stage. Their influence diminishes over time, giving way to higher-frequency components that synthesize fine-grained textures. In light of this, we propose a training-free frequency modulation method utilizing a frequency-dependent weighting function with dynamic decay. This method maintains the structure framework consistency while permitting targeted semantic modifications. By directly manipulating the noisy latent variable, the proposed method avoids the empirical selection of internal feature maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving an effective balance between preserving structure and enabling semantic updates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u9891\u7387\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7ed3\u6784\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7eb9\u7406\u5c42\u7ea7\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4e\u9891\u6210\u5206\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u751f\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7ed3\u6784\u6846\u67b6\u5efa\u7acb\uff0c\u9ad8\u9891\u6210\u5206\u968f\u540e\u8d1f\u8d23\u7ec6\u8282\u7eb9\u7406\u5408\u6210\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9891\u7387\u8c03\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u9891\u7387\u4f9d\u8d56\u6743\u91cd\u51fd\u6570\u76f4\u63a5\u64cd\u7eb5\u566a\u58f0\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u4e49\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fee\u6539\u539f\u59cb\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u671f\u671b\u8bed\u4e49\u8c03\u6574\u65f6\uff0c\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u610f\u5916\u6539\u53d8\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\uff1b\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9009\u62e9\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3-free\u7684\u9891\u7387\u8c03\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9891\u7387\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8870\u51cf\u52a0\u6743\u51fd\u6570\u76f4\u63a5\u64cd\u4f5c\u566a\u58f0\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u7eb9\u7406\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u7ef4\u6301\u548c\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u4fee\u6539\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fbe\u5230\u66f4\u4f18\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u57df\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784-\u7eb9\u7406\u6f14\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9891\u7387\u8c03\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u907f\u514d\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Two complementary approaches have emerged to address these issues: token-adaptive layer execution, which reduces floating-point operations (FLOPs) by selectively bypassing layers, and quantization, which lowers memory footprint by reducing weight precision. However, naively integrating these techniques leads to additional accuracy degradation due to reduced redundancy in token-adaptive models. We propose QTALE (Quantization-Robust Token-Adaptive Layer Execution for LLMs), a novel framework that enables seamless integration of token-adaptive execution with quantization while preserving accuracy. Conventional token-adaptive methods reduce redundancy in two ways: (1) by limiting the diversity of training paths explored during fine-tuning, and (2) by lowering the number of parameters actively involved in inference. To overcome these limitations, QTALE introduces two key components: (1) a training strategy that ensures diverse execution paths are actively explored during fine-tuning, and (2) a post-training mechanism that allows flexible adjustment of the execution ratio at inference to reintroduce redundancy when needed. Experimental results show that QTALE enables seamless integration of token-adaptive layer execution with quantization, showing no noticeable accuracy difference, with the gap to quantization-only models kept below 0.5% on CommonsenseQA benchmarks. By combining token-adaptive execution for FLOPs reduction and quantization for memory savings, QTALE provides an effective solution for efficient LLM deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "QTALE\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4ee4\u724c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5c42\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\u7684\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8def\u5f84\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u53ef\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5197\u4f59\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u5197\u4f59\u964d\u4f4e\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cQTALE\u5728CommonsenseQA\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u7eaf\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u8ddd\u5c0f\u4e8e0.5%\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06\u4ee4\u724c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5c42\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u7ed3\u5408\u4f1a\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u5197\u4f59\u51cf\u5c11\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u517c\u5bb9\u4e24\u8005\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "QTALE\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u786e\u4fdd\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u88ab\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5165\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u6574\u6267\u884c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u6062\u590d\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u91cf\u5316\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "QTALE\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ee4\u724c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728CommonsenseQA\u4e0a\u4e0e\u7eaf\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u4f4e\u4e8e0.5%\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51cf\u5c11FLOPs\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "QTALE\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u517c\u5177\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u8282\u7701\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6267\u884c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Validation involved 365 mouse and human images (STED and confocal), benchmarking performance against the original AMAP via Pearson correlation and Two One-Sided T-tests (TOST).\n  Results: AMAP-APP achieved a 147-fold increase in processing speed on consumer hardware. Morphometric outputs (area, perimeter, circularity, and slit diaphragm density) showed high correlation (r>0.90) and statistical equivalence (TOST P<0.05) to the original method. Additionally, the new ROI algorithm demonstrated superior accuracy compared to the original, showing reduced deviation from manual delineations.\n  Conclusion: AMAP-APP democratizes deep learning-based podocyte morphometry.

Nonetheless, it faces persistent challenges, including the pre-selection of an optimal rank and rank-specific hyper-parameters, as well as the deployment complexity of heterogeneous-rank modules and more sophisticated LoRA derivatives. In this work, we introduce LoRA-Squeeze, a simple and efficient methodology that aims to improve standard LoRA learning by changing LoRA module ranks either post-hoc or dynamically during training}. Our approach posits that it is better to first learn an expressive, higher-rank solution and then compress it, rather than learning a constrained, low-rank solution directly. The method involves fine-tuning with a deliberately high(er) source rank, reconstructing or efficiently approximating the reconstruction of the full weight update matrix, and then using Randomized Singular Value Decomposition (RSVD) to create a new, compressed LoRA module at a lower target rank. Extensive experiments across 13 text and 10 vision-language tasks show that post-hoc compression often produces lower-rank adapters that outperform those trained directly at the target rank, especially if a small number of fine-tuning steps at the target rank is allowed.

However, existing VCoT approaches are largely confined to static scenarios and struggle to capture the temporal dynamics essential for tasks such as instruction, prediction, and camera motion. To bridge this gap, we propose TwiFF-2.7M, the first large-scale, temporally grounded VCoT dataset derived from $2.7$ million video clips, explicitly designed for dynamic visual question and answer. Accompanying this, we introduce TwiFF-Bench, a high-quality evaluation benchmark of $1,078$ samples that assesses both the plausibility of reasoning trajectories and the correctness of final answers in open-ended dynamic settings. Building on these foundations, we propose the TwiFF model, a unified modal that synergistically leverages pre-trained video generation and image comprehension capabilities to produce temporally coherent visual reasoning cues-iteratively generating future action frames and textual reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TwiFF significantly outperforms existing VCoT methods and Textual Chain-of-Thought baselines on dynamic reasoning tasks, which fully validates the effectiveness for visual question answering in dynamic scenarios.

Identifying linguistically interpretable markers of dementia can support transparent and clinically grounded screening approaches.\n  Methods: This study analyzes spontaneous speech transcripts from the DementiaBank Pitt Corpus using three linguistic representations: raw cleaned text, a part-of-speech (POS)-enhanced representation combining lexical and grammatical information, and a POS-only syntactic representation. Logistic regression and random forest models were evaluated under two protocols: transcript-level train-test splits and subject-level five-fold cross-validation to prevent speaker overlap. Model interpretability was examined using global feature importance, and statistical validation was conducted using Mann-Whitney U tests with Cliff's delta effect sizes.\n  Results: Across representations, models achieved stable performance, with syntactic and grammatical features retaining strong discriminative power even in the absence of lexical content. Subject-level evaluation yielded more conservative but consistent results, particularly for POS-enhanced and POS-only representations. Statistical analysis revealed significant group differences in functional word usage, lexical diversity, sentence structure, and discourse coherence, aligning closely with machine learning feature importance findings.\n  Conclusion: The results demonstrate that abstract linguistic features capture robust markers of early cognitive decline under clinically realistic evaluation.

To bridge this gap, this paper targets to develop a unified framework for omnibus vision-language forgery detection and grounding. In this unified setting, the {interplay} between diverse modalities and the dual requirements of simultaneous detection and localization pose a critical ``difficulty bias`` problem: the simpler veracity classification task tends to dominate the gradients, leading to suboptimal performance in fine-grained grounding during multi-task optimization. To address this challenge, we propose \\textbf{OmniVL-Guard}, a balanced reinforcement learning framework for omnibus vision-language forgery detection and grounding. Particularly, OmniVL-Guard comprises two core designs: Self-Evolving CoT Generatio and Adaptive Reward Scaling Policy Optimization (ARSPO). {Self-Evolving CoT Generation} synthesizes high-quality reasoning paths, effectively overcoming the cold-start challenge. Building upon this, {Adaptive Reward Scaling Policy Optimization (ARSPO)} dynamically modulates reward scales and task weights, ensuring a balanced joint optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniVL-Guard significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and exhibits zero-shot robust generalization across out-of-domain scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faOmniVL-Guard\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e2d\u7b80\u5355\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e3b\u5bfc\u68af\u5ea6\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u751f\u6210\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5956\u52b1\u7f29\u653e\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5747\u8861\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u6216\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u4ea4\u7ec7\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u56e0\u7b80\u5355\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e3b\u5bfc\u68af\u5ea6\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u2018\u96be\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u2019\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5e73\u8861\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOmniVL-Guard\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a1\uff09\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u751f\u6210\uff08Self-Evolving CoT Generation\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u514b\u670d\u521d\u59cb\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u4f4e\u7684\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\uff1b2\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5956\u52b1\u7f29\u653e\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08ARSPO\uff09\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u5956\u52b1\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cOmniVL-Guard\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "OmniVL-Guard\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u8861\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u96be\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We formulate this problem as a classical gradient-based optimisation. First, we propose a simple algorithm to achieve end-to-end differentiability of a given (frozen) LM and then find optimised prompts via gradient descent. Our central insight is to view LMs as functions operating on sequences of distributions over tokens (rather than the traditional view as functions on sequences of tokens). Our experiments and ablations demonstrate that our DLM-powered inversion can reliably and efficiently optimise prompts of lengths $10$ and $80$ for targets of length $20$, for several white-box LMs (out-of-the-box).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LM\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53ef\u5fae\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06LM\u89c6\u4e3a\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ee4\u724c\u5206\u5e03\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u751f\u6210\u671f\u671b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u5747\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u5173\u6ce8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9006\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u5982\u4f55\u6839\u636e\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u8f93\u51fa\u5e8f\u5217\u53cd\u63a8\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89c6\u4e3a\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ee4\u724c\u5206\u5e03\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u51bb\u7ed3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53ef\u5fae\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u4f18\u5316\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6d88\u878d\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684DLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u53cd\u6f14\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u4f18\u5316\u957f\u5ea6\u4e3a10\u548c80\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u957f\u5ea6\u4e3a20\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u8f93\u51fa\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u767d\u76d2\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u53cd\u63a8\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that integrates depth estimation into VLA models to enrich 3D feature representations. Specifically, we employ a depth estimation baseline called VGGT to extract geometry-aware 3D cues from standard RGB inputs, enabling efficient utilization of existing large-scale 2D datasets while implicitly recovering 3D structural information. To further enhance the reliability of these depth-derived features, we introduce a new module called action assistant, which constrains the learned 3D representations with action priors and ensures their consistency with downstream control tasks. By fusing the enhanced 3D features with conventional 2D visual tokens, our approach significantly improves the generalization ability and robustness of VLA models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only strengthens perception in geometrically ambiguous scenarios but also leads to superior action prediction accuracy.

In modern overparameterized models, forming or inverting $F\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times d}$ is prohibitive, motivating scalable influence computation via random projection with a sketch $P \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times d}$. This practice is commonly justified via the Johnson--Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma, which ensures approximate preservation of Euclidean geometry for a fixed dataset. However, JL does not address how sketching behaves under inversion. Furthermore, there is no existing theory that explains how sketching interacts with other widely-used techniques, such as ridge regularization and structured curvature approximations.\n  We develop a unified theory characterizing when projection provably preserves influence functions. When $g,g^{\\prime}\\in\\text{range}(F)$, we show that: 1) Unregularized projection: exact preservation holds iff $P$ is injective on $\\text{range}(F)$, which necessitates $m\\geq \\text{rank}(F)$; 2) Regularized projection: ridge regularization fundamentally alters the sketching barrier, with approximation guarantees governed by the effective dimension of $F$ at the regularization scale; 3) Factorized influence: for Kronecker-factored curvatures $F=A\\otimes E$, the guarantees continue to hold for decoupled sketches $P=P_A\\otimes P_E$, even though such sketches exhibit row correlations that violate i.i.d. assumptions. Beyond this range-restricted setting, we analyze out-of-range test gradients and quantify a \\emph{leakage} term that arises when test gradients have components in $\\ker(F)$. This yields guarantees for influence queries on general test points.\n  Overall, this work develops a novel theory that characterizes when projection provably preserves influence and provides principled guidance for choosing the sketch size in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u968f\u673a\u6295\u5f71\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u4ee3\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6295\u5f71\u5bf9\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u65e0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3001\u5e26\u5cad\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3001\u5206\u89e3\u578b\u66f2\u7387\uff09\u6295\u5f71\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u6295\u5f71\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5e94\u57fa\u4e8e\u66f2\u7387\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u8303\u56f4\u9650\u5236\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u68af\u5ea6\u8d85\u51fa\u8303\u56f4\u65f6\u7684\u6cc4\u6f0f\u9879\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e00\u822c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u70b9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u67e5\u8be2\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6216\u6c42\u9006\u66f2\u7387\u77e9\u9635F\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u6295\u5f71\uff08sketching\uff09\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\uff08\u5982Johnson-Lindenstrauss\u5f15\u7406\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u6295\u5f71\u5728\u53cd\u6f14\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u6db5\u76d6\u4e0e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u66f2\u7387\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5408\u7406\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6295\u5f71\u77e9\u9635P\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u65e0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\uff0c\u6295\u5f71\u7cbe\u786e\u4fdd\u7559\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u5f53\u4e14\u4ec5\u5f53P\u5728F\u7684\u50cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u662f\u5355\u5c04\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u5cad\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u540e\uff0c\u5176\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6027\u80fd\u7531F\u5728\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7ef4\u5ea6\u51b3\u5b9a\uff1b3\uff09\u5bf9\u4e8e\u514b\u7f57\u5185\u514b\u79ef\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u77e9\u9635\uff08A\u2297E\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528\u5177\u6709\u884c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u6295\u5f71\uff08P=P_A\u2297P_E\uff09\uff0c\u4ecd\u53ef\u4fdd\u6301\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5728F\u50cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u2018\u6cc4\u6f0f\u2019\u9879\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6295\u5f71\u53ef\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u4fdd\u7559\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u65e0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3001\u6709\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u53ca\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u66f2\u7387\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u6295\u5f71\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5efa\u8bae\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5982\u4f55\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u6295\u5f71\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u8981\u6c42\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u89e3\u8026\u6295\u5f71\u5728\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u6709\u6548\uff1b\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6cc4\u6f0f\u9879\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5230\u4e00\u822c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6295\u5f71\u4fdd\u7559\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u5927\u5c0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u66f2\u7387\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Unlike many clustering methods, HAC does not optimize a single explicit global objective; clustering quality is therefore primarily evaluated empirically, and the choice of linkage function plays a crucial role in practice. However, popular classical linkages, such as single-linkage, average-linkage and Ward's method show high variability across real-world datasets and do not consistently produce high-quality clusterings in practice.\n  In this paper, we propose \\emph{Chamfer-linkage}, a novel linkage function that measures the distance between clusters using the Chamfer distance, a popular notion of distance between point-clouds in machine learning and computer vision. We argue that Chamfer-linkage satisfies desirable concept representation properties that other popular measures struggle to satisfy. Theoretically, we show that Chamfer-linkage HAC can be implemented in $O(n^2)$ time, matching the efficiency of classical linkage functions. Experimentally, we find that Chamfer-linkage consistently yields higher-quality clusterings than classical linkages such as average-linkage and Ward's method across a diverse collection of datasets. Our results establish Chamfer-linkage as a practical drop-in replacement for classical linkage functions, broadening the toolkit for hierarchical clustering in both theory and practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u94fe\u63a5\u51fd\u6570\u2014\u2014Chamfer-linkage\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u70b9\u4e91\u95f4\u7684Chamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u8861\u91cf\u7c07\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0O(n^2)\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u94fe\u63a5\u51fd\u6570\u6548\u7387\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5e73\u5747\u94fe\u63a5\u548cWard\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u5178\u94fe\u63a5\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ecf\u5178\u94fe\u63a5\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5982\u5355\u94fe\u3001\u5e73\u5747\u94fe\u3001Ward\u6cd5\uff09\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u805a\u7c7b\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u65b0\u94fe\u63a5\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faChamfer-linkage\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u70b9\u4e91\u95f4\u7684Chamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u5b9a\u4e49\u7c07\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0O(n^2)\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cChamfer-linkage consistently\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5e73\u5747\u94fe\u63a5\u548cWard\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Chamfer-linkage\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7406\u8bba\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5b9e\u8df5\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u94fe\u63a5\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u5178\u94fe\u63a5\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

Existing methods predominantly operate within a 2D manifold, neglecting the underlying 3D geometry where view-dependent vertical facades (macro-structure) and scale variations (micro-scale) severely corrupt feature alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose (MGS)$^2$, a geometry-grounded framework. The core of our innovation is the Macro-Geometric Structure Filtering (MGSF) module. Unlike pixel-wise matching sensitive to noise, MGSF leverages dilated geometric gradients to physically filter out high-frequency facade artifacts while enhancing the view-invariant horizontal plane, directly addressing the domain shift. To guarantee robust input for this structural filtering, we explicitly incorporate a Micro-Geometric Scale Adaptation (MGSA) module. MGSA utilizes depth priors to dynamically rectify scale discrepancies via multi-branch feature fusion. Furthermore, a Geometric-Appearance Contrastive Distillation (GACD) loss is designed to strictly discriminate against oblique occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that (MGS)$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance, recording a Recall@1 of 97.5\\% on University-1652 and 97.02\\% on SUES-200. Furthermore, the framework exhibits superior cross-dataset generalization against geometric ambiguity.

Capturing this perceptual pathway is key to building natural full-duplex interactive systems. We introduce a framework that models this process as multi-level perception, and then reasons over conversational behaviors via a Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT). Our approach formalizes the intent-to-action pathway with a hierarchical labeling scheme, predicting high-level communicative intents and low-level speech acts to learn their causal and temporal dependencies. To train this system, we develop a high quality corpus that pairs controllable, event-rich dialogue data with human-annotated labels. The GoT framework structures streaming predictions as an evolving graph, enabling a transformer to forecast the next speech act, generate concise justifications for its decisions, and dynamically refine its reasoning. Experiments on both synthetic and real duplex dialogues show that the framework delivers robust behavior detection, produces interpretable reasoning chains, and establishes a foundation for benchmarking conversational reasoning in full duplex spoken dialogue systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u5c42\u7ea7\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08GoT\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u542b\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u9884\u6d4b\u9ad8\u9636\u4ea4\u9645\u610f\u56fe\u4e0e\u4f4e\u9636\u8bdd\u8bed\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u5176\u56e0\u679c\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6807\u7b7e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002GoT\u5c06\u6d41\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u56fe\uff0c\u4f7fTransformer\u80fd\u591f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bdd\u8bed\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u751f\u6210\u7b80\u6d01\u63a8\u7406\u7406\u7531\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u5224\u65ad\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5168\u53cc\u5de5\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u4e3a\u5168\u53cc\u5de5\u8bed\u97f3\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5168\u53cc\u5de5\u4ea4\u4e92\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u9690\u542b\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u7136\u6d41\u7545\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u610f\u56fe\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u95f4\u56e0\u679c\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u5c42\u7ea7\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6848\u9884\u6d4b\u9ad8\u9636\u4ea4\u9645\u610f\u56fe\u4e0e\u4f4e\u9636\u8bdd\u8bed\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u53ef\u63a7\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e30\u5bcc\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08GoT\uff09\u5c06\u6d41\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u56fe\uff0c\u4f7fTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u4e00\u8bdd\u8bed\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u7406\u7531\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u4fee\u6b63\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5168\u53cc\u5de5\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6e05\u6670\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u4e3a\u5168\u53cc\u5de5\u8bed\u97f3\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u8861\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u7ea7\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7406\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u9690\u542b\u601d\u7ef4\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5168\u53cc\u5de5\u4ea4\u4e92\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u667a\u80fd\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Although large language models (LLMs) have been explored for this task, evaluation is still dominated by toy-sized or synthetic benchmarks, masking the difficulty of industrial problems with $10^{3}$--$10^{6}$ (or more) variables and constraints. A key bottleneck is the lack of benchmarks that align natural-language specifications with reference formulations/solver code grounded in real optimization models. To fill in this gap, we introduce MIPLIB-NL, built via a structure-aware reverse construction methodology from real mixed-integer linear programs in MIPLIB~2017. Our pipeline (i) recovers compact, reusable model structure from flat solver formulations, (ii) reverse-generates natural-language specifications explicitly tied to this recovered structure under a unified model--data separation format, and (iii) performs iterative semantic validation through expert review and human--LLM interaction with independent reconstruction checks. This yields 223 one-to-one reconstructions that preserve the mathematical content of the original instances while enabling realistic natural-language-to-optimization evaluation.

However, it remains challenging due to cluttered backgrounds, severe scale variation, and large orientation changes. Existing approaches largely improve performance through multi-scale feature fusion with feature pyramid networks or contextual modeling with attention, but they often lack explicit foreground modeling and do not leverage geometric orientation priors, which limits feature discriminability. To overcome these limitations, we propose FGAA-FPN, a Foreground-Guided Angle-Aware Feature Pyramid Network for oriented object detection. FGAA-FPN is built on a hierarchical functional decomposition that accounts for the distinct spatial resolution and semantic abstraction across pyramid levels, thereby strengthening multi-scale representations. Concretely, a Foreground-Guided Feature Modulation module learns foreground saliency under weak supervision to enhance object regions and suppress background interference in low-level features. In parallel, an Angle-Aware Multi-Head Attention module encodes relative orientation relationships to guide global interactions among high-level semantic features.

Traditional approaches rely on supervised training with word-level aligned data, which is difficult to collect at scale and thus depends on synthetic alignments using language-specific heuristics that are suboptimal. We propose Hibiki-Zero, which eliminates the need for word-level alignments entirely. This fundamentally simplifies the training pipeline and enables seamless scaling to diverse languages with varying grammatical structures, removing the bottleneck of designing language-specific alignment heuristics. We first train on sentence-level aligned data to learn speech translation at high latency, then apply a novel reinforcement learning strategy using GRPO to optimize latency while preserving translation quality. Hibiki-Zero achieves state-of-the-art performance in translation accuracy, latency, voice transfer, and naturalness across five X-to-English tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model can be adapted to support a new input language with less than 1000h of speech.

Procedural alternatives introduce stepwise generation but often rely on mechanism-specific supervision, discrete symbolic edits, and computationally expensive inference. In this work, we propose LatentRxnFlow, a new reaction prediction paradigm that models reactions as continuous latent trajectories anchored at the thermodynamic product state. Built on Conditional Flow Matching, our approach learns time-dependent latent dynamics directly from standard reactant-product pairs, without requiring mechanistic annotations or curated intermediate labels. While LatentRxnFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on USPTO benchmarks, more importantly, the continuous formulation exposes the full generative trajectory, enabling trajectory-level diagnostics that are difficult to realize with discrete or one-shot models. We show that latent trajectory analysis allows us to localize and characterize failure modes and to mitigate certain errors via gated inference. Furthermore, geometric properties of the learned trajectories provide an intrinsic signal of epistemic uncertainty, helping prioritize reliably predictable reaction outcomes and flag ambiguous cases for additional validation. Overall, LatentRxnFlow combines strong predictive accuracy with improved transparency, diagnosability, and uncertainty awareness, moving reaction prediction toward more trustworthy deployment in high-throughput discovery workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "LatentRxnFlow \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6807\u51c6\u53cd\u5e94\u7269-\u4ea7\u7269\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u673a\u5236\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u4e2d\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u6807\u7b7e\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728 USPTO \u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u8bef\u5dee\u7f13\u89e3\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u53d1\u73b0\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53cd\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u4e3a\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u53cd\u5e94\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\uff1b\u867d\u7136\u6b65\u9aa4\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5b9a\u673a\u7406\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u79bb\u6563\u7b26\u53f7\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u673a\u5236\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6784\u5efa\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u53cd\u5e94\u7269-\u4ea7\u7269\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u673a\u5236\u6ce8\u91ca\u6216\u4e2d\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u8def\u5f84\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5728 USPTO \u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u95e8\u63a7\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8f68\u8ff9\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5185\u5728\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u53cd\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "LatentRxnFlow \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u5177\u5907\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u53cd\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u5411\u66f4\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u53d1\u73b0\u5e94\u7528\u6f14\u8fdb\u3002"}}

However, the utility of GFMs has not been fully explored for high-value use cases. This study aims to explore the utility, challenges and opportunities associated with the application of GFMs for ecological uses. In this regard, we fine-tune several pretrained AI models, namely, Prithvi-E0-2.0 and TerraMind, across three use cases, and compare this with a baseline ResNet-101 model. Firstly, we demonstrate TerraMind's LULC generation capabilities. Lastly, we explore the utility of the GFMs in forest functional trait mapping and peatlands detection. In all experiments, the GFMs outperform the baseline ResNet models. In general TerraMind marginally outperforms Prithvi.

Tax law exemplifies these challenges, as correct answers require exact statutory citation, structured legal argumentation, and numerical accuracy under rigid grading schemes. We algorithmically generate SteuerEx, the first open benchmark derived from authentic German university tax law examinations. SteuerEx comprises 115 expert-validated examination questions spanning six core tax law domains and multiple academic levels, and employs a statement-level, partial-credit evaluation framework that closely mirrors real examination practice. We further present SteuerLLM, a domain-adapted LLM for German tax law trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset generated from authentic examination material using a controlled retrieval-augmented pipeline. SteuerLLM (28B parameters) consistently outperforms general-purpose instruction-tuned models of comparable size and, in several cases, substantially larger systems, demonstrating that domain-specific data and architectural adaptation are more decisive than parameter scale for performance on realistic legal reasoning tasks. All benchmark data, training datasets, model weights, and evaluation code are released openly to support reproducible research in domain-specific legal artificial intelligence.

Existing methods attempt to reduce distributional shifts by aligning manually selected graph elements (e.g., node attributes or structural statistics), which typically require manually designed graph filters to extract relevant features before alignment. However, such approaches are inflexible: they rely on scenario-specific heuristics, and struggle when dominant discrepancies vary across transfer scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{ADAlign}, an Adaptive Distribution Alignment framework for GDA. Unlike heuristic methods, ADAlign requires no manual specification of alignment criteria. It automatically identifies the most relevant discrepancies in each transfer and aligns them jointly, capturing the interplay between attributes, structures, and their dependencies. This makes ADAlign flexible, scenario-aware, and robust to diverse and dynamically evolving shifts. To enable this adaptivity, we introduce the Neural Spectral Discrepancy (NSD), a theoretically principled parametric distance that provides a unified view of cross-graph shifts. NSD leverages neural characteristic function in the spectral domain to encode feature-structure dependencies of all orders, while a learnable frequency sampler adaptively emphasizes the most informative spectral components for each task via minimax paradigm.

Our primary finding is that despite operating in high-dimensional parameter spaces ($d=128$), transformer training trajectories rapidly collapse onto low-dimensional execution manifolds of dimension $3$--$4$. This dimensional collapse is robust across random seeds and moderate task difficulties, though the orientation of the manifold in parameter space varies between runs. We demonstrate that this geometric structure underlies several empirically observed phenomena: (1) sharp attention concentration emerges as saturation along routing coordinates within the execution manifold, (2) stochastic gradient descent (SGD) exhibits approximately integrable dynamics when projected onto the execution subspace, with non-integrability confined to orthogonal staging directions, and (3) sparse autoencoders capture auxiliary routing structure but fail to isolate execution itself, which remains distributed across the low-dimensional manifold. Our results suggest a unifying geometric framework for understanding transformer learning, where the vast majority of parameters serve to absorb optimization interference while core computation occurs in a dramatically reduced subspace. These findings have implications for interpretability, training curriculum design, and understanding the role of overparameterization in neural network learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7b97\u672f\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u9ad8\u8fbe128\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f68\u8ff9\u5374\u8fc5\u901f\u574d\u7f29\u52303-4\u7ef4\u7684\u6267\u884c\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u3002\u8be5\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u968f\u673a\u79cd\u5b50\u548c\u4e2d\u7b49\u96be\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u6d41\u5f62\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u968f\u8fd0\u884c\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u5df2\u89c2\u6d4b\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u96c6\u4e2d\u662f\u6267\u884c\u6d41\u5f62\u5185\u8def\u7531\u5750\u6807\u7684\u9971\u548c\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5728\u6267\u884c\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53ef\u79ef\uff0c\u975e\u53ef\u79ef\u6027\u4ec5\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u6b63\u4ea4\u65b9\u5411\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6355\u6349\u8f85\u52a9\u8def\u7531\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5206\u79bb\u6838\u5fc3\u6267\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u4ecd\u5206\u5e03\u4e8e\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6d41\u5f62\u4e2d\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u53c2\u6570\u7528\u4e8e\u6291\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u800c\u6838\u5fc3\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u663e\u8457\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3Transformer\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ca\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4f5c\u7528\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5185\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7b97\u672f\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5927\u89c4\u6a21Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u7ef4\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u6267\u884c\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5bf9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u96c6\u4e2d\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u79ef\u6027\u53ca\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f68\u8ff9\u5feb\u901f\u574d\u7f29\u81f33-4\u7ef4\u6267\u884c\u6d41\u5f62\uff1b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u96c6\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u8def\u7531\u5750\u6807\u9971\u548c\uff1bSGD\u5728\u6267\u884c\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53ef\u79ef\uff1b\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u5206\u79bb\u6838\u5fc3\u6267\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "Transformer\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6d41\u5f62\u4e2d\uff0c\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u53c2\u6570\u7528\u4e8e\u5438\u6536\u4f18\u5316\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Existing benchmarks, such as SAFETUNEBED (safety-centric), VALUEBENCH (value-centric), and WORLDVIEW-BENCH (culture-centric), primarily evaluate these dimensions in isolation and therefore provide limited insight into their interactions and trade-offs. More recent efforts, including MIB and INTERPRETABILITY BENCHMARK-based on mechanistic interpretability, offer valuable perspectives on model failures; however, they remain insufficient for systematically characterizing cross-dimensional trade-offs. To address these gaps, we introduce MisAlign-Profile, a unified benchmark for measuring misalignment trade-offs inspired by mechanistic profiling. First, we construct MISALIGNTRADE, an English misaligned-aligned dataset across 112 normative domains taxonomies, including 14 safety, 56 value, and 42 cultural domains.

In contrast to SR artifacts arising from synthetic LR images created under well-defined scenarios, those distortions are highly unpredictable and vary significantly across different real-life contexts. Consequently, assessing the quality of SR images (SR-IQA) obtained from realistic LR, remains a challenging and underexplored problem. In this work, we introduce a no-reference SR-IQA approach tailored for such highly ill-posed realistic settings. The proposed method enables domain-adaptive IQA for real-world SR applications, particularly in data-scarce domains. We hypothesize that degradations in super-resolved images are strongly dependent on the underlying SR algorithms, rather than being solely determined by image content. To this end, we introduce a self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy that first pretrains multiple SR model oriented representations in a pretext stage. Our contrastive learning framework forms positive pairs from images produced by the same SR model and negative pairs from those generated by different methods, independent of image content. The proposed approach S3 RIQA, further incorporates targeted preprocessing to extract complementary quality information and an auxiliary task to better handle the various degradation profiles associated with different SR scaling factors. To this end, we constructed a new dataset, SRMORSS, to support unsupervised pretext training; it includes a wide range of SR algorithms applied to numerous real LR images, which addresses a gap in existing datasets. Experiments on real SR-IQA benchmarks demonstrate that S3 RIQA consistently outperforms most state-of-the-art relevant metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08SR-IQA\uff09\u7684\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u65b9\u6cd5S3 RIQA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u53d6\u7531\u4e0d\u540c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u9000\u5316\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u91cd\u5efa\u9762\u4e34\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709SR-IQA\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u79cd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u771f\u5b9e\u590d\u6742\u9000\u5316\u7684\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6784\u5efa\u6b63\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\uff08\u540c\u4e00SR\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u4e3a\u6b63\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u4e3a\u8d1f\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9SR\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u5173\u9000\u5316\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u9884\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u53d6\u4e92\u8865\u8d28\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u4e0b\u7684\u9000\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6SRMORSS\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cS3 RIQA\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u6d41\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "S3 RIQA\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u9000\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7b97\u6cd5\u800c\u975e\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Standard machine learning intuition suggests that training with more unique training samples yields better generalization. Counterintuitively, we show that SFT benefits from repetition: under a fixed update budget, training for more epochs on smaller datasets outperforms single-epoch training on larger datasets. On AIME'24/25 and GPQA benchmarks, Olmo3-7B trained for 128 epochs on 400 samples outperforms the equivalent 1 epoch on 51200 samples by 12-26 percentage points, with no additional catastrophic forgetting. We find that training token accuracy reliably signals when repetition has saturated; improvements from additional epochs plateau at full memorization, a pattern consistent across all settings. These findings provide a practical approach for reasoning SFT, where scaling epochs with token accuracy as a stopping criterion can replace expensive undirected data scaling.

However, reproducible comparisons has been limited by ethical constraints in human studies and the lack of open benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a new dataset, the first reproducible benchmark for PD prediction. It is constructed from long-term ECoG recordings of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced rat models and annotated with neural responses measured before and after electrical stimulation. In addition, we propose a Swap-Adversarial Framework (SAF) that mitigates high inter-subject variability and the high-dimensional low-sample-size (HDLSS) problem in ECoG data, while achieving robust domain generalization across ECoG and EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) datasets. The framework integrates (1) robust preprocessing, (2) Inter-Subject Balanced Channel Swap (ISBCS) for cross-subject augmentation, and (3) domain-adversarial training to suppress subject-specific bias. ISBCS randomly swaps channels between subjects to reduce inter-subject variability, and domain-adversarial training jointly encourages the model to learn task-relevant shared features. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive experiments under cross-subject, cross-session, and cross-dataset settings.

However, ride-hailing forecasting faces significant challenges due to geospatial heterogeneity and high susceptibility to external events. This paper proposes MVGR-Net(Multi-View Geospatial Representation Learning), a novel framework that addresses these challenges through a two-stage approach. In the pretraining stage, we learn comprehensive geospatial representations by integrating Points-of-Interest and temporal mobility patterns to capture regional characteristics from both semantic attribute and temporal mobility pattern views. The forecasting stage leverages these representations through a prompt-empowered framework that fine-tunes Large Language Models while incorporating external events.

While consistency models (CMs) represent a state-of-the-art distillation-based approach for efficient generation, their large-scale application is still limited by two key issues: training instability and inflexible sampling. Existing methods seek to mitigate these problems through architectural adjustments or regularized objectives, yet overlook the critical reliance on trajectory selection. In this work, we first conduct an analysis on these two limitations: training instability originates from loss divergence induced by unstable self-supervised term, whereas sampling inflexibility arises from error accumulation. Based on these insights and analysis, we propose the Dual-End Consistency Model (DE-CM) that selects vital sub-trajectory clusters to achieve stable and effective training. DE-CM decomposes the PF-ODE trajectory and selects three critical sub-trajectories as optimization targets. Specifically, our approach leverages continuous-time CMs objectives to achieve few-step distillation and utilizes flow matching as a boundary regularizer to stabilize the training process. Furthermore, we propose a novel noise-to-noisy (N2N) mapping that can map noise to any point, thereby alleviating the error accumulation in the first step. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of our method: it achieves a state-of-the-art FID score of 1.70 in one-step generation on the ImageNet 256x256 dataset, outperforming existing CM-based one-step approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDual-End Consistency Model\uff08DE-CM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u5173\u952e\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u7c07\u89e3\u51b3\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u50f5\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u8fb9\u754c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c11\u6b65\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u5230\u566a\u58f0\uff08N2N\uff09\u6620\u5c04\u7f13\u89e3\u521d\u59cb\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u5728ImageNet 256x256\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b01.70\u7684FID\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u8c03\u6574\u6216\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u6e90\u4e8e\u635f\u5931\u53d1\u6563\uff0c\u91c7\u6837\u50f5\u5316\u6e90\u4e8e\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\uff1b\u63d0\u51faDE-CM\uff0c\u5206\u89e3PF-ODE\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u9009\u53d6\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u8fb9\u754c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u5230\u566a\u58f0\uff08N2N\uff09\u6620\u5c04\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u521d\u59cb\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet 256x256\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b01.70\u7684FID\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4e3a\u5355\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DE-CM\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u952e\u8f68\u8ff9\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u521b\u65b0\u7684N2N\u6620\u5c04\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e0e\u91c7\u6837\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u4e0e\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on autonomous driving benchmarks, suggesting their potential for general traffic understanding and navigation-related reasoning. However, existing evaluations are predominantly vehicle-centric and fail to assess perception and reasoning from a cyclist-centric viewpoint. To address this gap, we introduce CyclingVQA, a diagnostic benchmark designed to probe perception, spatio-temporal understanding, and traffic-rule-to-lane reasoning from a cyclist's perspective. Evaluating 31+ recent VLMs spanning general-purpose, spatially enhanced, and autonomous-driving-specialized models, we find that current models demonstrate encouraging capabilities, while also revealing clear areas for improvement in cyclist-centric perception and reasoning, particularly in interpreting cyclist-specific traffic cues and associating signs with the correct navigational lanes. Notably, several driving-specialized models underperform strong generalist VLMs, indicating limited transfer from vehicle-centric training to cyclist-assistive scenarios. Finally, through systematic error analysis, we identify recurring failure modes to guide the development of more effective cyclist-assistive intelligent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CyclingVQA\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u9a91\u884c\u8005\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u65f6\u7a7a\u7406\u89e3\u53ca\u4ea4\u901a\u89c4\u5219\u5230\u8f66\u9053\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8631\u4e2a\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684VLM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5177\u5907\u4e00\u5b9a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9a91\u884c\u8005\u7279\u5b9a\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6807\u5fd7\u4e0e\u6b63\u786e\u8f66\u9053\u5173\u8054\u4e0a\u4ecd\u6709\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u53cd\u800c\u4e0d\u5982\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8f66\u8f86\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bad\u7ec3\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u9a91\u884c\u8f85\u52a9\u573a\u666f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5e38\u89c1\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9a91\u884c\u8f85\u52a9\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u4ee5\u8f66\u8f86\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ece\u9a91\u884c\u8005\u89c6\u89d2\u51fa\u53d1\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u800c\u9a91\u884c\u8005\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u4ea4\u901a\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u8bf8\u591a\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u652f\u6301\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u9a91\u884c\u8005\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u63a8\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCyclingVQA\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u65f6\u7a7a\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u4ea4\u901a\u89c4\u5219\u5230\u8f66\u9053\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f3031+\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41VLM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u901a\u7528\u578b\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u53ca\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524dVLM\u5728\u9a91\u884c\u8005\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u5b9a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u89e3\u8bfb\u9a91\u884c\u8005\u4e13\u5c5e\u4ea4\u901a\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u6807\u5fd7\u4e0e\u8f66\u9053\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u77ed\u677f\uff1b\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4f4e\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u8f66\u8f86\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u9a91\u884c\u8f85\u52a9\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "CyclingVQA\u4e3a\u9a91\u884c\u8005\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9a91\u884c\u8005\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u9a91\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u652f\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

To capture modern representation learning, we treat the state and action spaces as general compact metric spaces and assume Lipschitz policies. To explain the gap between worst-case hardness and empirical success, we introduce problem distributions generated by a reference policy $q$, including a latent-variable model in which proofs exhibit reusable cut/lemma/sketch structure represented by a proof DAG. Under a top-$k$ search protocol and Tsybakov-type margin conditions, we derive lower bounds on finite-horizon success probability that decompose into search and learning terms, with learning controlled by sequential Rademacher/covering complexity. Our main separation result shows that when cut elimination expands a DAG of depth $D$ into a cut-free tree of size $\u03a9(\u039b^D)$ while the cut-aware hierarchical process has size $O(\u03bb^D)$ with $\u03bb\\ll\u039b$, a flat (cut-free) learner provably requires exponentially more data than a cut-aware hierarchical learner.

In this work, we present RSHallu, a systematic study with three deliverables: (1) we formalize RS hallucinations with an RS-oriented taxonomy and introduce image-level hallucination to capture RS-specific inconsistencies beyond object-centric errors (e.g., modality, resolution, and scene-level semantics); (2) we build a hallucination benchmark RSHalluEval (2,023 QA pairs) and enable dual-mode checking, supporting high-precision cloud auditing and low-cost reproducible local checking via a compact checker fine-tuned on RSHalluCheck dataset (15,396 QA pairs); and (3) we introduce a domain-tailored dataset RSHalluShield (30k QA pairs) for training-friendly mitigation and further propose training-free plug-and-play strategies, including decoding-time logit correction and RS-aware prompting. Across representative RS-MLLMs, our mitigation improves the hallucination-free rate by up to 21.63 percentage points under a unified protocol, while maintaining competitive performance on downstream RS tasks (RSVQA/RSVG).

However, attempts to further improve LoopLM reasoning with reinforcement learning have failed - standard objectives such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) only assign credit to the final latent state, creating a fundamental mismatch with the model's internal computation. To resolve this, we introduce RLTT (Reward Latent Thought Trajectories), a reinforcement learning framework which distributes reward across the full latent reasoning trajectory. RLTT provides dense, trajectory-level credit assignment without relying on external verifiers and can directly replace GRPO with negligible overhead. Across extensive experiments with Ouro-2.6B-Thinking under identical training and inference conditions, RLTT yields substantial improvements over GRPO on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, improving accuracy by +14.4% on MATH-500, +16.6% on AIME24, and +10.0% on BeyondAIME.

Through systematic investigation, we uncover the mechanisms underlying these bottlenecks, revealing that simple yet principled solutions suffice: base-policy transitions serve as an essential value anchor for implicit warmup, and critic normalization effectively restores representation sensitivity for discerning value differences.

A Data-Centric Perspective on VLM Post-Training", "comment": null, "summary": "The adaptation of large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through post-training reveals a pronounced generalization gap: models fine-tuned with Reinforcement Learning (RL) consistently achieve superior out-of-distribution (OOD) performance compared to those trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This paper posits a data-centric explanation for this phenomenon, contending that RL's generalization advantage arises from an implicit data filtering mechanism that inherently prioritizes medium-difficulty training samples. To test this hypothesis, we systematically evaluate the OOD generalization of SFT models across training datasets of varying difficulty levels. Our results confirm that data difficulty is a critical factor, revealing that training on hard samples significantly degrades OOD performance. Motivated by this finding, we introduce Difficulty-Curated SFT (DC-SFT), a straightforward method that explicitly filters the training set based on sample difficulty. Experiments show that DC-SFT not only substantially enhances OOD generalization over standard SFT, but also surpasses the performance of RL-based training, all while providing greater stability and computational efficiency. This work offers a data-centric account of the OOD generalization gap in VLMs and establishes a more efficient pathway to achieving robust generalization.

However, this sequential generation process is notoriously slow. While caching strategies have proven effective for accelerating traditional video diffusion models, existing methods assume uniform denoising across all frames-an assumption that breaks down in autoregressive models where different video chunks exhibit varying similarity patterns at identical timesteps. In this paper, we present FlowCache, the first caching framework specifically designed for autoregressive video generation. Our key insight is that each video chunk should maintain independent caching policies, allowing fine-grained control over which chunks require recomputation at each timestep. We introduce a chunkwise caching strategy that dynamically adapts to the unique denoising characteristics of each chunk, complemented by a joint importance-redundancy optimized KV cache compression mechanism that maintains fixed memory bounds while preserving generation quality. Our method achieves remarkable speedups of 2.38 times on MAGI-1 and 6.7 times on SkyReels-V2, with negligible quality degradation (VBench: 0.87 increase and 0.79 decrease respectively). These results demonstrate that FlowCache successfully unlocks the potential of autoregressive models for real-time, ultra-long video generation-establishing a new benchmark for efficient video synthesis at scale.

Recent approaches have successfully leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate equation hypotheses, capitalizing on their vast pre-trained scientific priors. However, existing frameworks predominantly treat the LLM as a static generator, relying on prompt-level guidance to steer exploration. This paradigm fails to update the model's internal representations based on search feedback, often yielding physically inconsistent or mathematically redundant expressions. In this work, we propose PiT-PO (Physics-informed Token-regularized Policy Optimization), a unified framework that evolves the LLM into an adaptive generator via reinforcement learning. Central to PiT-PO is a dual-constraint mechanism that rigorously enforces hierarchical physical validity while simultaneously applying fine-grained, token-level penalties to suppress redundant structures. Consequently, PiT-PO aligns LLM to produce equations that are both scientifically consistent and structurally parsimonious. Empirically, PiT-PO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks and successfully discovers novel turbulence models for challenging fluid dynamics problems. We also demonstrate that PiT-PO empowers small-scale models to outperform closed-source giants, democratizing access to high-performance scientific discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPiT-PO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f7f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u4e2d\u6210\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u7ea6\u675f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u5197\u4f59\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u65b9\u7a0b\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPiT-PO\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u9876\u5c16\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u7684\u6e4d\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u8d85\u8d8a\u95ed\u6e90\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u666e\u60e0\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06LLM\u89c6\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6839\u636e\u641c\u7d22\u53cd\u9988\u66f4\u65b0\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6216\u6570\u5b66\u5197\u4f59\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPiT-PO\uff08Physics-informed Token-regularized Policy Optimization\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316LLM\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u8bcd\u5143\u7ea7\u60e9\u7f5a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u53d1\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6e4d\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u4ea6\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u5927\u578b\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u6027\u4ef7\u6bd4\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PiT-PO\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316LLM\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Our code is available https://github.com/Daraksh/Fairness_StrideNet", "summary": "Deep neural networks for chest X-ray classification achieve strong average performance, yet often underperform for specific demographic subgroups, raising critical concerns about clinical safety and equity. Existing debiasing methods frequently yield inconsistent improvements across datasets or attain fairness by degrading overall diagnostic utility, treating fairness as a post hoc constraint rather than a property of the learned representation. In this work, we propose Stride-Net (Sensitive Attribute Resilient Learning via Disentanglement and Learnable Masking with Embedding Alignment), a fairness-aware framework that learns disease-discriminative yet demographically invariant representations for chest X-ray analysis. Stride-Net operates at the patch level, using a learnable stride-based mask to select label-aligned image regions while suppressing sensitive attribute information through adversarial confusion loss. To anchor representations in clinical semantics and discourage shortcut learning, we further enforce semantic alignment between image features and BioBERT-based disease label embeddings via Group Optimal Transport. We evaluate Stride-Net on the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert benchmarks across race and intersectional race-gender subgroups. Across architectures including ResNet and Vision Transformers, Stride-Net consistently improves fairness metrics while matching or exceeding baseline accuracy, achieving a more favorable accuracy-fairness trade-off than prior debiasing approaches.

The probability of these outputs can be reduced using methods such as LLM unlearning. However, unlearning a set of data (called the forget set) can degrade model performance on other distributions where the trainer wants to retain the model's behavior. To improve this trade-off, we demonstrate that using the forget set to compute only a few uphill Gauss-Newton steps provides a conceptually simple, state-of-the-art unlearning approach for LLMs. While Gauss-Newton steps adapt Newton's method to non-linear models, it is non-trivial to efficiently and accurately compute such steps for LLMs. Hence, our approach crucially relies on parametric Hessian approximations such as Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC). We call this combined approach K-FADE (K-FAC for Distribution Erasure). Our evaluation on the WMDP and ToFU benchmarks demonstrates that K-FADE suppresses outputs from the forget set and approximates, in output space, the results of retraining without the forget set. Critically, our method does this while altering the outputs on the retain set less than previous methods. This is because K-FADE transforms a constraint on the model's outputs across the entire retain set into a constraint on the model's weights, allowing the algorithm to minimally change the model's behavior on the retain set at each step. Moreover, the unlearning updates computed by K-FADE can be reapplied later if the model undergoes further training, allowing unlearning to be cheaply maintained.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aK-FADE\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9057\u5fd8\u6570\u636e\u4ec5\u8fdb\u884c\u5c11\u91cf\u4e0a\u5761Gauss-Newton\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6d77\u68ee\u77e9\u9635\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff08\u5982K-FAC\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u5176\u4ed6\u5206\u5e03\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5e0c\u671b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559\u96c6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5c0f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5176\u66f4\u65b0\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u5e94\u7528\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7ef4\u62a4\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u7b26\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u8005\u9884\u671f\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f93\u51fa\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u4fdd\u7559\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6d88\u9664\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53c8\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5bf9\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faK-FADE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\u6267\u884c\u5c11\u91cf\u4e0a\u5761Gauss-Newton\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5229\u7528K-FAC\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6d77\u68ee\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6280\u672f\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8f93\u51fa\u7ea6\u675f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6743\u91cd\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559\u96c6\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6539\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u5728WMDP\u548cToFU\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cK-FADE\u6210\u529f\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\u76f8\u5173\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e8e\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u4e2d\u79fb\u9664\u9057\u5fd8\u6570\u636e\u540e\u7684\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559\u96c6\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u5c0f\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u652f\u6301\u540e\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u7ef4\u62a4\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "K-FADE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6982\u5ff5\u7b80\u6d01\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u6d88\u9664\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing approaches largely rely on supervised fine-tuning, encouraging surface-level token imitation rather than faithful modeling of underlying chart structure, which often leads to hallucinated or semantically inconsistent outputs. We propose Chart Specification, a structured intermediate representation that shifts training from text imitation to semantically grounded supervision. Chart Specification filters syntactic noise to construct a structurally balanced training set and supports a Spec-Align Reward that provides fine-grained, verifiable feedback on structural correctness, enabling reinforcement learning to enforce consistent plotting logic. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches. With only 3K training samples, we achieve strong data efficiency, surpassing leading baselines by up to 61.7% on complex benchmarks, and scaling to 4K samples establishes new state-of-the-art results across all evaluated metrics. Overall, our results demonstrate that precise structural supervision offers an efficient pathway to high-fidelity chart-to-code generation.

However, the redundant modeling of static regions and the lack of deep interaction with trajectories hinder world models from exerting their full effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Temporal Residual World Model (TR-World), which focuses on dynamic object modeling. By calculating the temporal residuals of scene representations, the information of dynamic objects can be extracted without relying on detection and tracking. TR-World takes only temporal residuals as input, thus predicting the future spatial distribution of dynamic objects more precisely. By combining the prediction with the static object information contained in the current BEV features, accurate future BEV features can be obtained. Furthermore, we propose Future-Guided Trajectory Refinement (FGTR) module, which conducts interaction between prior trajectories (predicted from the current scene representation) and the future BEV features. This module can not only utilize future road conditions to refine trajectories, but also provides sparse spatial-temporal supervision on future BEV features to prevent world model collapse. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes and NAVSIM datasets demonstrate that our method, namely ResWorld, achieves state-of-the-art planning performance.

West", "YangQuan Chen"], "title": "When Gradient Clipping Becomes a Control Mechanism for Differential Privacy in Deep Learning", "comment": "This manuscript is under review in the Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence journal", "summary": "Privacy-preserving training on sensitive data commonly relies on differentially private stochastic optimization with gradient clipping and Gaussian noise. The clipping threshold is a critical control knob: if set too small, systematic over-clipping induces optimization bias; if too large, injected noise dominates updates and degrades accuracy. Existing adaptive clipping methods often depend on per-example gradient norm statistics, adding computational overhead and introducing sensitivity to datasets and architectures. We propose a control-driven clipping strategy that adapts the threshold using a lightweight, weight-only spectral diagnostic computed from model parameters. At periodic probe steps, the method analyzes a designated weight matrix via spectral decomposition and estimates a heavy-tailed spectral indicator associated with training stability. This indicator is smoothed over time and fed into a bounded feedback controller that updates the clipping threshold multiplicatively in the log domain. Because the controller uses only parameters produced during privacy-preserving training, the resulting threshold updates are post-processing and do not increase privacy loss beyond that of the underlying DP optimizer under standard composition accounting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68af\u5ea6\u88c1\u526a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u8c31\u7279\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u88c1\u526a\u9608\u503c\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5468\u671f\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6307\u5b9a\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u8fdb\u884c\u8c31\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u91cd\u5c3e\u8c31\u6307\u6807\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u754c\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5728\u5bf9\u6570\u57df\u4e2d\u4e58\u6cd5\u66f4\u65b0\u9608\u503c\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u9608\u503c\u66f4\u65b0\u5c5e\u4e8e\u540e\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u9690\u79c1\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4e14\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bcf\u6837\u672c\u68af\u5ea6\u8303\u6570\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u88c1\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6bcf\u6837\u672c\u68af\u5ea6\u8303\u6570\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u4e14\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u654f\u611f\u3002\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u9690\u79c1\u6210\u672c\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u88c1\u526a\uff0c\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5468\u671f\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u6307\u5b9a\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u8fdb\u884c\u8c31\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u91cd\u5c3e\u8c31\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u5c06\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u540e\u8f93\u5165\u6709\u754c\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u6570\u57df\u4e2d\u4e58\u6cd5\u5f0f\u66f4\u65b0\u88c1\u526a\u9608\u503c\uff1b\u6574\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u9608\u503c\u66f4\u65b0\u4e3a\u540e\u5904\u7406\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u88c1\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u6d88\u8017\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u5747\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u68af\u5ea6\u8303\u6570\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u9a71\u52a8\u578b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u88c1\u526a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8c31\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0e\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u504f\u5dee\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Unified Sequence Parallelism (USP), which combines Ulysses and Ring attention mechanisms, has emerged as the state-of-the-art approach for distributed attention computation. However, existing USP implementations suffer from significant inefficiencies including excessive kernel launch overhead and suboptimal computation-communication scheduling. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{FastUSP}, a multi-level optimization framework that integrates compile-level optimization (graph compilation with CUDA Graphs and computation-communication reordering), communication-level optimization (FP8 quantized collective communication), and operator-level optimization (pipelined Ring attention with double buffering). We evaluate FastUSP on FLUX (12B) and Qwen-Image models across 2, 4, and 8 NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPUs. On FLUX, FastUSP achieves consistent \\textbf{1.12$\\times$--1.16$\\times$} end-to-end speedup over baseline USP, with compile-level optimization contributing the dominant improvement. On Qwen-Image, FastUSP achieves \\textbf{1.09$\\times$} speedup on 2 GPUs; on 4--8 GPUs, we identify a PyTorch Inductor compatibility limitation with Ring attention that prevents compile optimization, while baseline USP scales to 1.30$\\times$--1.46$\\times$ of 2-GPU performance.

Furthermore, per-token granularity is employed to align with the autoregressive decoding process and maintain quantization accuracy. (ii) Quantized PV Computation Pipeline Reconstruction, which resolves the misalignment of quantization scale in FP8 PV computation stemming from the shared KV structure of the MLA KV cache. (iii) End-to-End Dataflow Optimization, where we establish an efficient data read-and-write workflow using specialized kernels, ensuring efficient data flow and performance gains. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLA LLMs show that SnapMLA achieves up to a 1.91x improvement in throughput, with negligible risk of performance degradation in challenging long-context tasks, including mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks.

In this work, we reinterpret RoPE as phase modulation applied to a bank of complex oscillators, enabling analysis through classical signal processing theory.\n  Under this formulation, we derive principled lower bounds on the RoPE base parameter that are necessary to preserve positional coherence over a target context length. These include a fundamental aliasing bound, analogous to a Nyquist limit, and a DC-component stability bound that constrains phase drift in low-frequency positional modes. We further extend this analysis to deep transformers, showing that repeated rotary modulation across layers compounds angular misalignment, tightening the base requirement as depth increases.\n  Complementing these results, we derive a precision-dependent upper bound on the RoPE base arising from finite floating-point resolution. Beyond this limit, incremental phase updates become numerically indistinguishable, leading to positional erasure even in the absence of aliasing. Together, the lower and upper bounds define a precision- and depth-dependent feasibility region a Goldilocks zone for long-context transformers.\n  We validate the framework through a comprehensive case study of state-of-the-art models, including LLaMA, Mistral, and DeepSeek variants, showing that observed successes, failures, and community retrofits align closely with the predicted bounds. Notably, models that violate the stability bound exhibit attention collapse and long-range degradation, while attempts to scale beyond one million tokens encounter a hard precision wall independent of architecture or training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\uff08RoPE\uff09\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u5bf9\u590d\u6570\u632f\u8361\u5668\u7ec4\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u754c\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5948\u594e\u65af\u7279\u6781\u9650\u7684\u6df7\u53e0\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u4f4e\u9891\u6a21\u5f0f\u76f8\u4f4d\u6f02\u79fb\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u6df1\u5c42\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u4e2d\u591a\u5c42\u65cb\u8f6c\u8c03\u5236\u4f1a\u52a0\u5267\u89d2\u5ea6\u5931\u51c6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u57fa\u53c2\u6570\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u53d7\u6d6e\u70b9\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff1a\u8d85\u8fc7\u8be5\u503c\u540e\u76f8\u4f4d\u66f4\u65b0\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u3002\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\u5171\u540c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u2018\u6070\u5230\u597d\u5904\u2019\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u533a\u57df\u3002\u901a\u8fc7LLaMA\u3001Mistral\u3001DeepSeek\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b9e\u9645\u6210\u529f\u3001\u5931\u8d25\u53ca\u793e\u533a\u4fee\u590d\u5747\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u8fb9\u754c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u543b\u5408\uff0c\u8fdd\u53cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u574d\u7f29\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u767e\u4e07\u7ea7\u4ee4\u724c\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u4e0d\u53ef\u903e\u8d8a\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u58c1\u5792\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\uff08RoPE\uff09\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u5176\u57fa\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u6216\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5c06RoPE\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u590d\u6570\u632f\u8361\u5668\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6df7\u53e0\u5206\u6790\u3001\u9891\u7387\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u53ca\u6d6e\u70b9\u6570\u503c\u8bef\u5dee\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u4e0e\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6df7\u53e0\u4e0b\u754c\u3001\u76f8\u4f4d\u6f02\u79fb\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e0b\u754c\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u8fdd\u53cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u5c06\u5f15\u53d1\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u574d\u7f29\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u9650\u5219\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u5b8c\u5168\u4e27\u5931\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u4e0e\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u767e\u4e07\u7ea7\u4ee4\u724c\u786c\u58c1\u3002", "conclusion": "RoPE\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u2018\u9ec4\u91d1\u533a\u57df\u2019\u2014\u2014\u57fa\u53c2\u6570\u5fc5\u987b\u5728\u7531\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u51b3\u5b9a\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\u4e4b\u95f4\u3002\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u4e0d\u4ec5\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6210\u8d25\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

Tehrani", "Mohammad Mahdi Mojahedian", "Mohammad Hossein Yassaee"], "title": "TRACE: Theoretical Risk Attribution under Covariate-shift Effects", "comment": null, "summary": "When a source-trained model $Q$ is replaced by a model $\\tilde{Q}$ trained on shifted data, its performance on the source domain can change unpredictably. To address this, we study the two-model risk change, $\u0394R := R_P(\\tilde{Q}) - R_P(Q)$, under covariate shift. We introduce TRACE (Theoretical Risk Attribution under Covariate-shift Effects), a framework that decomposes $|\u0394R|$ into an interpretable upper bound. This decomposition disentangles the risk change into four actionable factors: two generalization gaps, a model change penalty, and a covariate shift penalty, transforming the bound into a powerful diagnostic tool for understanding why performance has changed. To make TRACE a fully computable diagnostic, we instantiate each term. The covariate shift penalty is estimated via a model sensitivity factor (from high-quantile input gradients) and a data-shift measure; we use feature-space Optimal Transport (OT) by default and provide a robust alternative using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The model change penalty is controlled by the average output distance between the two models on the target sample. Generalization gaps are estimated on held-out data. We validate our framework in an idealized linear regression setting, showing the TRACE bound correctly captures the scaling of the true risk difference with the magnitude of the shift. Across synthetic and vision benchmarks, TRACE diagnostics are valid and maintain a strong monotonic relationship with the true performance degradation.

Early identification is important for minimizing damage and ensuring fruit health. This study focuses on 3 different categories for classifying diseases. These are Anthracnose, Fruit flies, and Healthy fruit. The data set used in this study is collected from Mendeley Data. This dataset contains 473 original images of Guava. These images vary in size and format. The original dataset was resized to 256x256 pixels with RGB color mode for better consistency. After this, the Data augmentation process is applied to improve the dataset by generating variations of the original images. The augmented dataset consists of 3784 images using advanced preprocessing techniques. Two deep learning models were implemented to classify the images. The InceptionV3 model is well known for its advanced framework. These apply multiple convolutional filters for obtaining different features effectively. On the other hand, the ResNet50 model helps to train deeper networks by using residual learning. The InceptionV3 model achieved the impressive accuracy of 98.15%, and ResNet50got 94.46% accuracy. Data mixing methods such as CutMix and MixUp were applied to enhance the model's robustness. The confusion matrix was used to evaluate the overall model performance of both InceptionV3 and Resnet50. Additionally, SHAP analysis is used to improve interpretability, which helps to find the significant parts of the image for the model prediction.

Operating under a global compression budget, ROCKET comprises two key innovations: First, it formulates layer-wise compression allocation as a multi-choice knapsack problem, selecting the optimal compression level for each layer to minimize total reconstruction error while adhering to a target model size. Second, it introduces a single-step sparse matrix factorization inspired by dictionary learning: using only a small calibration set, it sparsifies weight coefficients based on activation-weights sensitivity and then updates the dictionary in closed form via least squares bypassing iterative optimization, sparse coding, or backpropagation entirely. ROCKET consistently outperforms existing compression approaches across different model architectures at 20-50\\% compression rates. Notably, it retains over 90\\% of the original model's performance at 30\\% compression without any fine-tuning. Moreover, when applying a light fine-tuning phase, recovery is substantially enhanced: for instance, compressing Qwen3-14B to an 8B-parameter model and healing it with just 30 million tokens yields performance nearly on par with the original Qwen3-8B.

We propose RI-FedAvg, a novel FL algorithm that mitigates client drift by incorporating a Roughness Index (RI)-based regularization term into the local objective, adaptively penalizing updates based on the fluctuations of local loss landscapes. This paper introduces RI-FedAvg, leveraging the RI to quantify the roughness of high-dimensional loss functions, ensuring robust optimization in heterogeneous settings. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis for non-convex objectives, establishing that RI-FedAvg converges to a stationary point under standard assumptions. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that RI-FedAvg outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including FedAvg, FedProx, FedDyn, SCAFFOLD, and DP-FedAvg, achieving higher accuracy and faster convergence in non-IID scenarios.

This paper introduces the DFIC dataset, a novel comprehensive facial image dataset comprising around 58,000 annotated images and 2706 videos of more than 1000 subjects, that cover a broad range of non-compliant conditions, in addition to compliant portraits. Our dataset provides a more balanced demographic distribution than the existing public datasets, with one partition that is nearly uniformly distributed, facilitating the development of automated ICAO compliance verification methods.\n  Using DFIC, we fine-tuned a novel method that heavily relies on spatial attention mechanisms for the automatic validation of ICAO compliance requirements, and we have compared it with the state-of-the-art aimed at ICAO compliance verification, demonstrating improved results. DFIC dataset is now made public (https://github.com/visteam-isr-uc/DFIC) for the training and validation of new models, offering an unprecedented diversity of faces, that will improve both robustness and adaptability to the intrinsically diverse combinations of faces and props that can be presented to the validation system. These results emphasize the potential of DFIC to enhance automated ICAO compliance methods but it can also be used in many other applications that aim to improve the security, privacy, and fairness of facial recognition systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DFIC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7ea658,000\u5f20\u6807\u6ce8\u4eba\u8138\u56fe\u50cf\u548c2706\u6bb5\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u591a\u79cd\u4e0d\u5408\u89c4\u60c5\u51b5\u53ca\u5408\u89c4\u8bc1\u4ef6\u7167\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5747\u8861\u7684\u79cd\u65cf\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684ICAO\u5408\u89c4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a7a\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5df2\u516c\u5f00\uff0c\u53ef\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4eba\u5de5\u68c0\u67e5\u9762\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\u662f\u5426\u7b26\u5408ISO/IEC\u548cICAO\u6807\u51c6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u9700\u6c42\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u8eab\u4efd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eDFIC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u4eba\u8138\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9ICAO\u5408\u89c4\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DFIC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316ICAO\u5408\u89c4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u5177\u5907\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002"}}

Recently the proposal of ''thinking with images'' attempts to alleviate this limitation by manipulating images via external tools or code; however, the resulting visual states are often insufficiently grounded in linguistic semantics, impairing effective cross-modal alignment - particularly when visual semantics or geometric relationships must be reasoned over across distant regions or multiple images. To address these challenges, we propose ''chatting with images'', a new framework that reframes visual manipulation as language-guided feature modulation. Under the guidance of expressive language prompts, the model dynamically performs joint re-encoding over multiple image regions, enabling tighter coupling between linguistic reasoning and visual state updates. We instantiate this paradigm in ViLaVT, a novel LVLM equipped with a dynamic vision encoder explicitly designed for such interactive visual reasoning, and trained it with a two-stage curriculum combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to promote effective reasoning behaviors. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks demonstrate that ViLaVT achieves strong and consistent improvements, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-image and video-based spatial reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a'chatting with images'\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u64cd\u4f5c\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u91cd\u65b0\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u72b6\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u540d\u4e3aViLaVT\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03+\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u52bf\u660e\u663e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u6b21\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\uff1b\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709'\u601d\u8003\u56fe\u50cf'\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c1d\u8bd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u6216\u4ee3\u7801\u64cd\u7eb5\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u72b6\u6001\u5f80\u5f80\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u5145\u5206\u652f\u6491\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8de8\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u533a\u57df\u6216\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u95f4\u9700\u63a8\u7406\u51e0\u4f55\u5173\u7cfb\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa'chatting with images'\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u64cd\u4f5c\u89c6\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8c03\u5236\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u91cd\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03 + \u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u7c7b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u8c03\u5236\uff0cViLaVT\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Policy staleness, asynchronous training, and mismatches between training and inference engines all cause the behavior policy to diverge from the current policy, risking training collapse. Importance sampling provides a principled correction for this distribution shift but suffers from high variance; existing remedies such as token-level clipping and sequence-level normalization lack a unified theoretical foundation. We propose Variational sEquence-level Soft Policy Optimization (VESPO). By incorporating variance reduction into a variational formulation over proposal distributions, VESPO derives a closed-form reshaping kernel that operates directly on sequence-level importance weights without length normalization. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that VESPO maintains stable training under staleness ratios up to 64x and fully asynchronous execution, and delivers consistent gains across both dense and Mixture-of-Experts models.

Standard fixed-vocabulary tokenizers fragment biologically meaningful motifs such as codons and regulatory elements, while nucleotide-level models preserve biological coherence but incur prohibitive computational costs for long contexts. We introduce dnaHNet, a state-of-the-art tokenizer-free autoregressive model that segments and models genomic sequences end-to-end. Using a differentiable dynamic chunking mechanism, dnaHNet compresses raw nucleotides into latent tokens adaptively, balancing compression with predictive accuracy. Pretrained on prokaryotic genomes, dnaHNet outperforms leading architectures including StripedHyena2 in scaling and efficiency. This recursive chunking yields quadratic FLOP reductions, enabling $>3 \\times$ inference speedup over Transformers. On zero-shot tasks, dnaHNet achieves superior performance in predicting protein variant fitness and gene essentiality, while automatically discovering hierarchical biological structures without supervision.

In this work, we adapt our previously proposed SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) mechanism to the ViT architecture, introducing a geometrically grounded formulation that enhances interpretability, sparsity, and spectral structure. We apply the use of interpretability indicators -- originally proposed with SVDA -- to monitor attention dynamics during training and assess structural properties of the learned representations. Experimental evaluations on four widely used benchmarks -- CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 -- demonstrate that SVDA consistently yields more interpretable attention patterns without sacrificing classification accuracy. While the current framework offers descriptive insights rather than prescriptive guidance, our results establish SVDA as a comprehensive and informative tool for analyzing and developing structured attention models in computer vision.

However, achieving real-time DNN inference in the AV's perception pipeline is challenging due to the large gap between the computation requirement and the AV's limited resources. Most, if not all, of existing studies focus on optimizing the DNN inference time to achieve faster perception by compressing the DNN model with pruning and quantization. In contrast, we present a Predictable Perception system with DNNs (PP-DNN) that reduce the amount of image data to be processed while maintaining the same level of accuracy for multi-tenant DNNs by dynamically selecting critical frames and regions of interest (ROIs). PP-DNN is based on our key insight that critical frames and ROIs for AVs vary with the AV's surrounding environment. However, it is challenging to identify and use critical frames and ROIs in multi-tenant DNNs for predictable inference. Given image-frame streams, PP-DNN leverages an ROI generator to identify critical frames and ROIs based on the similarities of consecutive frames and traffic scenarios. PP-DNN then leverages a FLOPs predictor to predict multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) from the dynamic critical frames and ROIs. The ROI scheduler coordinates the processing of critical frames and ROIs with multiple DNN models. Finally, we design a detection predictor for the perception of non-critical frames. We have implemented PP-DNN in an ROS-based AV pipeline and evaluated it with the BDD100K and the nuScenes dataset. PP-DNN is observed to significantly enhance perception predictability, increasing the number of fusion frames by up to 7.3x, reducing the fusion delay by >2.6x and fusion-delay variations by >2.3x, improving detection completeness by 75.4% and the cost-effectiveness by up to 98% over the baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "PP-DNN\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u548c\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\uff08ROIs\uff09\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u9700\u5904\u7406\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u79df\u6237DNN\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5229\u7528\u5e27\u95f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0e\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u548cROIs\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408FLOPs\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\uff08\u5982\u526a\u679d\u3001\u91cf\u5316\uff09\u4f18\u5316DNN\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u611f\u77e5\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u79df\u6237\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u611f\u77e5\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u3002", "method": "PP-DNN\u57fa\u4e8e\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u4e0eROI\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528ROI\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6839\u636e\u5e27\u95f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u4e0e\u533a\u57df\uff1b\u518d\u901a\u8fc7FLOPs\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u4f30\u7b97\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\uff1b\u7531ROI\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u534f\u8c03\u591a\u4e2aDNN\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u5904\u7406\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u68c0\u6d4b\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u3002\u6574\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u4e8eROS\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u611f\u77e5\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728BDD100K\u4e0enuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cPP-DNN\u4f7f\u878d\u5408\u5e27\u6570\u63d0\u53477.3\u500d\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u8d85\u8fc72.6\u500d\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6ce2\u52a8\u51cf\u5c11\u8d85\u8fc72.3\u500d\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u63d0\u9ad875.4%\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534798%\u3002", "conclusion": "PP-DNN\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u4e0e\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We introduce a training-free, token-level early stopping approach that identifies convergence independently at each position.

While deep GLAD methods have shown promising performance, their black-box nature limits their reliability and deployment in real-world applications. Although some recent methods have made attempts to provide explanations for anomaly detection results, they either provide explanations without referencing normal graphs, or rely on abstract latent vectors as prototypes rather than concrete graphs from the dataset. To address these limitations, we propose Prototype-based Graph-Level Anomaly Detection (ProtoGLAD), an interpretable unsupervised framework that provides explanation for each detected anomaly by explicitly contrasting with its nearest normal prototype graph. It employs a point-set kernel to iteratively discover multiple normal prototype graphs and their associated clusters from the dataset, then identifying graphs distant from all discovered normal clusters as anomalies. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that ProtoGLAD achieves competitive anomaly detection performance compared to state-of-the-art GLAD methods while providing better human-interpretable prototype-based explanations.", "AI": {"tldr": "ProtoGLAD \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56fe\u7ea7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5f02\u5e38\u56fe\u4e0e\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u6b63\u5e38\u539f\u578b\u56fe\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u70b9\u96c6\u6838\u8fed\u4ee3\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u4e2a\u6b63\u5e38\u539f\u578b\u56fe\u53ca\u5176\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5c06\u8fdc\u79bb\u6240\u6709\u6b63\u5e38\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u56fe\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3a\u5f02\u5e38\u3002\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cProtoGLAD \u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u9886\u5148\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u6613\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u578b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u7ea7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u9ed1\u7bb1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5df2\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u6216\u4e0d\u53c2\u8003\u6b63\u5e38\u56fe\uff0c\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5411\u91cf\u800c\u975e\u5177\u4f53\u56fe\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa ProtoGLAD \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u70b9\u96c6\u6838\u8fed\u4ee3\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u4e2a\u6b63\u5e38\u539f\u578b\u56fe\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u56fe\u4e0e\u6240\u6709\u6b63\u5e38\u539f\u578b\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u5224\u65ad\u662f\u5426\u4e3a\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u5177\u4f53\u56fe\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cProtoGLAD \u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u63a5\u8fd1\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u76f4\u89c2\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u539f\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "ProtoGLAD \u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u56fe\u7ea7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6b63\u5e38\u539f\u578b\u56fe\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We introduce SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) into the Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT), providing the first spectrally structured formulation of attention for dense prediction tasks. SVDA decouples directional alignment from spectral modulation by embedding a learnable diagonal matrix into normalized query-key interactions, enabling attention maps that are intrinsically interpretable rather than post-hoc approximations. Experiments on KITTI and NYU-v2 show that SVDA preserves or slightly improves predictive accuracy while adding only minor computational overhead. More importantly, SVDA unlocks six spectral indicators that quantify entropy, rank, sparsity, alignment, selectivity, and robustness.

However, hyperparameter optimization and scaling laws have been studied primarily from the perspective of the base model's validation loss, ignoring downstream adaptability. In this work, we study pretraining from the perspective of model plasticity, that is, the ability of the base model to successfully adapt to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. We focus on the role of weight decay, a key regularization parameter during pretraining. Through systematic experiments, we show that models trained with larger weight decay values are more plastic, meaning they show larger performance gains when fine-tuned on downstream tasks. This phenomenon can lead to counterintuitive trade-offs where base models that perform worse after pretraining can perform better after fine-tuning. Further investigation of weight decay's mechanistic effects on model behavior reveals that it encourages linearly separable representations, regularizes attention matrices, and reduces overfitting on the training data. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the importance of using evaluation metrics beyond cross-entropy loss for hyperparameter optimization and casts light on the multifaceted role of that a single optimization hyperparameter plays in shaping model behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5851\u6027\uff08\u5373\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u9002\u5e94\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff09\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\uff08weight decay\uff09\u503c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u5851\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u8868\u5f81\u3001\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e9\u9635\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u5e94\u8d85\u8d8a\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u5355\u4e00\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u591a\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u503c\u4e0b\u57fa\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8868\u73b0\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8868\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e9\u9635\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8f83\u5927\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u5851\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u5c3d\u7ba1\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u4fc3\u4f7f\u751f\u6210\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u8868\u793a\u3001\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u7eb3\u5165\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8003\u91cf\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u3002\u5355\u4e00\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u5982\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5408\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Accurate assessment is vital for adaptive learning, clinical monitoring, and brain-computer interfaces. Physiological signals such as pupillometry and electroencephalography are established biomarkers of cognitive load, but their comparative utility and practical integration as lightweight, wearable monitoring solutions remain underexplored. EEG provides high temporal resolution of neural activity. Although non-invasive, it is technologically demanding and limited in wearability and cost due to its resource-intensive nature, whereas pupillometry is non-invasive, portable, and scalable. Existing studies often rely on deep learning models with limited interpretability and substantial computational expense. This study integrates feature-based and model-driven approaches to advance time-series analysis. Using the OpenNeuro 'Digit Span Task' dataset, this study investigates cognitive load classification from EEG and pupillometry. Feature-based approaches using Catch-22 features and classical machine learning models outperform deep learning in both binary and multiclass tasks. The findings demonstrate that pupillometry alone can compete with EEG, serving as a portable and practical proxy for real-world applications. These results challenge the assumption that EEG is necessary for load detection, showing that pupil dynamics combined with interpretable models and SHAP based feature analysis provide physiologically meaningful insights.

Despite recent progress of large visual-language models and agentic AI, accurately counting such instruments remains highly challenging, particularly in dense scenarios where instruments are tightly clustered. To address this problem, we introduce Chain-of-Look, a novel visual reasoning framework that mimics the sequential human counting process by enforcing a structured visual chain, rather than relying on classic object detection which is unordered. This visual chain guides the model to count along a coherent spatial trajectory, improving accuracy in complex scenes. To further enforce the physical plausibility of the visual chain, we introduce the neighboring loss function, which explicitly models the spatial constraints inherent to densely packed surgical instruments. We also present SurgCount-HD, a new dataset comprising 1,464 high-density surgical instrument images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for counting (e.g., CountGD, REC) as well as Multimodality Large Language Models (e.g., Qwen, ChatGPT) in the challenging task of dense surgical instrument counting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faChain-of-Look\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u9010\u5e8f\u8ba1\u6570\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u94fe\u8def\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u624b\u672f\u5668\u68b0\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u8ba1\u6570\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u90bb\u8fd1\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff1b\u6784\u5efaSurgCount-HD\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u624b\u672f\u5ba4\u4e2d\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u6570\u624b\u672f\u5668\u68b0\u5bf9\u60a3\u8005\u5b89\u5168\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u6392\u5217\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56\u65e0\u5e8f\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u5e03\u5c40\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faChain-of-Look\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u94fe\u8def\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u6cbf\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u90bb\u8fd1\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4ee5\u7ea6\u675f\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728SurgCount-HD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eCountGD\u3001REC\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u8ba1\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u53caQwen\u3001ChatGPT\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u6570\u7cbe\u5ea6\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "Chain-of-Look\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba1\u6570\u903b\u8f91\u4e0e\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5bc6\u96c6\u624b\u672f\u5668\u68b0\u8ba1\u6570\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Synthetic data produced by generative artificial intelligence (genAI) models trained on real data is often seen as one possible solution to comply with privacy regulations. While powerful genAI models for heterogeneous hospital time series have recently been introduced, such modeling does not guarantee privacy protection, as the generated data may still reveal identifying information about individuals in the models' training cohort. Applying established privacy mechanisms to generative time series models, however, proves challenging as post-hoc data anonymization through k-anonymization or similar techniques is limited, while model-centered privacy mechanisms that implement differential privacy (DP) may lead to unstable training, compromising the utility of generated data. Given these known limitations, privacy audits for generative time series models are currently indispensable regardless of the concrete privacy mechanisms applied to models and/or data. In this work, we use a battery of established privacy attacks to audit state-of-the-art hospital time series models, trained on the public MIMIC-IV dataset, with respect to privacy preservation. Furthermore, the eICU dataset was used to mount a privacy attack against the synthetic data generator trained on the MIMIC-IV dataset. Results show that established privacy attacks are ineffective against generated multivariate clinical time series when synthetic data generators are trained on large enough training datasets. Furthermore, we discuss how the use of existing DP mechanisms for these synthetic data generators would not bring desired improvement in privacy, but only a decrease in utility for machine learning prediction tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eMIMIC-IV\u548ceICU\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u533b\u9662\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5df2\u77e5\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8db3\u591f\u5927\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u653b\u51fb\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff08DP\uff09\u673a\u5236\u867d\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u56e0\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u5408\u89c4\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u4ecd\u6cc4\u9732\u4e2a\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9690\u79c1\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u4fdd\u62a4\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6210\u719f\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8eMIMIC-IV\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u533b\u9662\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9690\u79c1\u5ba1\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528eICU\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9MIMIC-IV\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u653b\u51fb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u4e34\u5e8a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u6548\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5236\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u4f46\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u5229\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5177\u5907\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u7b49\u673a\u5236\u4f1a\u727a\u7272\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u6743\u8861\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e14\u5f53\u524d\u9690\u79c1\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4ecd\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u624b\u6bb5\u3002"}}

While recent advances in self-supervised depth estimation have reduced reliance on ground truth supervision, existing approaches remain constrained by either bulky architectures compromising practicality or lightweight models sacrificing structural precision. These dual limitations underscore the critical need to develop lightweight yet structurally precise architectures. Our framework addresses these limitations through a three-stage architecture incorporating three novel modules: the Shuffle-Dilation Convolution (SDC) module for local feature extraction, the Rotation-Adaptive Kernel Attention (RAKA) module for hierarchical feature enhancement, and the Deep Frequency Signal Purification (DFSP) module for global feature purification.

Boltzmann Generators (BGs) address this by combining exact-likelihood generative models with importance sampling, but their practical scalability is limited. Meanwhile, coarse-grained surrogates enable the modeling of larger systems by reducing effective dimensionality, yet often lack the reweighting process required to ensure asymptotically correct statistics. In this work, we propose Coarse-Grained Boltzmann Generators (CG-BGs), a principled framework that unifies scalable reduced-order modeling with the exactness of importance sampling. CG-BGs act in a coarse-grained coordinate space, using a learned potential of mean force (PMF) to reweight samples generated by a flow-based model. Crucially, we show that this PMF can be efficiently learned from rapidly converged data via force matching. Our results demonstrate that CG-BGs faithfully capture complex interactions mediated by explicit solvent within highly reduced representations, establishing a scalable pathway for the unbiased sampling of larger molecular systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u7c97\u7c92\u5316\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08CG-BGs\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7c97\u7c92\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u52bf\u80fd\u5e73\u5747\u529b\uff08PMF\uff09\u6765\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u6eb6\u5242\u4ecb\u5bfc\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u5927\u5206\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65e0\u504f\u91c7\u6837\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f25\u8865\u7c97\u7c92\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bfc\u81f4\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7c97\u7c92\u5316\u5750\u6807\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u52bf\u80fd\u5e73\u5747\u529b\uff08PMF\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u529b\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u4ece\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60PMF\u3002", "result": "CG-BGs\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u663e\u5f0f\u6eb6\u5242\u4ecb\u5bfc\u7684\u590d\u6742\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u8868\u793a\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u504f\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u5206\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CG-BGs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7c97\u7c92\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5e73\u8861\u91c7\u6837\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

The proposed metrics assess how synthetic data reproduces key temporal characteristics, categorized into marginal, covariance, individual-level and measurement structures. We show that strong marginal-level resemblance may conceal distortions in covariance and disruptions in individual-level trajectories. Temporal preservation is influenced by factors such as original data quality, measurement frequency, and preprocessing strategies, including binning, variable encoding and precision. Variables with sparse or highly irregular measurement times provide limited information for learning temporal dependencies, resulting in reduced resemblance between the synthetic and original data. No single metric adequately captures temporal preservation; instead, a multidimensional evaluation across all characteristics provides a more comprehensive assessment of synthetic data quality. Overall, the proposed metrics clarify how and why temporal structures are preserved or degraded, enabling more reliable evaluation and improvement of generative models and supporting the creation of temporally realistic synthetic longitudinal patient data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u8bc4\u4f30\u5408\u6210\u7eb5\u5411\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u65f6\u95f4\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8861\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u60a3\u8005\u91cd\u590d\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6a21\u4eff\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6307\u6807\u6db5\u76d6\u8fb9\u9645\u3001\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u3001\u4e2a\u4f53\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\u7b49\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u8fb9\u9645\u7279\u5f81\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u63a9\u76d6\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u626d\u66f2\u3002\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6d4b\u91cf\u9891\u7387\u53ca\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u5206\u7bb1\u3001\u53d8\u91cf\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff09\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u65f6\u95f4\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff1b\u7a00\u758f\u6216\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u6d4b\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u96be\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u5355\u4e00\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u53cd\u6620\u65f6\u95f4\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u9700\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5982\u4f55\u88ab\u4fdd\u7559\u6216\u7834\u574f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u521b\u5efa\u66f4\u5177\u65f6\u95f4\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u5408\u6210\u7eb5\u5411\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5408\u6210\u7eb5\u5411\u6570\u636e\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u89c6\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u8fb9\u9645\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8bef\u5224\u3002\u771f\u5b9e\u7eb5\u5411\u6570\u636e\u5305\u542b\u590d\u6742\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u82e5\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u672a\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u518d\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5219\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u5957\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u3001\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u7c7b\u65f6\u95f4\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u8fb9\u9645\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u4e2a\u4f53\u6c34\u5e73\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u6d4b\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5728\u4e0a\u8ff0\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6d4b\u91cf\u9891\u7387\u548c\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5f3a\u8fb9\u9645\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u63a9\u76d6\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5931\u771f\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6d4b\u91cf\u9891\u7387\u4e0e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u65f6\u95f4\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff1b\u7a00\u758f\u6216\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u5bfc\u81f4\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b66\u4e60\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff1b\u5355\u4e00\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u95f4\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u7ef4\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65f6\u95f4\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u662f\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5408\u6210\u7eb5\u5411\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e94\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u4f53\u7cfb\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

However, progress in this area has been limited by the lack of large, diverse datasets necessary to address critical challenges such as generalization to new users and robustness to shifts in factors like footwear or walking speed. The recent release of the UNB StepUP-P150 dataset, the largest and most comprehensive collection of high-resolution footstep pressure recordings to date, opens new opportunities for addressing these challenges through deep learning. To mark this milestone, the First International StepUP Competition for Biometric Footstep Recognition was launched. Competitors were tasked with developing robust recognition models using the StepUP-P150 dataset that were then evaluated on a separate, dedicated test set designed to assess verification performance under challenging variations, given limited and relatively homogeneous reference data. The competition attracted global participation, with 23 registered teams from academia and industry. The top-performing team, Saeid_UCC, achieved the best equal error rate (EER) of 10.77% using a generative reward machine (GRM) optimization strategy. Overall, the competition showcased strong solutions, but persistent challenges in generalizing to unfamiliar footwear highlight a critical area for future work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u56fd\u9645\u6b65\u6001\u751f\u7269\u8bc6\u522b\u7ade\u8d5b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eUNB StepUP-P150\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u6b65\u6001\u538b\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u7ade\u8d5b\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u5728\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u540c\u8d28\u53c2\u8003\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e94\u5bf9\u978b\u5c65\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u6b65\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u9876\u7ea7\u56e2\u961fSaeid_UCC\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u53d6\u5f9710.77%\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u7b49\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff08EER\uff09\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u964c\u751f\u978b\u5c65\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u5b58\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6b65\u6001\u751f\u7269\u8bc6\u522b\u7814\u7a76\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u65b0\u7528\u6237\u6cdb\u5316\u53ca\u5bf9\u978b\u5c65\u3001\u6b65\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u7b49\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u7a81\u7834\u8fd9\u4e00\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528UNB StepUP-P150\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5f00\u5c55\u56fd\u9645\u7ade\u8d5b\uff0c\u53c2\u8d5b\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b65\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u53d8\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6848\u91c7\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5668\uff08GRM\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u56e2\u961f\u53d6\u5f9710.77%\u7684\u7b49\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff08EER\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u5907\u8f83\u5f3a\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u4f46\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u978b\u5c65\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "StepUP-P150\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u9996\u6b21\u56fd\u9645\u7ade\u8d5b\u6210\u529f\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u6b65\u6001\u751f\u7269\u8bc6\u522b\u9886\u57df\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5148\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd5\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u978b\u5c65\u7b49\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u662f\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u3002"}}

However, its performance degrades in high-dimensional problems with tightly coupled parameters and highly asymmetric objective landscapes, where rewards are sparse. In such needle-in-a-haystack scenarios, even advanced methods like trust-region BO (TurBO) often lead to unsatisfactory results. We propose a domain knowledge guided Bayesian Optimization approach, which leverages physical insight to fundamentally simplify the search problem by transforming coordinates to decouple input features and align the active subspaces with the primary search axes. We demonstrate this approach's efficacy on a challenging 12-dimensional, 6-crystal Split-and-Delay optical system, where conventional approaches, including standard BO, TuRBO and multi-objective BO, consistently led to unsatisfactory results. When combined with an reverse annealing exploration strategy, this approach reliably converges to the global optimum. The coordinate transformation itself is the key to this success, significantly accelerating the search by aligning input co-ordinate axes with the problem's active subspaces. As increasingly complex scientific instruments, from large telescopes to new spectrometers at X-ray Free Electron Lasers are deployed, the demand for robust high-dimensional optimization grows. Our results demonstrate a generalizable paradigm: leveraging physical insight to transform high-dimensional, coupled optimization problems into simpler representations can enable rapid and robust automated tuning for consistent high performance while still retaining current optimization algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u6d1e\u5bdf\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u5750\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u4f7f\u6d3b\u8dc3\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u4e3b\u8981\u641c\u7d22\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u7ef4\u3001\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u3002\u572812\u7ef4\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u3001TuRBO\u548c\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9006\u5411\u9000\u706b\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u7a33\u5b9a\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u5728\u4e8e\u5750\u6807\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u4f7f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u66f4\u6613\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u79d1\u5b66\u4eea\u5668\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8c03\u4f18\u63d0\u4f9b\u901a\u7528\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u3001\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u2018\u9488\u4e2d\u627e\u9488\u2019\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7a81\u7834\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u5750\u6807\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u65b0\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u6d3b\u8dc3\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u5750\u6807\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u8026\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u7b80\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u9006\u5411\u9000\u706b\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3a\u5168\u5c40\u641c\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u572812\u7ef4\u76846\u6676\u683c\u5206\u88c2-\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5149\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u3001TuRBO\u53ca\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u52a0\u901f\u641c\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8026\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u5750\u6807\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u666e\u9002\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65e5\u76ca\u590d\u6742\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u4eea\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Existing acceleration methods like distillation, trajectory truncation, and consistency approaches are static, require retraining, and often fail to generalize across tasks. We propose FastFlow, a plug-and-play adaptive inference framework that accelerates generation in flow matching models. FastFlow identifies denoising steps that produce only minor adjustments to the denoising path and approximates them without using the full neural network models used for velocity predictions. The approximation utilizes finite-difference velocity estimates from prior predictions to efficiently extrapolate future states, enabling faster advancements along the denoising path at zero compute cost. This enables skipping computation at intermediary steps. We model the decision of how many steps to safely skip before requiring a full model computation as a multi-armed bandit problem. The bandit learns the optimal skips to balance speed with performance. FastFlow integrates seamlessly with existing pipelines and generalizes across image generation, video generation, and editing tasks. Experiments demonstrate a speedup of over 2.6x while maintaining high-quality outputs.

In this paper, we propose CycFlow, a framework that replaces iterative edge denoising with deterministic point transport. CycFlow learns an instance-conditioned vector field that continuously transports input 2D coordinates to a canonical circular arrangement, where the optimal tour is recovered from this $2N$ dimensional representation via angular sorting. By leveraging data-dependent flow matching, we bypass the quadratic bottleneck of edge scoring in favor of linear coordinate dynamics. This paradigm shift accelerates solving speed by up to three orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art diffusion baselines, while maintaining competitive optimality gaps.", "AI": {"tldr": "CycFlow\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u70b9\u4f20\u8f93\u66ff\u4ee3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fb9\u53bb\u566a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u4f8b\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u5c062D\u5750\u6807\u8fde\u7eed\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6807\u51c6\u5706\u6392\u5217\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u5ea6\u6392\u5e8f\u6062\u590d\u6700\u4f18\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4ece\u4e8c\u6b21\u964d\u4f4e\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u89e3\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406TSP\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff08\u5982\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6c42\u89e3\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCycFlow\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u4f8b\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f93\u5165\u70b9\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8fd0\u8f93\u81f3\u6807\u51c6\u5706\u5f62\u6392\u5217\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e$2N$\u7ef4\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u89d2\u5ea6\u6392\u5e8f\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u8fed\u4ee3\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0cCycFlow\u5728\u6c42\u89e3\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CycFlow\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u70b9\u4f20\u8f93\u4e0e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u7ecf\u5178\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u9769\u65b0\uff0c\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

While existing methods successfully control body pose, they lack specific control over hair, and as a result, fail to capture the intricate hair motions, resulting in stiff and unrealistic animations. HairWeaver overcomes this limitation using two specialized modules: a Motion-Context-LoRA to integrate motion conditions and a Sim2Real-Domain-LoRA to preserve the subject's photoreal appearance across different data domains. These lightweight components are designed to guide a video diffusion backbone while maintaining its core generative capabilities. By training on a specialized dataset of dynamic human motion generated from a CG simulator, HairWeaver affords fine control over hair motion and ultimately learns to produce highly realistic hair that responds naturally to movement. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach sets a new state of the art, producing lifelike human hair animations with dynamic details.", "AI": {"tldr": "HairWeaver \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9\u5355\u4e2a\u4eba\u7c7b\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u753b\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u5b9e\u4e14\u5bcc\u6709\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u7684\u5934\u53d1\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u2014\u2014Motion-Context-LoRA \u548c Sim2Real-Domain-LoRA\u2014\u2014\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd0\u52a8\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u6574\u5408\u4e0e\u8de8\u57df\u5916\u89c2\u4fdd\u771f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6838\u5fc3\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u5934\u53d1\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u7136\u54cd\u5e94\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u903c\u771f\u53d1\u4e1d\u6548\u679c\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eceCG\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5934\u53d1\u52a8\u753b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u4e0e\u7ec6\u8282\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u8eab\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5934\u53d1\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u52a8\u753b\u4e2d\u5934\u53d1\u50f5\u786c\u3001\u4e0d\u81ea\u7136\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u7cbe\u51c6\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u5934\u53d1\u52a8\u6001\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa HairWeaver \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b Motion-Context-LoRA \u7528\u4e8e\u878d\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0cSim2Real-Domain-LoRA \u7528\u4e8e\u7ef4\u6301\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u57df\u4e0b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5916\u89c2\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e CG \u6a21\u62df\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5934\u53d1\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u903c\u771f\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u9879\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5934\u53d1\u52a8\u753b\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "HairWeaver \u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5934\u53d1\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u52a8\u753b\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u4eba\u7269\u52a8\u753b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Across both physical and general-purpose multimodal judge benchmarks, PhyCritic achieves strong performance gains over open-source baselines and, when applied as a policy model, further improves perception and reasoning in physically grounded tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "PhyCritic \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4efb\u52a1\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6279\u8bc4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff08RLVR\uff09\u6d41\u7a0b\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u6280\u80fd\u9884\u70ed\u9636\u6bb5\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6307\u5f0f\u6279\u8bc4\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc4\u5224\u751f\u6210\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u4ee5\u81ea\u8eab\u9884\u6d4b\u4e3a\u5185\u90e8\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u548c\u901a\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f00\u6e90\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u7269\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6279\u8bc4\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\uff09\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6d89\u53ca\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u7269\u7406AI\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u667a\u80fd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6279\u8bc4\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff08RLVR\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u6280\u80fd\u9884\u70ed\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4e3a\u81ea\u6307\u5f0f\u6279\u8bc4\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u8ba9\u6279\u8bc4\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u8eab\u9884\u6d4b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5185\u90e8\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u518d\u636e\u6b64\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5019\u9009\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "PhyCritic \u5728\u7269\u7406\u548c\u901a\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u5f53\u7528\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u7269\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "PhyCritic \u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e13\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u667a\u80fd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6279\u8bc4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7269\u7406\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Our approach integrates dynamic Gaussian surfels with a signed distance function formulation for geometric consistency, and leverages a video diffusion model to synthesize novel-view videos to refine reconstruction from sparse observations.

This limitation prevents them from effectively capturing global periodic patterns that often span cycles significantly longer than the input horizon - despite such patterns carrying strong predictive signals. Naive solutions, such as extending the historical window, lead to severe drawbacks, including overfitting, prohibitive computational costs, and redundant information processing. To address these challenges, we introduce the Global Temporal Retriever (GTR), a lightweight and plug-and-play module designed to extend any forecasting model's temporal awareness beyond the immediate historical context. GTR maintains an adaptive global temporal embedding of the entire cycle and dynamically retrieves and aligns relevant global segments with the input sequence. By jointly modeling local and global dependencies through a 2D convolution and residual fusion, GTR effectively bridges short-term observations with long-term periodicity without altering the host model architecture. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance across both short-term and long-term forecasting scenarios, while incurring minimal parameter and computational overhead. These results highlight GTR as an efficient and general solution for enhancing global periodicity modeling in MTSF tasks.

For instance, in hyperparameter tuning, the validation accuracy of a model configuration (arm) typically increases with each training epoch. A defining characteristic of RMAB is em horizon-dependent optimality: unlike standard settings, the optimal strategy here shifts dramatically depending on the available budget $T$. This implies that knowledge of $T$ yields significantly greater utility in RMAB, empowering the learner to align its decision-making with this shifting optimality. However, the horizon-aware setting remains underexplored. To address this, we propose a novel CUmulative Reward Estimation UCB (CURE-UCB) that explicitly integrates the horizon. We provide a rigorous analysis establishing a new regret upper bound and prove that our method strictly outperforms horizon-agnostic strategies in structured environments like ``linear-then-flat'' instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate its significant superiority over baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684CURE-UCB\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0a\u5347\u591a\u81c2\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\uff08RMAB\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u5c06\u9884\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4T\u7eb3\u5165\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65e0\u89c6\u91ce\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u540e\u6094\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u5982\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u4e2d\uff0c\u9009\u9879\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u968f\u4f7f\u7528\u6b21\u6570\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8fd9\u9700\u8981\u6a21\u578b\u8003\u8651\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u5ffd\u7565\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u7b97\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u7b97\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCURE-UCB\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7d2f\u79ef\u5956\u52b1\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u4e0a\u754c\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u7b97T\uff0c\u4f7f\u51b3\u7b56\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\uff08\u5982\u7ebf\u6027\u540e\u5e73\u5766\u578b\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff09\u4e0b\u4e25\u683c\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u89c6\u91ce\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "CURE-UCB\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u7b97\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u4e0a\u5347\u591a\u81c2\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Whether these capabilities translate to mission-critical applications such as electricity demand forecasting--where accuracy, calibration, and robustness directly affect grid operations--remains an open question. We present a multi-dimensional benchmark evaluating four TSFMs (Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-2, Moirai-2, and TinyTimeMixer) alongside Prophet as an industry-standard baseline and two statistical references (SARIMA and Seasonal Naive), using ERCOT hourly load data from 2020 to 2024. All experiments run on consumer-grade hardware (AMD Ryzen 7, 16GB RAM, no GPU). The evaluation spans four axes: (1) context length sensitivity from 24 to 2048 hours, (2) probabilistic forecast calibration, (3) robustness under distribution shifts including COVID-19 lockdowns and Winter Storm Uri, and (4) prescriptive analytics for operational decision support. The top-performing foundation models achieve MASE values near 0.31 at long context lengths (C = 2048h, day-ahead horizon), a 47% reduction over the Seasonal Naive baseline. The inclusion of Prophet exposes a structural advantage of pre-trained models: Prophet fails when the fitting window is shorter than its seasonality period (MASE > 74 at 24-hour context), while TSFMs maintain stable accuracy even with minimal context because they recognise temporal patterns learned during pre-training rather than estimating them from scratch. Calibration varies substantially across models--Chronos-2 produces well-calibrated prediction intervals (95% empirical coverage at 90% nominal level) while both Moirai-2 and Prophet exhibit overconfidence (~70% coverage).

Yet, existing benchmarks predominantly assess $\\textit{Crystallized Intelligence}$, which relies on recalling accumulated knowledge and learned schemas. This focus overlooks $\\textit{Generative Fluid Intelligence (GFI)}$: the capacity to induce patterns, reason through constraints, and adapt to novel scenarios on the fly. To rigorously assess this capability, we introduce $\\textbf{GENIUS}$ ($\\textbf{GEN}$ Fluid $\\textbf{I}$ntelligence Eval$\\textbf{U}$ation $\\textbf{S}$uite). We formalize $\\textit{GFI}$ as a synthesis of three primitives. These include $\\textit{Inducing Implicit Patterns}$ (e.g., inferring personalized visual preferences), $\\textit{Executing Ad-hoc Constraints}$ (e.g., visualizing abstract metaphors), and $\\textit{Adapting to Contextual Knowledge}$ (e.g., simulating counter-intuitive physics). Collectively, these primitives challenge models to solve problems grounded entirely in the immediate context. Our systematic evaluation of 12 representative models reveals significant performance deficits in these tasks. Crucially, our diagnostic analysis disentangles these failure modes. It demonstrates that deficits stem from limited context comprehension rather than insufficient intrinsic generative capability.

In practical FL systems, privacy constraints prohibit centralizing raw data, while communication efficiency introduces further challenges for distributed preprocessing. We introduce FedPS, a unified framework for federated data preprocessing based on aggregated statistics.

We secret-share the watermark key $\u03c4$ so that coalitions of fewer than $t$ clients cannot reconstruct it, and verification can be performed without revealing $\u03c4$ in the clear. We instantiate our protocol in the white-box setting and evaluate on image classification.

To validate the efficiency of the proposed method, we conducted comprehensive experiments on five board games: Animal Shogi, Gardner Chess, Go, Hex, and Othello. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more efficient learning than existing methods across these environments.

Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) offers a straightforward way to inject domain knowledge but often degrades the model's generality. In contrast, on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) preserves generality but fails to effectively assimilate hard samples that exceed the model's current reasoning level. Recent off-policy RL attempts improve hard sample utilization, yet they suffer from severe training instability due to the forced distribution shift toward off-policy knowledge. To reconcile effective off-policy knowledge absorption with the stability of on-policy RL, we propose Rephrasing Policy Optimization (RePO). In RePO, the policy model is prompted to first comprehend off-policy knowledge and then rephrase it into trajectories that conform to its own stylistic and parametric distribution. RePO dynamically replaces low-reward rollouts with these rephrased, high-quality trajectories. This strategy guides the model toward correct reasoning paths while strictly preserving on-policy training dynamics. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that RePO improves hard-sample utilization and outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "RePO\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u7406\u89e3\u79bb\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u518d\u5c06\u5176\u91cd\u8ff0\u4e3a\u7b26\u5408\u81ea\u8eab\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u5438\u6536\u96be\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u8d85\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u63a8\u7406\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u96be\u6837\u672c\uff1b\u867d\u7136\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u96be\u6837\u672c\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "RePO\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u7406\u89e3\u79bb\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u518d\u5c06\u5176\u91cd\u8ff0\u4e3a\u7b26\u5408\u81ea\u8eab\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u66ff\u6362\u4f4e\u5956\u52b1\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u5e76\u5f15\u5bfc\u6b63\u786e\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\uff0cRePO\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u96be\u6837\u672c\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "RePO\u6210\u529f\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebf\u77e5\u8bc6\u5438\u6536\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Lampert"], "title": "Adaptive Sampling for Private Worst-Case Group Optimization", "comment": "8 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "Models trained by minimizing the average loss often fail to be accurate on small or hard-to-learn groups of the data. Various methods address this issue by optimizing a weighted objective that focuses on the worst-performing groups. However, this approach becomes problematic when learning with differential privacy, as unequal data weighting can result in inhomogeneous privacy guarantees, in particular weaker privacy for minority groups. In this work, we introduce a new algorithm for differentially private worst-case group optimization called ASC (Adaptively Sampled and Clipped Worst-case Group Optimization). It adaptively controls both the sampling rate and the clipping threshold of each group. Thereby, it allows for harder-to-learn groups to be sampled more often while ensuring consistent privacy guarantees across all groups. Comparing ASC to prior work, we show that it results in lower-variance gradients, tighter privacy guarantees, and substantially higher worst-case group accuracy without sacrificing overall average accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faASC\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u7fa4\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u548c\u88c1\u526a\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u56f0\u96be\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5404\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f4e\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u3001\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u754c\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u7fa4\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6574\u4f53\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e0b\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u52a0\u6743\u4e0d\u5747\u5bfc\u81f4\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u969c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u5c11\u6570\u7fa4\u4f53\u4fdd\u62a4\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u517c\u987e\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faASC\uff08Adaptively Sampled and Clipped Worst-case Group Optimization\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u548c\u88c1\u526a\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u4f7f\u96be\u5b66\u4e60\u7fa4\u4f53\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u591a\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u6240\u6709\u7fa4\u4f53\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u969c\u3002", "result": "ASC\u76f8\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u3001\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6574\u4f53\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "ASC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e0b\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u7fa4\u4f53\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u969c\u516c\u5e73\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u6216\u5c0f\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In many real-world domains, online learning in the environment can be risky, and specifying accurate safety costs can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories that reflect undesirable or unsafe behavior, implicitly conveying what the agent should avoid. We refer to these as non-preferred trajectories. We propose a novel offline safe IL algorithm, OSIL, that infers safety from non-preferred demonstrations. We formulate safe policy learning as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). Instead of relying on explicit safety cost and reward annotations, OSIL reformulates the CMDP problem by deriving a lower bound on reward maximizing objective and learning a cost model that estimates the likelihood of non-preferred behavior. Our approach allows agents to learn safe and reward-maximizing behavior entirely from offline demonstrations. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn safer policies that satisfy cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thus outperforming several baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5OSIL\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u4f18\u9009\u8f68\u8ff9\u63a8\u65ad\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08CMDP\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5956\u52b1\u6700\u5927\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u975e\u4f18\u9009\u884c\u4e3a\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ec5\u4ece\u79bb\u7ebf\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5b89\u5168\u4e14\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u5b58\u5728\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u6307\u5b9a\u5b89\u5168\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u4f46\u6536\u96c6\u53cd\u6620\u4e0d\u671f\u671b\u6216\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f68\u8ff9\u9690\u542b\u4e86\u5e94\u907f\u514d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08CMDP\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u4f18\u9009\u8f68\u8ff9\u63a8\u65ad\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5956\u52b1\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f30\u8ba1\u975e\u4f18\u9009\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7684\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u6210\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u5956\u52b1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "OSIL\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u5b89\u5168\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u79bb\u7ebf\u6f14\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u51fa\u65e2\u5b89\u5168\u53c8\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

By computing activation-difference vectors for both test prompts and preference pairs and ranking by cosine similarity, we identify datapoints that cause specific behaviors and validate these attributions causally by retraining with modified data. Clustering behavior-datapoint similarity matrices also enables unsupervised discovery of emergent behaviors. Applying this to OLMo 2's production DPO training, we surfaced distractor-triggered compliance: a harmful behavior where the model complies with dangerous requests when benign formatting instructions are appended.

Existing primal-dual methods that achieve sublinear strong reward regret inevitably incur growing strong constraint violation or are restricted to average-iterate convergence due to inherent oscillations. To address these limitations, we propose the Flexible safety Domain Optimization via Margin-regularized Exploration (FlexDOME) algorithm, the first to provably achieve near-constant $\\tilde{O}(1)$ strong constraint violation alongside sublinear strong regret and non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence. FlexDOME incorporates time-varying safety margins and regularization terms into the primal-dual framework. Our theoretical analysis relies on a novel term-wise asymptotic dominance strategy, where the safety margin is rigorously scheduled to asymptotically majorize the functional decay rates of the optimization and statistical errors, thereby clamping cumulative violations to a near-constant level. Furthermore, we establish non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence guarantees via a policy-dual Lyapunov argument.

Roberts"], "title": "General Flexible $f$-divergence for Challenging Offline RL Datasets with Low Stochasticity and Diverse Behavior Policies", "comment": "Extended version of the full paper with the appendix accepted at AAMAS 2026", "summary": "Offline RL algorithms aim to improve upon the behavior policy that produces the collected data while constraining the learned policy to be within the support of the dataset. However, practical offline datasets often contain examples with little diversity or limited exploration of the environment, and from multiple behavior policies with diverse expertise levels. Limited exploration can impair the offline RL algorithm's ability to estimate \\textit{Q} or \\textit{V} values, while constraining towards diverse behavior policies can be overly conservative. Such datasets call for a balance between the RL objective and behavior policy constraints. We first identify the connection between $f$-divergence and optimization constraint on the Bellman residual through a more general Linear Programming form for RL and the convex conjugate. Following this, we introduce the general flexible function formulation for the $f$-divergence to incorporate an adaptive constraint on algorithms' learning objectives based on the offline training dataset. Results from experiments on the MuJoCo, Fetch, and AdroitHand environments show the correctness of the proposed LP form and the potential of the flexible $f$-divergence in improving performance for learning from a challenging dataset when applied to a compatible constrained optimization algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8ef-\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5e73\u8861\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u51f8\u5171\u8f6d\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u4e0e\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u6b8b\u5dee\u4f18\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728MuJoCo\u3001Fetch\u548cAdroitHand\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u9645\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e38\u5305\u542b\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\u6216\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6c34\u5e73\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u7b97\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1Q\u6216V\u503c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u4f1a\u9650\u5236\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u7ea6\u675f\u4e4b\u95f4\u627e\u5230\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u5f62\u5f0f\u548c\u51f8\u5171\u8f6d\uff0c\u5efa\u7acbf-\u6563\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u6b8b\u5dee\u4f18\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u6027\u7684\u67d4\u6027f-\u6563\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u5f62\u5f0f\u6b63\u786e\uff0c\u67d4\u6027f-\u6563\u5ea6\u5728\u590d\u6742\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4e0e\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u7ea6\u675f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u591a\u6e90\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, controlling the composition of multiple pre-trained models remains an open challenge. Current approaches largely treat composition as an algebraic composition of probability densities, such as via products or mixtures of experts.

In this work, we propose a different paradigm that formulates compositional generation as a cooperative Stochastic Optimal Control problem. Rather than combining probability densities, we treat pre-trained diffusion models as interacting agents whose diffusion trajectories are jointly steered, via optimal control, toward a shared objective defined on their aggregated output.

Existing KE methods are largely designed for dense architectures, limiting their applicability to the increasingly prevalent sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models that underpin modern scalable LLMs. Although MoEs offer strong efficiency and capacity scaling, naively adapting dense-model editors is both computationally costly and prone to routing distribution shifts that undermine stability and consistency. To address these challenges, we introduce MoEEdit, the first routing-stable framework for parameter-modifying knowledge editing in MoE LLMs. Our method reparameterizes expert updates via per-expert null-space projections that keep router inputs invariant and thereby suppress routing shifts. The resulting block-structured optimization is solved efficiently with a block coordinate descent (BCD) solver. Experiments show that MoEEdit attains state-of-the-art efficacy and generalization while preserving high specificity and routing stability, with superior compute and memory efficiency.

Cheung"], "title": "MoToRec: Sparse-Regularized Multimodal Tokenization for Cold-Start Recommendation", "comment": "Accepted to AAAI 2026 (Main Track)", "summary": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have revolutionized recommender systems by effectively modeling complex user-item interactions, yet data sparsity and the item cold-start problem significantly impair performance, particularly for new items with limited or no interaction history. While multimodal content offers a promising solution, existing methods result in suboptimal representations for new items due to noise and entanglement in sparse data. To address this, we transform multimodal recommendation into discrete semantic tokenization. We present Sparse-Regularized Multimodal Tokenization for Cold-Start Recommendation (MoToRec), a framework centered on a sparsely-regularized Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) that generates a compositional semantic code of discrete, interpretable tokens, promoting disentangled representations. MoToRec's architecture is enhanced by three synergistic components: (1) a sparsely-regularized RQ-VAE that promotes disentangled representations, (2) a novel adaptive rarity amplification that promotes prioritized learning for cold-start items, and (3) a hierarchical multi-source graph encoder for robust signal fusion with collaborative signals. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate MoToRec's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both overall and cold-start scenarios. Our work validates that discrete tokenization provides an effective and scalable alternative for mitigating the long-standing cold-start challenge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMoToRec\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u91cf\u5316\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u8bed\u4e49\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u89e3\u8026\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7a00\u6709\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u591a\u6e90\u56fe\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u65b0\u7269\u54c1\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u65b0\u7269\u54c1\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\u63d0\u4f9b\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u7ea0\u7f20\u5bfc\u81f4\u65b0\u7269\u54c1\u8868\u793a\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u65b0\u7269\u54c1\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u91cf\u5316\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08RQ-VAE\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u79bb\u6563\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7a00\u6709\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u4f18\u5148\u5b66\u4e60\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u7269\u54c1\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u591a\u6e90\u56fe\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u878d\u5408\u534f\u540c\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMoToRec\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u79bb\u6563\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u957f\u671f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We study this problem in full-body human motion, where large-scale data collection is infeasible but essential for wearable-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR), and where synthetic motion can be generated from motion-capture-derived representations. We pretrain motion time-series models using such synthetic data and evaluate their transfer across diverse downstream HAR tasks. Our results show that synthetic pretraining improves generalisation when mixed with real data or scaled sufficiently.

Existing methods are either too expensive for deployment at scale, or require initial white-box access to model weights or grey-box access to log probabilities. We aim to achieve both low cost and strict black-box operation, observing only output tokens.\n  Our approach hinges on specific inputs we call Border Inputs, for which there exists more than one output top token. From a statistical perspective, optimal change detection depends on the model's Jacobian and the Fisher information of the output distribution. Analyzing these quantities in low-temperature regimes shows that border inputs enable powerful change detection tests.\n  Building on this insight, we propose the Black-Box Border Input Tracking (B3IT) scheme. Extensive in-vivo and in-vitro experiments show that border inputs are easily found for non-reasoning tested endpoints, and achieve performance on par with the best available grey-box approaches.

We introduce MerLin, an open source framework designed as a discovery engine for photonic and hybrid quantum machine learning. MerLin integrates optimized strong simulation of linear optical circuits into standard PyTorch and scikit learn workflows, enabling end to end differentiable training of quantum layers. MerLin is designed around systematic benchmarking and reproducibility. As an initial contribution, we reproduce eighteen state of the art photonic and hybrid QML works spanning kernel methods, reservoir computing, convolutional and recurrent architectures, generative models, and modern training paradigms.

Recent generative approaches, including diffusion models, show strong performance under hypervolume, yet their behavior under other established MOO metrics is less understood. We show that generative methods systematically underperform evolutionary alternatives with respect to other metrics, such as generational distance. We relate this failure mode to the offline-frontier shift, i.e., the displacement of the offline dataset from the Pareto front, which acts as a fundamental limitation in offline MOO. We argue that overcoming this limitation requires out-of-distribution sampling in objective space (via an integral probability metric) and empirically observe that generative methods remain conservatively close to the offline objective distribution. Our results position offline MOO as a distribution-shift--limited problem and provide a diagnostic lens for understanding when and why generative optimization methods fail.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebf\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\uff08MOO\uff09\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u8d85\u4f53\u79ef\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u5982\u751f\u6210\u8ddd\u79bb\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u900a\u4e8e\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u6e90\u4e8e\u201c\u79bb\u7ebf\u524d\u6cbf\u504f\u79fb\u201d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u70b9\u504f\u79bb\u771f\u5b9e\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u6784\u6210\u79bb\u7ebfMOO\u7684\u6839\u672c\u9650\u5236\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u91c7\u6837\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u79ef\u5206\u6982\u7387\u5ea6\u91cf\uff09\u6765\u514b\u670d\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5b88\u5730\u505c\u7559\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u79bb\u7ebfMOO\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u867d\u5728\u8d85\u4f53\u79ef\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u5173\u952e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u751f\u6210\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u539f\u56e0\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u5c40\u9650\u7684\u6839\u672c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u6307\u6807\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u2018\u79bb\u7ebf\u524d\u6cbf\u504f\u79fb\u2019\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u79ef\u5206\u6982\u7387\u5ea6\u91cf\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u91c7\u6837\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u8fdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8ddd\u79bb\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u52a3\u4e8e\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u91c7\u6837\uff1b\u79bb\u7ebf\u524d\u6cbf\u504f\u79fb\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u9650\u5236\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u76ee\u6807\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u8981\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u91c7\u6837\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Policy optimization algorithms generate a number of responses for a given prompt and then effectively weight the corresponding gradients depending on the rewards. The most popular algorithms including GRPO, DAPO, and RLOO focus on ambiguous prompts, i.e., prompts with intermediate success probability, while downgrading gradients with very easy and very hard prompts. In this paper, we consider asymmetric prompt weightings that assign higher weights to prompts with low, or even zero, empirical success probability. We find that asymmetric weighting particularly benefits from-scratch RL (as in R1-Zero), where training traverses a wide accuracy range, and less so in post-SFT RL where the model already starts at high accuracy. We also provide theory that characterizes prompt weights which minimize the time needed to raise success probability from an initial level to a target accuracy under a fixed update budget. In low-success regimes, where informative responses are rare and response cost dominates, these optimal weights become asymmetric, upweighting low success probabilities and thereby accelerating effective-time convergence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982GRPO\u3001DAPO\u548cRLOO\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6a21\u7cca\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e2d\u7b49\uff09\u7ed9\u4e88\u8f83\u9ad8\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u7b80\u5355\u6216\u56f0\u96be\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6743\u91cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bf9\u4f4e\u6210\u529f\u7387\u751a\u81f3\u96f6\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8d4b\u4e88\u66f4\u9ad8\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5728\u4ece\u96f6\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u5982R1-Zero\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u5f31\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6210\u529f\u7387\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u91cd\u5e94\u504f\u5411\u4f4e\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u6709\u6548\u65f6\u95f4\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5f53\u54cd\u5e94\u6210\u672c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u65f6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4f4e\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u793a\u65f6\u6743\u91cd\u8fc7\u4f4e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7a00\u758f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4ece\u96f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u521d\u59cb\u6027\u80fd\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u793a\u6743\u91cd\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u54cd\u5e94\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u6210\u529f\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u63d0\u793a\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u5206\u6790\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u66f4\u65b0\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6240\u9700\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728R1-Zero\u7b49\u4ece\u96f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u540eSFT RL\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6743\u91cd\u5728\u4f4e\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9636\u6bb5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4ece\u96f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5728\u4f4e\u6210\u529f\u7387\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u91cd\u5e94\u504f\u5411\u4f4e\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u52a0\u901f\u6709\u6548\u65f6\u95f4\u6536\u655b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u4f4e\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8bad\u7ec3\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6743\u91cd\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4f4e\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u96f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u54cd\u5e94\u6210\u672c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

We introduce TabICLv2, a new state-of-the-art foundation model for regression and classification built on three pillars: (1) a novel synthetic data generation engine designed for high pretraining diversity; (2) various architectural innovations, including a new scalable softmax in attention improving generalization to larger datasets without prohibitive long-sequence pretraining; and (3) optimized pretraining protocols, notably replacing AdamW with the Muon optimizer. On the TabArena and TALENT benchmarks, TabICLv2 without any tuning surpasses the performance of the current state of the art, RealTabPFN-2.5 (hyperparameter-tuned, ensembled, and fine-tuned on real data). With only moderate pretraining compute, TabICLv2 generalizes effectively to million-scale datasets under 50GB GPU memory while being markedly faster than RealTabPFN-2.5. We provide extensive ablation studies to quantify these contributions and commit to open research by first releasing inference code and model weights at https://github.com/soda-inria/tabicl, with synthetic data engine and pretraining code to follow.", "AI": {"tldr": "TabICLv2 \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7528\u4e8e\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u8868\u683c\u5f0f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u7a81\u7834\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u65b0\u578b\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684softmax\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u7528 Muon \u4f18\u5316\u5668\u66ff\u4ee3 AdamW\u3002\u5728 TabArena \u548c TALENT \u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u672a\u7ecf\u8c03\u4f18\u7684 TabICLv2 \u5df2\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6a21\u578b RealTabPFN-2.5\uff08\u9700\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u3001\u96c6\u6210\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u3002\u4ec5\u9700\u9002\u5ea6\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u5728 50GB GPU \u5185\u5b58\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u767e\u4e07\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e14\u901f\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5feb\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8be6\u5c3d\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u627f\u8bfa\u5f00\u6e90\u63a8\u7406\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u540e\u7eed\u5c06\u5f00\u653e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5f15\u64ce\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8868\u683c\u5f0f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5df2\u8d85\u8d8a\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6811\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8868\u683c\u5f0f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa TabICLv2\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u9879\u6838\u5fc3\u6280\u672f\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684 softmax \u673a\u5236\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u91c7\u7528 Muon \u4f18\u5316\u5668\u66ff\u4ee3 AdamW\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "TabICLv2 \u5728\u672a\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4efb\u4f55\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728 TabArena \u4e0e TALENT \u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a RealTabPFN-2.5\uff08\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u591a\u8f6e\u8c03\u4f18\u3001\u96c6\u6210\u53ca\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u7b49\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u5728 50GB GPU \u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u5904\u7406\u767e\u4e07\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u5feb\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "TabICLv2 \u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u8868\u683c\u5f0f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u91cc\u7a0b\u7891\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u4f18\u52bf\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u9769\u65b0\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u52a8\u8868\u683c\u5f0f AI \u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u627f\u8bfa\u63a8\u8fdb\u5f00\u653e\u79d1\u5b66\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u516c\u5f00\u5168\u90e8\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u52a9\u529b\u793e\u533a\u6301\u7eed\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002"}}

Doing it on edge hardware improves privacy and lowers latency, but entails memory constraints. To address this, we propose Error-enhanced Contrastive Handwriting Recognition (ECHWR), a training framework designed to improve feature representation and recognition accuracy without increasing inference costs. ECHWR utilizes a temporary auxiliary branch that aligns sensor signals with semantic text embeddings during the training phase. This alignment is maintained through a dual contrastive objective: an in-batch contrastive loss for general modality alignment and a novel error-based contrastive loss that distinguishes between correct signals and synthetic hard negatives. The auxiliary branch is discarded after training, which allows the deployed model to keep its original, efficient architecture. Evaluations on the OnHW-Words500 dataset show that ECHWR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing character error rates by up to 7.4% on the writer-independent split and 10.4% on the writer-dependent split. Finally, although our ablation studies indicate that solving specific challenges require specific architectural and objective configurations, error-based contrastive loss shows its effectiveness for handling unseen writing styles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aECHWR\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e34\u65f6\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u652f\u548c\u53cc\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u6279\u5185\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u624b\u5199\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u624b\u5199\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728OnHW-Words500\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u4e66\u5199\u98ce\u683c\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u624b\u5199\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u5185\u5b58\u7ea6\u675f\u5e76\u4fdd\u62a4\u7528\u6237\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u800c\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u90e8\u7f72\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e34\u65f6\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5c06\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6279\u5185\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u6b63\u786e\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u96be\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b8c\u6210\u540e\u4e22\u5f03\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728OnHW-Words500\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b57\u7b26\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u6700\u591a\u8fbe7.4%\uff08\u5199\u4f5c\u8005\u65e0\u5173\uff09\u548c10.4%\uff08\u5199\u4f5c\u8005\u76f8\u5173\uff09\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u5bf9\u5904\u7406\u672a\u89c1\u4e66\u5199\u98ce\u683c\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ECHWR\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u60ef\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u5355\u5143\u7684\u624b\u5199\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b0\u4e66\u5199\u98ce\u683c\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u6539\u53d8\u90e8\u7f72\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}
