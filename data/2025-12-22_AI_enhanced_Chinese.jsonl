Within this broader landscape, Entity Set Expansion is one prominent task aimed at taking an initial set of (tuples of) entities and identifying additional ones that share relevant semantic properties with the former -- potentially repeating the process to form increasingly broader sets. However, this ``linear'' approach does not unveil the richer ``taxonomic'' structures present in knowledge resources. A recent logic-based framework introduces the notion of an expansion graph: a rooted directed acyclic graph where each node represents a semantic generalization labeled by a logical formula, and edges encode strict semantic inclusion. This structure supports taxonomic expansions of entity sets driven by knowledge bases. Yet, the potentially large size of such graphs may make full materialization impractical in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, we formalize reasoning tasks that check whether two tuples belong to comparable, incomparable, or the same nodes in the graph. Our results show that, under realistic assumptions -- such as bounding the input or limiting entity descriptions -- these tasks can be implemented efficiently. This enables local, incremental navigation of expansion graphs, supporting practical applications without requiring full graph construction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u4f53\u96c6\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\uff08\u7a0e\u6cd5\u5f0f\uff09\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u96be\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u53ef\u5224\u65ad\u4e24\u4e2a\u5143\u7ec4\u5728\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff08\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u6216\u76f8\u540c\u8282\u70b9\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c40\u90e8\u3001\u589e\u91cf\u5f0f\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5b8c\u6574\u6784\u9020\u6574\u4e2a\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b9e\u4f53\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u77e5\u8bc6\u8d44\u6e90\u4e2d\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u4e3a\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u652f\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u8868\u8fbe\u590d\u6742\u5c42\u7ea7\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u56e0\u89c4\u6a21\u8fc7\u5927\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\uff08expansion graph\uff09\u8fd9\u4e00\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8282\u70b9\u7531\u903b\u8f91\u516c\u5f0f\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u8868\u793a\u8bed\u4e49\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u8fb9\u8868\u793a\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5305\u542b\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5728\u5408\u7406\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u9650\u5236\u8f93\u5165\u5927\u5c0f\u6216\u5b9e\u4f53\u63cf\u8ff0\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff09\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u56fe\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u3001\u589e\u91cf\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u7406\u5047\u8bbe\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u65e0\u9700\u5168\u91cf\u6784\u5efa\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u5373\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5c40\u90e8\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

However, the super-linear cost of its orthonormalization step introduces increasing overhead with scale. To alleviate this cost, several works have attempted to reduce the size of the matrix entering the orthonormalization step. We introduce Dion2, a much simpler method for shrinking the matrix involved in Muon's computation compared to prior approaches. At a high level, Dion2 selects a fraction of rows or columns at each iteration and orthonormalizes only those.

However, real-world queries are often relational, seeking to understand how entities are associated. In this work, we introduce relation-centric KGQA, a complementary setting where the answer is a subgraph capturing the semantic connections among entities rather than an individual entity. The main challenge lies in the abundance of candidate subgraphs, where trivial or overly common connections often obscure the identification of unique and informative answers. To tackle this, we propose UniRel-R1, a unified framework that integrates subgraph selection, multi-stage graph pruning, and an LLM fine-tuned with reinforcement learning.

This project presents a low-cost, dual-mode neuro-muscular control system integrating electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) to enable real-time, multi-degree-of-freedom control of a prosthetic arm. EEG signals are acquired using the NeuroSky MindWave Mobile 2 and transmitted via ThinkGear Bluetooth packets to an ESP32 microcontroller running a lightweight classification model. The model was trained on 1500 seconds of recorded EEG data using a 6-frame sliding window with low-pass filtering, excluding poor-signal samples and using a 70/20/10 training--validation--test split. The classifier detects strong blink events, which toggle the hand between open and closed states. EMG signals are acquired using a MyoWare 2.0 sensor and SparkFun wireless shield and transmitted to a second ESP32, which performs threshold-based detection. Three activation bands (rest: 0--T1; extension: T1--T2; contraction: greater than T2) enable intuitive elbow control, with movement triggered only after eight consecutive frames in a movement class to improve stability. The EEG-controlled ESP32 actuates four finger servos, while the EMG-controlled ESP32 drives two elbow servos. A functional prototype was constructed using low-cost materials (total cost approximately 240 dollars), with most expense attributed to the commercial EEG headset. Future work includes transitioning to a 3D-printed chassis, integrating auto-regressive models to reduce EMG latency, and upgrading servo torque for improved load capacity and grip strength. This system demonstrates a feasible pathway to low-cost, biologically intuitive prosthetic control suitable for underserved and global health applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u53cc\u6a21\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u808c\u8089\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8111\u7535\u56fe\uff08EEG\uff09\u548c\u808c\u7535\u56fe\uff08EMG\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5047\u80a2\u624b\u81c2\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u591a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f7f\u7528NeuroSky MindWave Mobile 2\u91c7\u96c6EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u84dd\u7259\u4f20\u8f93\u81f3ESP32\u5fae\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f3a\u7728\u773c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6765\u5207\u6362\u624b\u90e8\u5f00\u5408\u72b6\u6001\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528MyoWare 2.0\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u91c7\u96c6EMG\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7ecf\u9608\u503c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8098\u90e8\u7684\u76f4\u89c2\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u516b\u5e27\u5224\u5b9a\u63d0\u5347\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u4e24\u4e2aESP32\u5206\u522b\u63a7\u5236\u624b\u6307\u548c\u8098\u90e8\u4f3a\u670d\u7535\u673a\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u6210\u672c\u7ea6240\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u652f\u51fa\u4e3a\u5546\u4e1a\u7ea7EEG\u5934\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u3002\u672a\u6765\u5c06\u4f18\u5316\u4e3a3D\u6253\u5370\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4f3a\u670d\u626d\u77e9\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6293\u63e1\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5047\u80a2\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u80a2\u5047\u80a2\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u622a\u80a2\u8005\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u6a21\u4fe1\u53f7\u878d\u5408\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eEEG\u7684\u7728\u773c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc76\u5e27\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u4e0e\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5904\u74061500\u79d2\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u752870/20/10\u5212\u5206\u8bad\u7ec3-\u9a8c\u8bc1-\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\uff0c\u7531\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u5f3a\u7728\u773c\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u624b\u90e8\u5f00\u95ed\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eEMG\u7684\u9608\u503c\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e09\u4e2a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u533a\u95f4\uff08\u9759\u6b62\u3001\u4f38\u5c55\u3001\u6536\u7f29\uff09\uff0c\u4ec5\u5f53\u8fde\u7eed8\u5e27\u5904\u4e8e\u540c\u4e00\u8fd0\u52a8\u7c7b\u65f6\u89e6\u53d1\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u6240\u6709\u4fe1\u53f7\u901a\u8fc7ESP32\u5904\u7406\u5e76\u5206\u522b\u9a71\u52a8\u4f3a\u670d\u7535\u673a\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u529f\u80fd\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u603b\u6210\u672c\u7ea6\u4e3a240\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5047\u80a2\u624b\u81c2\u7684\u624b\u6307\u4e0e\u8098\u90e8\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u76f4\u89c2\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u53cc\u6a21\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u808c\u8089\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u751f\u7269\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u5047\u80a2\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u5207\u5b9e\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u532e\u4e4f\u5730\u533a\u548c\u5168\u7403\u5065\u5eb7\u9886\u57df\u63a8\u5e7f\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This study aims to develop a system capable of identifying websites suspected of containing pornographic image content, using a deep learning approach with convolutional neural network (CNN) and visual geometry group 16 (VGG-16) model. The two models were then explored comprehensively and holistically to determine which model was most effective in detecting pornographic content quickly. Based on the findings of the comparison between testing the CNN and VGG-16 models, research results showed that the best test results were obtained in the eighth experiment using the CNN model at an epoch value level of 50 and a learning rate of 0.001 of 0.9487 or 94.87%.

Current solutions force enterprises to choose between expensive, proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) and low-performing Small Language Models (SLMs). Efforts to improve SLMs often rely on distilling reasoning from large LLMs using unstructured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, a process that remains inherently ambiguous. Instead, we hypothesize that a formal, structured reasoning representation provides a clearer, more reliable teaching signal, as the Text-to-SQL task requires explicit and precise logical steps. To evaluate this hypothesis, we propose Struct-SQL, a novel Knowledge Distillation (KD) framework that trains an SLM to emulate a powerful large LLM. Consequently, we adopt a query execution plan as a formal blueprint to derive this structured reasoning. Our SLM, distilled with structured CoT, achieves an absolute improvement of 8.1% over an unstructured CoT distillation baseline. A detailed error analysis reveals that a key factor in this gain is a marked reduction in syntactic errors. This demonstrates that teaching a model to reason using a structured logical blueprint is beneficial for reliable SQL generation in SLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa Struct-SQL\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u67e5\u8be2\u6267\u884c\u8ba1\u5212\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u5f0f\u903b\u8f91\u84dd\u56fe\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLM\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6587\u672c\u8f6cSQL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b08.1%\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8bed\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u5bf9SLM\u53ef\u9760\u751f\u6210SQL\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u6587\u672c\u8f6cSQL\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u6210\u672c\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e09\u96be\u56f0\u5883\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4e13\u6709\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u6027\u80fd\u8f83\u5dee\u7684\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6e05\u6670\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Struct-SQL \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u67e5\u8be2\u6267\u884c\u8ba1\u5212\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u84dd\u56fe\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u7528\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u4f7f\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6a21\u4eff\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6587\u672c\u8f6cSQL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6bd4\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u84b8\u998f\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u53478.1%\uff1b\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u4f18\u52bf\u6765\u81ea\u8bed\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u903b\u8f91\u84dd\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u6559\u5b66\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u8f6cSQL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Unlike the well-established autoregressive language modeling paradigm, which has a plethora of standard training and inference libraries, implementations of non-autoregressive language modeling have largely been bespoke making it difficult to perform systematic comparisons of different methods. Moreover, each non-autoregressive language model typically requires it own data collation, loss, and prediction logic, making it challenging to reuse common components. In this work, we present the XLM python package, which is designed to make implementing small non-autoregressive language models faster with a secondary goal of providing a suite of small pre-trained models (through a companion xlm-models package) that can be used by the research community.

New sensors and classification approaches like TLS and deep learning achieve state-of-the art accuracy but their decision processes remain unclear. Methods such as Finer-CAM (Class Activation Mapping) can highlight features in TLS projections that contribute to the classification of a target species, yet are uncommon in similar looking contrastive tree species. We propose a novel method linking Finer-CAM explanations to segments of TLS projections representing structural tree features to systemically evaluate which features drive species discrimination. Using TLS data from 2,445 trees across seven European tree species, we trained and validated five YOLOv8 models with cross-validation, reaching a mean accuracy of 96% (SD = 0.24%). Analysis of 630 saliency maps shows the models primarily rely on crown features in TLS projections for species classification. While this result is pronounced in Silver Birch, European Beech, English oak, and Norway spruce, stem features contribute more frequently to the differentiation of European ash, Scots pine, and Douglas fir.

While general-purpose programming languages are well supported, generating code for domain-specific languages remains a challenging problem for LLMs. In this paper, we focus on the LLM-based generation of code for Answer Set Programming (ASP), a particularly effective approach for finding solutions to combinatorial search problems. The effectiveness of LLMs in ASP code generation is currently hindered by the limited number of examples seen during their initial pre-training phase.\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel ASP-solver-in-the-loop approach for solver-guided instruction-tuning of LLMs to addressing the highly complex semantic parsing task inherent in ASP code generation. Our method only requires problem specifications in natural language and their solutions. Specifically, we sample ASP statements for program continuations from LLMs for unriddling logic puzzles. Leveraging the special property of declarative ASP programming that partial encodings increasingly narrow down the solution space, we categorize them into chosen and rejected instances based on solver feedback. We then apply supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs on the curated data and further improve robustness using a solver-guided search that includes best-of-N sampling.

Uses publicly available METAR surface observations and TAF forecast data for benchmarking", "summary": "Short-term prediction (nowcasting) of low-visibility and precipitation events is critical for aviation safety and operational efficiency. Current operational approaches rely on computationally intensive numerical weather prediction guidance and human-issued TAF products, which often exhibit conservative biases and limited temporal resolution. This study presents a lightweight gradient boosting framework (XGBoost) trained exclusively on surface observation data (METAR) and enhanced through physics-guided feature engineering based on thermodynamic principles. The framework is evaluated across 11 international airports representing distinct climatic regimes (including SCEL, KJFK, KORD, KDEN, SBGR, and VIDP) using historical data from 2000 to 2024. Results suggest that the model successfully captures underlying local physical processes without manual configuration. In a blind comparative evaluation against operational TAF forecasts, the automated model achieved substantially higher detection rates at tactical horizons (3 hours), with a 2.5 to 4.0 times improvement in recall while reducing false alarms. Furthermore, SHAP analysis reveals that the model performs an implicit reconstruction of local physical drivers (advection, radiation, and subsidence), providing actionable explainability for operational situational awareness.\n  Keywords: aviation meteorology; physics-guided machine learning; explainable artificial intelligence; lightweight machine learning; nowcasting; METAR; TAF verification; edge computing", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eXGBoost\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5730\u9762\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff08METAR\uff09\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u539f\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u80fd\u89c1\u5ea6\u548c\u964d\u6c34\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u77ed\u65f6\u9884\u62a5\uff08\u73b0\u5728\u9884\u62a5\uff09\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u572811\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u6c14\u5019\u533a\u7684\u56fd\u9645\u673a\u573a\uff08\u5982SCEL\u3001KJFK\u3001KORD\u7b49\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u8de8\u5ea6\u4e3a2000\u81f32024\u5e74\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6218\u672f\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff083\u5c0f\u65f6\uff09\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027TAF\u9884\u62a5\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u63d0\u53472.5\u81f34.0\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u3002SHAP\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u5f0f\u91cd\u6784\u4e86\u5c40\u5730\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5e73\u6d41\u3001\u8f90\u5c04\u3001\u4e0b\u6c89\uff09\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u8fd0\u884c\u6001\u52bf\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u822a\u7a7a\u6c14\u8c61\u4e1a\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u6570\u503c\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u751f\u6210\u7684TAF\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4fdd\u5b88\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u77ed\u65f6\u9884\u62a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u98de\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u8fd0\u8425\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528XGBoost\u6784\u5efa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528METAR\u5730\u9762\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u539f\u7406\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6c14\u5019\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SHAP\u5206\u6790\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u57283\u5c0f\u65f6\u6218\u672f\u9884\u62a5\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u76f8\u6bd4\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027TAF\u9884\u62a5\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\uff08\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff09\u63d0\u9ad82.5\u81f34.0\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62a5\uff1bSHAP\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u9690\u5f0f\u6355\u6349\u5c40\u5730\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08\u5982\u5e73\u6d41\u3001\u8f90\u5c04\u3001\u4e0b\u6c89\uff09\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u4f4e\u80fd\u89c1\u5ea6\u548c\u964d\u6c34\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9ad8\u65f6\u6548\u6027\u77ed\u65f6\u9884\u62a5\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

We introduce a method that approaches video generation in a filmmaker-like manner. Instead of creating a video in one step, our proposed pipeline first uses a large language model to generate a detailed production script. This script guides a text-to-image model in creating consistent visuals for each character, which then serve as anchors for a video generation model to synthesize each scene individually. Our baseline comparisons validate the necessity of this multi-stage decomposition; specifically, we observe that removing the visual anchoring mechanism results in a catastrophic drop in character consistency scores (from 7.99 to 0.55), confirming that visual priors are essential for identity preservation. Furthermore, we analyze cultural disparities in current models, revealing distinct biases in subject consistency and dynamic degree between Indian vs Western-themed generations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7c7b\u7535\u5f71\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8be6\u7ec6\u5267\u672c\uff0c\u518d\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u89d2\u8272\u89c6\u89c9\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u7531\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u573a\u666f\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u79fb\u9664\u89c6\u89c9\u951a\u70b9\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u89d2\u8272\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\uff08\u4ece7.99\u964d\u81f30.55\uff09\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u89c6\u89c9\u5148\u9a8c\u5bf9\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u4e0e\u897f\u65b9\u4e3b\u9898\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6587\u5316\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891AI\u5728\u751f\u6210\u957f\u7bc7\u8fde\u8d2f\u89c6\u9891\u6545\u4e8b\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u89d2\u8272\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8be6\u7ec6\u751f\u4ea7\u811a\u672c\uff1b\u63a5\u7740\u7528\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u6839\u636e\u811a\u672c\u751f\u6210\u89d2\u8272\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u951a\u70b9\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u4ee5\u8fd9\u4e9b\u951a\u70b9\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u7531\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u9010\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u79fb\u9664\u89c6\u89c9\u951a\u70b9\u673a\u5236\u540e\uff0c\u89d2\u8272\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u4ece7.99\u9aa4\u964d\u81f30.55\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u4e0e\u897f\u65b9\u4e3b\u9898\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6587\u5316\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u4e3b\u4f53\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u53d9\u4e8b\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u89c6\u89c9\u951a\u70b9\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6587\u5316\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Coen"], "title": "When F1 Fails: Granularity-Aware Evaluation for Dialogue Topic Segmentation", "comment": "17 pages, 2 figures. Evaluation and methodology study on dialogue topic segmentation", "summary": "Dialogue topic segmentation supports summarization, retrieval, memory management, and conversational continuity. Despite decades of prior work, evaluation practice in dialogue topic segmentation remains dominated by strict boundary matching and F1-based metrics, even as modern LLM-based conversational systems increasingly rely on segmentation to manage conversation history beyond the model's fixed context window, where unstructured context accumulation degrades efficiency and coherence.\n  This paper introduces an evaluation objective for dialogue topic segmentation that treats boundary density and segment coherence as primary criteria, alongside window-tolerant F1 (W-F1). Through extensive cross-dataset empirical evaluation, we show that reported performance differences across dialogue segmentation benchmarks are driven not by model quality, but by annotation granularity mismatches and sparse boundary labels. This indicates that many reported improvements arise from evaluation artifacts rather than improved boundary detection.\n  We evaluated multiple, structurally distinct dialogue segmentation strategies across eight dialogue datasets spanning task-oriented, open-domain, meeting-style, and synthetic interactions.

Yet, the inherent complexity and variable information density of videos present a significant bottleneck for current tokenizers, which rigidly compress all content at a fixed rate, leading to redundancy or information loss. Drawing inspiration from Shannon's information theory, this paper introduces InfoTok, a principled framework for adaptive video tokenization. We rigorously prove that existing data-agnostic training methods are suboptimal in representation length, and present a novel evidence lower bound (ELBO)-based algorithm that approaches theoretical optimality. Leveraging this framework, we develop a transformer-based adaptive compressor that enables adaptive tokenization. Empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art compression performance, saving 20% tokens without influence on performance, and achieving 2.3x compression rates while still outperforming prior heuristic adaptive approaches. By allocating tokens according to informational richness, InfoTok enables a more compressed yet accurate tokenization for video representation, offering valuable insights for future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u8bcd\u6846\u67b6InfoTok\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u56fa\u5b9a\u901f\u7387\u5206\u8bcd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u6216\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6b21\u4f18\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0b\u754c\uff08ELBO\uff09\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u903c\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u3002\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u538b\u7f29\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b020%\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u8282\u7701\u548c2.3\u500d\u538b\u7f29\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u901f\u7387\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5197\u4f59\u6216\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9999\u519c\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8eELBO\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efaTransformer-based\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6309\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u4ee4\u724c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u8282\u770120%\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u8fbe2.3\u500d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5df2\u6709\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "InfoTok\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u8bcd\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

Applied to benchmark (Mini-ARC) tasks, our method produces Solomonoff-weighted mixtures for per-cell predictions, yielding conservative, uncertainty-aware outputs even when hypotheses are noisy or partially incorrect. Compared to Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), Solomonoff scoring spreads probability more evenly across competing hypotheses, while BMA concentrates weight on the most likely but potentially flawed candidates.

We explore both an end-to-end and two-stage variants of the approach, finding that the two-stage pipeline performs better on long and information-dense documents. Experiments on long-form summarisation datasets demonstrate that our method consistently improves factual consistency while preserving relevance and overall quality. On GovReport, our best approach has improved ROUGE-L by 4.1 points and achieves about 35% gains in SummaC scores.

However, existing MMRAG methods fail to clarify the reasoning logic behind retrieval and response generation, which limits the explainability of the results. To address this gap, we propose to introduce reinforcement learning into multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation, enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models through a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework to achieve explainable multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation. Specifically, in the first stage, rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning is employed to perform coarse-grained point-wise ranking of multi-modal documents, effectively filtering out those that are significantly irrelevant. In the second stage, reasoning-based reinforcement fine-tuning is utilized to jointly optimize fine-grained list-wise ranking and answer generation, guiding multi-modal large language models to output explainable reasoning logic in the MMRAG process.

In this work, we study distribution restoration with abundant noisy samples, assuming the corruption process is available as a black-box generator. We show that this task can be framed as a one-sided entropic optimal transport problem and solved via an EM-like algorithm. We further provide a test criterion to determine whether the true underlying distribution is recoverable under per-sample information loss, and show that in otherwise unrecoverable cases, a small number of clean samples can render the distribution largely recoverable. Building on these insights, we introduce SFBD-OMNI, a bridge model-based framework that maps corrupted sample distributions to the ground-truth distribution. Our method generalizes Stochastic Forward-Backward Deconvolution (SFBD; Lu et al., 2025) to handle arbitrary measurement models beyond Gaussian corruption. Experiments across benchmark datasets and diverse measurement settings demonstrate significant improvements in both qualitative and quantitative performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5e03\u6062\u590d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u6c61\u67d3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ed1\u7bb1\u751f\u6210\u5668\u83b7\u53d6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5355\u8fb9\u71b5\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u7c7b\u4f3cEM\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\u51c6\u5219\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u771f\u5b9e\u5206\u5e03\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u6062\u590d\uff1b\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u5c11\u91cf\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u4f7f\u539f\u672c\u4e0d\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5f97\u57fa\u672c\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSFBD-OMNI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5e03\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e86\u539f\u6709SFBD\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6c61\u67d3\u7b49\u4efb\u610f\u6d4b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u89c2\u6d4b\u6837\u672c\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u800c\u90e8\u5206\u4e14\u542b\u566a\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u76f8\u5bf9\u5bb9\u6613\u6536\u96c6\u3002\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u5927\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\u6062\u590d\u771f\u5b9e\u5206\u5e03\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5f53\u6c61\u67d3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5df2\u77e5\u4f46\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u80fd\u7ed3\u5408\u5c11\u91cf\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5206\u5e03\u6062\u590d\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e00\u7ef4\u71b5\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u7c7b\u4f3cEM\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u6027\u5224\u522b\u51c6\u5219\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5224\u65ad\u5728\u6bcf\u6837\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u6027\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u6865\u63a5\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6SFBD-OMNI\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u5206\u5e03\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u6d4b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u975e\u4ec5\u9650\u9ad8\u65af\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd8\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\u65f6\u4ecd\u53ef\u5224\u65ad\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u6027\uff0c\u5c11\u91cf\u6e05\u6d01\u6837\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u5927\u5e45\u6539\u5584\u6062\u590d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "SFBD-OMNI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6062\u590d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u9ad8\u65af\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u89c2\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This global view helps organize prior knowledge, interpret new information, and integrate evidence dispersed across a document, as revealed by the Mindscape-Aware Capability of humans in psychology. Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems lack such guidance and therefore struggle with long-context tasks. In this paper, we propose Mindscape-Aware RAG (MiA-RAG), the first approach that equips LLM-based RAG systems with explicit global context awareness. MiA-RAG builds a mindscape through hierarchical summarization and conditions both retrieval and generation on this global semantic representation.

Based on human-examined prompts and QA pairs, UmniBench leverages UMM itself to evaluate its generation and editing ability with its understanding ability. This simple but effective paradigm allows comprehensive evaluation of UMMs. Second, UmniBench covers 13 major domains and more than 200 concepts, ensuring a thorough inspection of UMMs. Moreover, UmniBench can also decouple and separately evaluate understanding, generation, and editing abilities, providing a fine-grained assessment. Based on UmniBench, we benchmark 24 popular models, including both UMMs and single-ability large models.

Even state-of-the-art models such as Whisper struggle to maintain accuracy under varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). This study presents a robust noise-sensitive ASR error correction framework that combines multiple hypotheses and noise-aware modeling. Using noisy Persian speech, we generate 5-best hypotheses from a modified Whisper-large decoder. Error Level Noise (ELN) is introduced as a representation that captures semantic- and token-level disagreement across hypotheses, quantifying the linguistic distortions caused by noise. ELN thus provides a direct measure of noise-induced uncertainty, enabling the LLM to reason about the reliability of each hypothesis during correction. Three models are evaluated: (1) a base LLaMA-2-7B model without fine-tuning, (2) a fine-tuned variant trained on text-only hypotheses, and (3) a noise-conditioned model integrating ELN embeddings at both sentence and word levels. Experimental results demonstrate that the ELN-conditioned model achieves substantial reductions in Word Error Rate (WER). Specifically, on the challenging Mixed Noise test set, the proposed Fine-tuned + ELN (Ours) model reduces the WER from a baseline of 31.10\\% (Raw Whisper) to 24.84\\%, significantly surpassing the Fine-tuned (No ELN) text-only baseline of 30.79\\%, whereas the original LLaMA-2-7B model increased the WER to 64.58\\%, demonstrating that it is unable to correct Persian errors on its own.

Canopy heights were derived from annual SPOT-6/7 composites using a hierarchical transformer model (PVTv2) trained on high-resolution airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. To enable robust change detection across heterogeneous acquisitions, we developed a dedicated post-processing pipeline combining co-registration and spatio-temporal total variation denoising. Validation against ALS revisits across 19 sites and 5,087 National Forest Inventory plots shows that FORMSpoT-$\u0394$ substantially outperforms existing disturbance products. In mountainous forests, where disturbances are small and spatially fragmented, FORMSpoT-$\u0394$ achieves an F1-score of 0.44, representing an order of magnitude higher than existing benchmarks. By enabling tree-level monitoring of forest dynamics at national scale, FORMSpoT-$\u0394$ provides a unique tool to analyze management practices, detect early signals of forest decline, and better quantify carbon losses from subtle disturbances such as thinning or selective logging.

To appear in Hudl Performance Insights 2025", "summary": "Transfers play a pivotal role in shaping a football club's success, yet forecasting whether a transfer will succeed remains difficult due to the strong context-dependence of on-field performance. Existing evaluation practices often rely on static summary statistics or post-hoc value models, which fail to capture how a player's contribution adapts to a new tactical environment or different teammates. To address this gap, we introduce EventGPT, a player-conditioned, value-aware next-event prediction model built on a GPT-style autoregressive transformer. Our model treats match play as a sequence of discrete tokens, jointly learning to predict the next on-ball action's type, location, timing, and its estimated residual On-Ball Value (rOBV) based on the preceding context and player identity. A key contribution of this framework is the ability to perform counterfactual simulations. By substituting learned player embeddings into new event sequences, we can simulate how a player's behavioral distribution and value profile would change when placed in a different team or tactical structure. Evaluated on five seasons of Premier League event data, EventGPT outperforms existing sequence-based baselines in next-event prediction accuracy and spatial precision. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model's practical utility for transfer analysis through case studies-such as comparing striker performance across different systems and identifying stylistic replacements for specific roles-showing that our approach provides a principled method for evaluating transfer fit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faEventGPT\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eGPT\u98ce\u683c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52Transformer\u7684\u7403\u5458\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u3001\u4ef7\u503c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u6bd4\u8d5b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89c6\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u6807\u8bb0\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u7403\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u53ca\u5176\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6709\u7403\u4ef7\u503c\uff08rOBV\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66ff\u6362\u7403\u5458\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7403\u961f\u6216\u6218\u672f\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u4ef7\u503c\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u5728\u82f1\u8d85\u4e94\u4e2a\u8d5b\u5b63\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0cEventGPT\u5728\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8f6c\u4f1a\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5982\u8de8\u4f53\u7cfb\u6bd4\u8f83\u524d\u950b\u8868\u73b0\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u66ff\u4ee3\u8005\u7b49\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f6c\u4f1a\u9002\u914d\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8f6c\u4f1a\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u6216\u4e8b\u540e\u4ef7\u503c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7403\u5458\u5728\u65b0\u6218\u672f\u73af\u5883\u6216\u4e0d\u540c\u961f\u53cb\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u8f6c\u4f1a\u6210\u529f\u4e0e\u5426\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u7403\u5458\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u4ef7\u503c\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaEventGPT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528GPT\u5f0f\u81ea\u56de\u5f52Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u53ca\u6b8b\u5dee\u6709\u7403\u4ef7\u503c\uff08rOBV\uff09\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7403\u5458\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7403\u5458\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u56e2\u961f\u6216\u6218\u672f\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u82f1\u8d85\u4e94\u8d5b\u5b63\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0cEventGPT\u5728\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u8f6c\u4f1a\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5982\u8de8\u4f53\u7cfb\u6bd4\u8f83\u7403\u5458\u8868\u73b0\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u6218\u672f\u9002\u914d\u578b\u66ff\u4ee3\u8005\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "EventGPT\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u6f14\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8f6c\u4f1a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u7403\u5458\u5728\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ff1\u4e50\u90e8\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u79d1\u5b66\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

A key challenge in camera-controlled video generation is ensuring fidelity to the specified camera pose, while maintaining view consistency and reasoning about occluded geometry from limited observations. To address this, existing methods either train trajectory-conditioned video generation model on trajectory-video pair dataset, or estimate depth from the input video to reproject it along a target trajectory and generate the unprojected regions. Nevertheless, existing methods struggle to generate camera-pose-faithful, high-quality videos for two main reasons: (1) reprojection-based approaches are highly susceptible to errors caused by inaccurate depth estimation; and (2) the limited diversity of camera trajectories in existing datasets restricts learned models. To address these limitations, we present InfCam, a depth-free, camera-controlled video-to-video generation framework with high pose fidelity. The framework integrates two key components: (1) infinite homography warping, which encodes 3D camera rotations directly within the 2D latent space of a video diffusion model. Conditioning on this noise-free rotational information, the residual parallax term is predicted through end-to-end training to achieve high camera-pose fidelity; and (2) a data augmentation pipeline that transforms existing synthetic multiview datasets into sequences with diverse trajectories and focal lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that InfCam outperforms baseline methods in camera-pose accuracy and visual fidelity, generalizing well from synthetic to real-world data.

Pok\u00e9mon battles demand reasoning about type matchups, statistical trade-offs, and risk assessment, skills that mirror human strategic thinking. This work examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as competent battle agents, capable of both making tactically sound decisions and generating novel, balanced game content. We developed a turn-based Pok\u00e9mon battle system where LLMs select moves based on battle state rather than pre-programmed logic. The framework captures essential Pok\u00e9mon mechanics: type effectiveness multipliers, stat-based damage calculations, and multi-Pok\u00e9mon team management. Through systematic evaluation across multiple model architectures we measured win rates, decision latency, type-alignment accuracy, and token efficiency. These results suggest LLMs can function as dynamic game opponents without domain-specific training, offering a practical alternative to reinforcement learning for turn-based strategic games. The dual capability of tactical reasoning and content creation, positions LLMs as both players and designers, with implications for procedural generation and adaptive difficulty systems in interactive entertainment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u5b9d\u53ef\u68a6\u6218\u6597\u4e2d\u7684\u6218\u7565\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56de\u5408\u5236\u7684\u6218\u6597\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8ba9LLMs\u6839\u636e\u6218\u6597\u72b6\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u8bbe\u903b\u8f91\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u80dc\u7387\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u7c7b\u578b\u5339\u914d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4ee4\u724c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u65e0\u9700\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u6e38\u620f\u5bf9\u624b\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u6218\u672f\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u53cc\u91cd\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u751f\u6210\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u96be\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u4e13\u95e8\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u80dc\u4efb\u5b9d\u53ef\u68a6\u6218\u6597\u4e2d\u7684\u6218\u672f\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u6e38\u620f\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u751f\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u56de\u5408\u5236\u5b9d\u53ef\u68a6\u6218\u6597\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f7fLLMs\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6218\u6597\u72b6\u6001\u81ea\u4e3b\u9009\u62e9\u52a8\u4f5c\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u7c7b\u578b\u514b\u5236\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u4f24\u5bb3\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ca\u591a\u5b9d\u53ef\u68a6\u961f\u4f0d\u7ba1\u7406\u7b49\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u672a\u8fdb\u884c\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6218\u672f\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u80dc\u7387\u3001\u5408\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u9ad8\u7c7b\u578b\u5339\u914d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u6e38\u620f\u5bf9\u624b\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u591f\u80dc\u4efb\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u56de\u5408\u5236\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u6218\u672f\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u73a9\u5bb6\u4e0e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e92\u52a8\u5a31\u4e50\u4e2d\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u751f\u6210\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u96be\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

We investigate whether training on intentionally flawed reasoning traces can teach models to detect and recover from such errors without degrading standard problem-solving ability. Using competition-level problems from MATH-lighteval, we generate CoT prefixes containing exactly one controlled error, either a calculation error (sign flips, dropped terms) or a reasoning error (misapplied rules, unjustified logical steps), and fine-tune Qwen3-4B with GRPO using a binary final-answer reward. Our Mixed-CoT-RL model matches standard RL on clean problems (41% vs 41%) while substantially outperforming it on problems prefilled with flawed reasoning (24% vs 19%). Notably, clean-only RL fine-tuning degrades robustness below the untuned baseline 19% vs. 20%), indicating that conventional training increases susceptibility to misleading prefills. Among error types, training on reasoning errors yields greater robustness gains than calculation errors alone, with mixed training performing best.

Iakovidis"], "title": "Interpretable Similarity of Synthetic Image Utility", "comment": "Submitted for journal publication", "summary": "Synthetic medical image data can unlock the potential of deep learning (DL)-based clinical decision support (CDS) systems through the creation of large scale, privacy-preserving, training sets. Despite the significant progress in this field, there is still a largely unanswered research question: \"How can we quantitatively assess the similarity of a synthetically generated set of images with a set of real images in a given application domain?\". Today, answers to this question are mainly provided via user evaluation studies, inception-based measures, and the classification performance achieved on synthetic images. This paper proposes a novel measure to assess the similarity between synthetically generated and real sets of images, in terms of their utility for the development of DL-based CDS systems. Inspired by generalized neural additive models, and unlike inception-based measures, the proposed measure is interpretable (Interpretable Utility Similarity, IUS), explaining why a synthetic dataset could be more useful than another one in the context of a CDS system based on clinically relevant image features. The experimental results on publicly available datasets from various color medical imaging modalities including endoscopic, dermoscopic and fundus imaging, indicate that selecting synthetic images of high utility similarity using IUS can result in relative improvements of up to 54.6% in terms of classification performance. The generality of IUS for synthetic data assessment is demonstrated also for greyscale X-ray and ultrasound imaging modalities.

One challenge is that human concepts themselves are fluid: conceptual boundaries can shift, split, and merge as inquiry progresses (e.g., Pluto is no longer considered a planet). To make progress, we need a definition of \"concept\" that is not merely a dictionary label, but a structure that can be revised, compared, and aligned across agents. We propose an algorithmic-information viewpoint that treats a concept as an information object defined only through its structural relation to an agent's total experience. The core constraint is determination: a set of parts forms a reversible consistency relation if any missing part is recoverable from the others (up to the standard logarithmic slack in Kolmogorov-style identities). This reversibility prevents \"concepts\" from floating free of experience and turns concept existence into a checkable structural claim. To judge whether a decomposition is natural, we define excess information, measuring the redundancy overhead introduced by splitting experience into multiple separately described parts. On top of these definitions, we formulate dialectics as an optimization dynamics: as new patches of information appear (or become contested), competing concepts bid to explain them via shorter conditional descriptions, driving systematic expansion, contraction, splitting, and merging. Finally, we formalize low-cost concept transmission and multi-agent alignment using small grounds/seeds that allow another agent to reconstruct the same concept under a shared protocol, making communication a concrete compute-bits trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper proposes a formal, algorithmic-information-based definition of 'concept' that evolves naturally through experience.

Project page: https://junyingw.github.io/paper/dgh", "summary": "The creation of photorealistic dynamic hair remains a major challenge in digital human modeling because of the complex motions, occlusions, and light scattering. Existing methods often resort to static capture and physics-based models that do not scale as they require manual parameter fine-tuning to handle the diversity of hairstyles and motions, and heavy computation to obtain high-quality appearance. In this paper, we present Dynamic Gaussian Hair (DGH), a novel framework that efficiently learns hair dynamics and appearance. We propose: (1) a coarse-to-fine model that learns temporally coherent hair motion dynamics across diverse hairstyles; (2) a strand-guided optimization module that learns a dynamic 3D Gaussian representation for hair appearance with support for differentiable rendering, enabling gradient-based learning of view-consistent appearance under motion. Unlike prior simulation-based pipelines, our approach is fully data-driven, scales with training data, and generalizes across various hairstyles and head motion sequences. Additionally, DGH can be seamlessly integrated into a 3D Gaussian avatar framework, enabling realistic, animatable hair for high-fidelity avatar representation.

The core algorithm combines gradient-aligned low-rank updates with structured orthogonal transformations through layer-wise mixing and introduces unitary constraints in selected sub-layers to stabilize deep optimization. In tandem with lightweight, label-free data governance steps, including language identification, near-duplicate removal, and quality filtering, the framework targets accuracy, calibration, and cross-language parity under tight compute budgets. Across XNLI and FLORES, the hybrid approach delivers consistent gains over strong PEFT baselines while maintaining directional balance and improving probability calibration, as shown in Tables II and III. It is more resilient to lightweight orthographic variants, as shown in Table IV, and benefits additively from simple governance steps, as shown in Table V. Training footprint measurements indicate modest overhead and a favorable cost-quality frontier, as shown in Table VI and Figure 2. Together, these results show that hybrid and unitary PEFT provide a stable and accessible path to resource-efficient multilingual adaptation when paired with practical data governance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6cbb\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6b63\u4ea4\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u95f4\u6df7\u5408\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u9009\u5b9a\u5b50\u5c42\u7684\u9149\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u914d\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6cbb\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff08\u5982\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u8fd1\u4f3c\u91cd\u590d\u5220\u9664\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u5728XNLI\u548cFLORES\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6982\u7387\u6821\u51c6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u8f7b\u91cf\u6b63\u5b57\u6cd5\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u53e0\u52a0\u53d7\u76ca\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u6cbb\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u9500\u5c0f\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6210\u672c-\u8d28\u91cf\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u5730\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u6709\u6548\u6570\u636e\u6cbb\u7406\u4e0e\u65b0\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\u7684\u534f\u540c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6b63\u4ea4\u53d8\u6362\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u95f4\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u5b50\u5c42\u65bd\u52a0\u9149\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u4f18\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u6cbb\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u8fd1\u4f3c\u91cd\u590d\u6570\u636e\u5254\u9664\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u7b5b\u9009\u3002", "result": "\u5728XNLI\u548cFLORES\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e3b\u6d41PEFT\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u6982\u7387\u6821\u51c6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6b63\u5b57\u6cd5\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5404\u9879\u6cbb\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u5177\u6709\u53e0\u52a0\u589e\u76ca\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u9500\u5c0f\uff0c\u6210\u672c-\u8d28\u91cf\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6cbb\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u6df7\u5408\u9149\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6027\u3002"}}

This effect has been studied extensively in classification tasks, but not in sequential decision-making, where an agent learns a policy to achieve an objective by taking actions in an environment. In this paper, we translate the Rashomon effect to sequential decision-making. We define it as multiple policies that exhibit identical behavior, visiting the same states and selecting the same actions, while differing in their internal structure, such as feature attributions. Verifying identical behavior in sequential decision-making differs from classification. In classification, predictions can be directly compared to ground-truth labels. In sequential decision-making with stochastic transitions, the same policy may succeed or fail on any single trajectory due to randomness. We address this using formal verification methods that construct and compare the complete probabilistic behavior of each policy in the environment. Our experiments demonstrate that the Rashomon effect exists in sequential decision-making. We further show that ensembles constructed from the Rashomon set exhibit greater robustness to distribution shifts than individual policies.

Our formulation tightly and elegantly couples the two planning paradigms. It leverages reinforcement learning actions to inform the MPPI sampler, and adaptively aggregates MPPI samples to inform the value estimation. The resulting adaptive process leverages further MPPI exploration where value estimates are uncertain, and improves training robustness and the overall resulting policies. This results in a robust planning approach that can handle complex planning problems and easily adapts to different applications, as demonstrated over several domains, including race driving, modified Acrobot, and Lunar Lander with added obstacles. Our results in these domains show better data efficiency and overall performance in terms of both rewards and task success, with up to a 72% increase in success rate compared to existing approaches, as well as accelerated convergence (x2.1) compared to non-adaptive sampling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08MPC\uff09\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u89c4\u5212\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8e\u6307\u5bfcMPPI\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u805a\u5408MPPI\u6837\u672c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u4ef7\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u4ef7\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8d5b\u8f66\u9a7e\u9a76\u3001\u6539\u8fdb\u578bAcrobot\u548c\u5e26\u969c\u788d\u7269\u7684Lunar Lander\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3001\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe72%\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u52a0\u5feb2.1\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0eMPC\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0eMPPI\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u6307\u5bfcMPPI\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6839\u636e\u91c7\u6837\u7ed3\u679c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534772%\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad82.1\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

These problems often lead to delays in treatment and poor health outcomes. Most current AI and deep learning diagnostic systems are not very interactive or transparent, making them less effective in real-world, patient-centered environments. This research introduces a diagnostic chatbot powered by a Large Language Model (LLM), using GPT-4o, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and explainable AI techniques. The chatbot engages patients in a dynamic conversation, helping to extract and normalize symptoms while prioritizing potential diagnoses through similarity matching and adaptive questioning. With Chain-of-Thought prompting, the system also offers more transparent reasoning behind its diagnoses. When tested against traditional machine learning models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and KNN, the LLM-based system delivered impressive results, achieving an accuracy of 90% and Top-3 accuracy of 100%.

To overcome this, we introduce controlled synthetic pretraining tasks that isolate and evaluate core model capabilities. Within this framework, we discover CANON LAYERS: lightweight architectural components -- named after the musical term \"canon\" -- that promote horizontal information flow across neighboring tokens. Canon layers compute weighted sums of nearby token representations and integrate seamlessly into Transformers, linear attention, state-space models, or any sequence architecture.\n  We present 12 key results. This includes how Canon layers enhance reasoning depth (e.g., by $2\\times$), reasoning breadth, knowledge manipulation, etc. They lift weak architectures like NoPE to match RoPE, and linear attention to rival SOTA linear models like Mamba2/GDN -- validated both through synthetic tasks and real-world academic-scale pretraining. This synthetic playground offers an economical, principled path to isolate core model capabilities often obscured at academic scales. Equipped with infinite high-quality data, it may even PREDICT how future architectures will behave as training pipelines improve -- e.g., through better data curation or RL-based post-training -- unlocking deeper reasoning and hierarchical inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u5408\u6210\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9694\u79bb\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCanon Layers\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u67b6\u6784\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5176\u7075\u611f\u6765\u81ea\u97f3\u4e50\u4e2d\u7684\u2018\u5361\u519c\u2019\uff0c\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u76f8\u90bb\u8bcd\u5143\u95f4\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6a2a\u5411\u6d41\u52a8\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c42\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u6c42\u548c\u90bb\u8fd1\u8bcd\u5143\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230Transformer\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u5e8f\u5217\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cCanon Layers\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\uff08\u5982\u63d0\u53472\u500d\uff09\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u5e7f\u5ea6\u53ca\u77e5\u8bc6\u64cd\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u80fd\u5c06\u5f31\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5982NoPE\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u63a5\u8fd1RoPE\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4f7f\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5ab2\u7f8eSOTA\u6a21\u578b\u5982Mamba2/GDN\u3002\u8be5\u5408\u6210\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u7ecf\u6d4e\u3001\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u5b66\u672f\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5e38\u88ab\u566a\u58f0\u63a9\u76d6\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65e0\u9650\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u6539\u8fdb\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u540e\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u63a8\u65ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b66\u672f\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u598213\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u30011000\u4ebf\u8bcd\u5143\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u5e38\u53d7\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6e05\u6670\u7406\u89e3\u67b6\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u73af\u5883\u6765\u5206\u79bb\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u5408\u6210\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ee5\u9694\u79bb\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165Canon Layers\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u67b6\u6784\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u6c42\u548c\u90bb\u8fd1\u8bcd\u5143\u8868\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a2a\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5e8f\u5217\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "Canon Layers\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\uff08\u59822\u500d\uff09\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u5e7f\u5ea6\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u64cd\u63a7\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u4f7f\u5f31\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5982NoPE\uff09\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0eRoPE\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7f\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5ab2\u7f8eMamba2/GDN\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u5b66\u672f\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5747\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63ed\u793a\u9690\u85cf\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u67b6\u6784\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Canon Layers\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u589e\u5f3a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u79cd\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u53d7\u63a7\u5408\u6210\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u7ecf\u6d4e\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

To express non-Markovian rewards, formalisms such as reward machines have been introduced to capture dependencies on histories. However, traditional reward machines lack the ability to model precise timing constraints, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. In this paper, we propose timed reward machines (TRMs), which are an extension of reward machines that incorporate timing constraints into the reward structure. TRMs enable more expressive specifications with tunable reward logic, for example, imposing costs for delays and granting rewards for timely actions. We study model-free RL frameworks (i.e., tabular Q-learning) for learning optimal policies with TRMs under digital and real-time semantics. Our algorithms integrate the TRM into learning via abstractions of timed automata, and employ counterfactual-imagining heuristics that exploit the structure of the TRM to improve the search. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our algorithm learns policies that achieve high rewards while satisfying the timing constraints specified by the TRM on popular RL benchmarks. Moreover, we conduct comparative studies of performance under different TRM semantics, along with ablations that highlight the benefits of counterfactual-imagining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65f6\u5e8f\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5668\uff08TRMs\uff09\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5668\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u5e8f\u654f\u611f\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8ba1\u65f6\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u60f3\u8c61\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u6ee1\u8db3\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u5efa\u6a21\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u654f\u611f\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u8868\u8fbe\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65f6\u5e8f\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5668\uff08TRMs\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u5f15\u5165\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u5982\u8868\u683cQ-learning\uff09\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8ba1\u65f6\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u60f3\u8c61\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u4e14\u6ee1\u8db3\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u60f3\u8c61\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65f6\u5e8f\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5668\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This is unlike common photos people can take of themselves. In this paper, we explore how to create a ``professional'' version of a person's photograph, i.e., in a chosen pose, in a simple environment, with good lighting, and standard black top/bottom clothing. A key challenge is to preserve the person's unique identity, face and body features while transforming the photo. If there would exist a large paired dataset of the same person photographed both ``in the wild'' and by a professional photographer, the problem would potentially be easier to solve. However, such data does not exist, especially for a large variety of identities. To that end, we propose two key insights: 1) Our method transforms the input photo and person's face to a canonical UV space, which is further coupled with reposing methodology to model occlusions and novel view synthesis. Operating in UV space allows us to leverage existing unpaired datasets. 2) We personalize the output photo via multi image finetuning. Our approach yields high-quality, reposed portraits and achieves strong qualitative and quantitative performance on real-world imagery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u666e\u901a\u4eba\u81ea\u62cd\u7684\u7167\u7247\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4e13\u4e1a\u6444\u5f71\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7406\u60f3\u59ff\u52bf\u3001\u7b80\u6d01\u80cc\u666f\u3001\u826f\u597d\u5149\u7167\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u7740\u88c5\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u662f\u4fdd\u6301\u4eba\u7269\u72ec\u7279\u8eab\u4efd\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u5916\u89c2\u53d8\u6362\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u91cf\u6210\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5373\u540c\u4e00\u4eba\u201c\u91ce\u751f\u201d\u81ea\u62cd\u4e0e\u4e13\u4e1a\u6444\u5f71\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff09\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff1a1\uff09\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4eba\u8138\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u7edf\u4e00\u7684UV\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u91cd\u5b9a\u59ff\u6280\u672f\u5efa\u6a21\u906e\u6321\u4e0e\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u5fae\u8c03\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u91cd\u5b9a\u59ff\u8096\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u666e\u901a\u81ea\u62cd\u7167\u4e0e\u4e13\u4e1a\u6444\u5f71\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5982\u5149\u7ebf\u3001\u6784\u56fe\u3001\u670d\u88c5\u7b49\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6210\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u81ea\u62cd\u5230\u4e13\u4e1a\u7167\u7247\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u6210\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u4fdd\u7559\u4e2a\u4f53\u8eab\u4efd\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e13\u4e1a\u98ce\u683c\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u53ca\u5176\u4eba\u8138\u6295\u5f71\u81f3\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684UV\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7b80\u5316\u59ff\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4e0e\u906e\u6321\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b2\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u91cd\u5b9a\u59ff\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u6210\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u7136\u903c\u771f\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u56fe\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u7528\u6237\u591a\u5f20\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u4f18\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8868\u8fbe\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u7b26\u5408\u4e13\u4e1a\u6444\u5f71\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u91cd\u5b9a\u59ff\u8096\u50cf\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u89c6\u89c9\u6548\u679c\u81ea\u7136\u6d41\u7545\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u59ff\u6001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff09\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u975e\u6210\u5bf9\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4e13\u4e1a\u8096\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u5728\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8eUV\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u91cd\u5b9a\u59ff\u4e0e\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u5fae\u8c03\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u4e2a\u4eba\u5f62\u8c61\u7f8e\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, their effectiveness heavily relies on supervised training with extensive labeled (e.g., question-answering pairs) or unlabeled datasets (e.g., code snippets), which are often expensive and difficult to obtain at scale. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a method IPC, an unsupervised framework that leverages Internal Probing of LLMs for Code generation without any external corpus, even unlabeled code snippets. We introduce the problem space probing, test understanding probing, solution space probing, and knowledge consolidation and reinforcement to probe the internal knowledge and confidence patterns existing in LLMs. Further, IPC identifies reliable code candidates through self-consistency mechanisms and representation-based quality estimation to train UCoder (coder with unsupervised learning). We validate the proposed approach across multiple code benchmarks, demonstrating that unsupervised methods can achieve competitive performance compared to supervised approaches while significantly reducing the dependency on labeled data and computational resources. Analytic experiments reveal that internal model states contain rich signals about code quality and correctness, and that properly harnessing these signals enables effective unsupervised learning for code generation tasks, opening new directions for training code LLMs in resource-constrained scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aIPC\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u6d4b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\uff09\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u95ee\u9898\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u6d4b\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7406\u89e3\u63a2\u6d4b\u3001\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5de9\u56fa\u5f3a\u5316\u7b49\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8868\u793a\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5019\u9009\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3UCoder\uff08\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff09\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u8574\u542b\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5408\u7406\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u83b7\u53d6\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faIPC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u7c7b\u5185\u90e8\u63a2\u6d4b\uff08\u95ee\u9898\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u5de9\u56fa\uff09\u6316\u6398\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8868\u793a\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b5b\u9009\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4ee3\u7801\u5019\u9009\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578bUCoder\u3002", "result": "IPC\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u751a\u81f3\u5ab2\u7f8e\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u8574\u542b\u4e30\u5bcc\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7b5b\u9009\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

This shift has triggered urgent debate regarding Anthropomorphism, the attribution of human characteristics to synthetic agents, and its potential to induce misplaced trust or emotional dependency. However, the causal link between more humanlike AI design and subsequent effects on engagement and trust has not been tested in realistic human-AI interactions with a global user pool. Prevailing safety frameworks continue to rely on theoretical assumptions derived from Western populations, overlooking the global diversity of AI users. Here, we address these gaps through two large-scale cross-national experiments (N=3,500) across 10 diverse nations, involving real-time and open-ended interactions with an AI system. We find that when evaluating an AI's human-likeness, users focus less on the kind of theoretical aspects often cited in policy (e.g., sentience or consciousness), but rather applied, interactional cues like conversation flow or understanding the user's perspective. We also experimentally demonstrate that humanlike design levers can causally increase anthropomorphism among users; however, we do not find that humanlike design universally increases behavioral measures for user engagement and trust, as previous theoretical work suggests. Instead, part of the connection between human-likeness and behavioral outcomes is fractured by culture: specific design choices that foster self-reported trust in AI-systems in some populations (e.g., Brazil) may trigger the opposite result in others (e.g., Japan). Our findings challenge prevailing narratives of inherent risk in humanlike AI design.

However, executing such multi-stage pipelines efficiently on mobile devices remains challenging due to redundant model loads and fragmented execution. We introduce Atom, an on-device system that restructures video-language pipelines for fast and efficient execution. Atom decomposes a billion-parameter model into reusable modules, such as the visual encoder and language decoder, and reuses them across subtasks like captioning, reasoning, and indexing. This reuse-centric design eliminates repeated model loading and enables parallel execution, reducing end-to-end latency without sacrificing performance. On commodity smartphones, Atom achieves 27--33% faster execution compared to non-reuse baselines, with only marginal performance drop ($\\leq$ 2.3 Recall@1 in retrieval, $\\leq$ 1.5 CIDEr in captioning).

Lin", "Vlad I. Morariu"], "title": "Text-Conditioned Background Generation for Editable Multi-Layer Documents", "comment": null, "summary": "We present a framework for document-centric background generation with multi-page editing and thematic continuity. To ensure text regions remain readable, we employ a \\emph{latent masking} formulation that softly attenuates updates in the diffusion space, inspired by smooth barrier functions in physics and numerical optimization. In addition, we introduce \\emph{Automated Readability Optimization (ARO)}, which automatically places semi-transparent, rounded backing shapes behind text regions. ARO determines the minimal opacity needed to satisfy perceptual contrast standards (WCAG 2.2) relative to the underlying background, ensuring readability while maintaining aesthetic harmony without human intervention. Multi-page consistency is maintained through a summarization-and-instruction process, where each page is distilled into a compact representation that recursively guides subsequent generations. This design reflects how humans build continuity by retaining prior context, ensuring that visual motifs evolve coherently across an entire document. Our method further treats a document as a structured composition in which text, figures, and backgrounds are preserved or regenerated as separate layers, allowing targeted background editing without compromising readability. Finally, user-provided prompts allow stylistic adjustments in color and texture, balancing automated consistency with flexible customization.

In this work, we introduce CulturalToM-VQA, a new evaluation benchmark containing 5095 questions designed to probe ToM reasoning across diverse cultural contexts through visual question answering. The dataset captures culturally grounded cues such as rituals, attire, gestures, and interpersonal dynamics, enabling systematic evaluation of ToM reasoning beyond Western-centric benchmarks. Our dataset is built through a VLM-assisted human-in-the-loop pipeline, where human experts first curate culturally rich images across traditions, rituals, and social interactions; a VLM then assist in generating structured ToM-focused scene descriptions, which are refined into question-answer pairs spanning a taxonomy of six ToM tasks and four graded complexity levels.

To theoretically formalize the desired reasoning behaviors, this paper presents the Laws of Reasoning (LoRe), a unified framework that characterizes intrinsic reasoning patterns in LRMs. We first propose compute law with the hypothesis that the reasoning compute should scale linearly with question complexity. Beyond compute, we extend LoRe with a supplementary accuracy law. Since the question complexity is difficult to quantify in practice, we examine these hypotheses by two properties of the laws, monotonicity and compositionality. We therefore introduce LoRe-Bench, a benchmark that systematically measures these two tractable properties for large reasoning models. Evaluation shows that most reasoning models exhibit reasonable monotonicity but lack compositionality. In response, we develop an effective finetuning approach that enforces compute-law compositionality. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that better compliance with compute laws yields consistently improved reasoning performance on multiple benchmarks, and uncovers synergistic effects across properties and laws.

Infrared images and fire masks provide complementary thermal and boundary information, yet current methods are predominantly limited to binary mask modeling with inherent signal sparsity, failing to capture the complex dynamics of fire. While world models show promise in video generation, their physical inconsistencies pose significant challenges for fire forecasting. This paper introduces PhysFire-WM, a Physics-informed World Model for emulating Fire spread dynamics. Our approach internalizes combustion dynamics by encoding structured priors from a Physical Simulator to rectify physical discrepancies, coupled with a Cross-task Collaborative Training strategy (CC-Train) that alleviates the issue of limited information in mask-based modeling. Through parameter sharing and gradient coordination, CC-Train effectively integrates thermal radiation dynamics and spatial boundary delineation, enhancing both physical realism and geometric accuracy. Extensive experiments on a fine-grained multimodal fire dataset demonstrate the superior accuracy of PhysFire-WM in fire spread prediction. Validation underscores the importance of physical priors and cross-task collaboration, providing new insights for applying physics-informed world models to disaster prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPhysFire-WM\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u706b\u707e\u8513\u5ef6\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5148\u9a8c\u6765\u7ea0\u6b63\u7269\u7406\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u534f\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08CC-Train\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u70ed\u8f90\u5c04\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fb9\u754c\u5212\u5206\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u706b\u707e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u706b\u707e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u706b\u707e\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u4e8c\u503c\u63a9\u7801\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a00\u758f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u706b\u707e\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\uff1b\u800c\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5177\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5176\u5728\u706b\u707e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u5177\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPhysFire-WM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5148\u9a8c\u4ee5\u7ea6\u675f\u6a21\u578b\u7269\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u534f\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08CC-Train\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u70ed\u8f90\u5c04\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fb9\u754c\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u706b\u707e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cPhysFire-WM\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u706b\u707e\u8513\u5ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53ca\u51e0\u4f55\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u534f\u540c\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "PhysFire-WM\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u706b\u707e\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0e\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u534f\u540c\u5728\u707e\u5bb3\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Unlike conventional ensembles that often rely on homogeneous architectures, our approach combines architecturally diverse small transformer-based large language models (sLLMs) - BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, DeBERTa, and ELECTRA, each fully fine-tuned for emotion classification. To preserve error diversity, we minimize parameter convergence while taking advantage of the unique biases of each model. A dual-weighted voting mechanism integrates both global credibility (validation F1 score) and local confidence (instance-level probability) to dynamically weight model contributions. Experiments on the DAIR-AI dataset demonstrate that our credibility-confidence ensemble achieves a macro F1 score of 93.5 percent, surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks and significantly outperforming large-scale LLMs, including Falcon, Mistral, Qwen, and Phi, even after task-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). With only 595M parameters in total, our small LLMs ensemble proves more parameter-efficient and robust than models up to 7B parameters, establishing that carefully designed ensembles of small, fine-tuned models can outperform much larger LLMs in specialized natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as emotion detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u60c5\u611f\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u53d7\u5eb7\u591a\u585e\u966a\u5ba1\u56e2\u5b9a\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5c0f\u578bTransformer\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982BERT\u3001RoBERTa\u3001DistilBERT\u3001DeBERTa\u3001ELECTRA\uff09\uff0c\u5747\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5b8c\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u6536\u655b\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u9519\u8bef\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5404\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u6743\u91cd\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff08\u9a8c\u8bc1F1\u5206\u6570\uff09\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff08\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u6982\u7387\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u5728DAIR-AI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fbe\u523093.5%\u7684\u5b8fF1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u5305\u62ecFalcon\u3001Mistral\u3001Qwen\u548cPhi\u5728\u5185\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u914d\uff08LoRA\uff09\u540e\u4f9d\u7136\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002\u6574\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u4ec5\u542b5.95\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u6bd4\u9ad8\u8fbe70\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u7279\u5b9aNLP\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u540c\u8d28\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9519\u8bef\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5f3a\u5927\u4f46\u53c2\u6570\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u60c5\u611f\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u53cc\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e94\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5c0f\u578bTransformer\u6a21\u578b\uff08BERT\u3001RoBERTa\u3001DistilBERT\u3001DeBERTa\u3001ELECTRA\uff09\uff0c\u5747\u5168\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u5404\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u6743\u91cd\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6F1\uff09\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff08\u9884\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728DAIR-AI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f9793.5%\u7684\u5b8fF1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a70\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Falcon\u3001Mistral\u3001Qwen\u3001Phi\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5e94\u7528LoRA\u9002\u914d\u540e\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u6574\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5595M\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u3001\u591a\u6837\u5316\u3001\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u7279\u5b9a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u8d85\u8d8a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u9ad8\u6027\u80fdNLP\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

However, existing methods, including Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), all rely on annotated text-to-image pairs for aligning visual and textual modalities. This dependency introduces substantial cost and accuracy requirement in preparing high-quality datasets. At the same time, processing data from two modes also requires dual-tower encoders for most models, which also hinders their lightweight. To address these limitations, we introduce a ``Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training via Large-Language-Model-based Generation (LGCLIP)\" framework. LGCLIP leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate class-specific prompts that guide a diffusion model in synthesizing reference images. Afterwards these generated images serve as visual prototypes, and the visual features of real images are extracted and compared with the visual features of these prototypes to achieve comparative prediction. By optimizing prompt generation through the LLM and employing only a visual encoder, LGCLIP remains lightweight and efficient. Crucially, our framework requires only class labels as input during whole experimental procedure, eliminating the need for manually annotated image-text pairs and extra pre-processing. Experimental results validate the feasibility and efficiency of LGCLIP, demonstrating great performance in zero-shot classification tasks and establishing a novel paradigm for classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "LGCLIP\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bed\u8a00\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u751f\u6210\u7c7b\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u5e76\u9a71\u52a8\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u539f\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u7c7b\u522b\u6807\u7b7e\u5373\u53ef\u5b8c\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u56fe\u6587\u5bf9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982CLIP\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u56fe\u6587\u5bf9\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u51c6\u5907\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\uff08\u53cc\u5854\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff09\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u6ce8\u56fe\u6587\u5bf9\u3001\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c7b\u522b\u6807\u7b7e\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7c7b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u5bf9\u5e94\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u539f\u578b\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u539f\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u6574\u4e2a\u6d41\u7a0b\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7c7b\u522b\u6807\u7b7e\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u914d\u5bf9\u6216\u989d\u5916\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLGCLIP\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LGCLIP\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u65b0\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ec5\u4ee5\u7c7b\u522b\u6807\u7b7e\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

While this means that personality frameworks would be highly valuable tools to characterize and control LLMs' behavior, current approaches remain either costly (post-training) or brittle (prompt engineering). Probing and steering via linear directions has recently emerged as a cheap and efficient alternative. In this paper, we investigate whether linear directions aligned with the Big Five personality traits can be used for probing and steering model behavior. Using Llama 3.3 70B, we generate descriptions of 406 fictional characters and their Big Five trait scores. We then prompt the model with these descriptions and questions from the Alpaca questionnaire, allowing us to sample hidden activations that vary along personality traits in known, quantifiable ways. Using linear regression, we learn a set of per-layer directions in activation space, and test their effectiveness for probing and steering model behavior. Our results suggest that linear directions aligned with trait-scores are effective probes for personality detection, while their steering capabilities strongly depend on context, producing reliable effects in forced-choice tasks but limited influence in open-ended generation or when additional context is present in the prompt.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e2d\u4e0e\u4e94\u5927\u6027\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728Llama 3.3 70B\u4e0a\u751f\u6210406\u4e2a\u865a\u6784\u89d2\u8272\u53ca\u5176\u6027\u683c\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408Alpaca\u95ee\u5377\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u5b66\u4e60\u5404\u5c42\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u5411\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u683c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u751f\u6210\u6216\u5b58\u5728\u989d\u5916\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65f6\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u5f3a\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff08\u5982\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8106\u5f31\uff08\u5982\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff09\u3002\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u5411\u63a2\u9488\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u6027\u683c\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b406\u4e2a\u865a\u6784\u89d2\u8272\u53ca\u5176\u4e94\u5927\u6027\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u5f97\u5206\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528Alpaca\u95ee\u5377\u63d0\u95ee\uff0c\u91c7\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6027\u683c\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u5728\u5404\u5c42\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u6027\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u5411\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u6027\u683c\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u5411\u5728\u6027\u683c\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u683c\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u4f46\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u6216\u542b\u989d\u5916\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\uff0c\u5176\u5f15\u5bfc\u80fd\u529b\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u5f3a\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u9760\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e94\u5927\u6027\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u5411\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6027\u683c\u63a2\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6216\u81ea\u7531\u751f\u6210\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002"}}

This makes them particularly useful for applications like image retrieval, report generation, and classification in clinical settings. A potential issue to this approach is that CLIP-based models often under perform when interpreting negated phrases, which is especially problematic in the context of medical diagnosing. In this study, we evaluate the Stanford AIMI CheXagent model on its ability to correctly retrieve chest X-ray images using prompts with and without negation. The goal of this project is to understand where this model fails and then use it as a base model to improve its retrieval accuracy by fine tuning methods outlined in previous work. Results from this study show improvement in handling of negation in the CLIP model with a slight decrease in accuracy of positive prompt evaluation. Alongside retrieval accuracy, we examined internal model behavior through token attribution, t-SNE projection, and attention-head ablation to better characterize how each fine tuning approach reshaped the text encoders representation of negated clinical language. Through this work, we hope to better understand the internal behavior of CLIP and improve its handling of negation using clinically relevant language for improving its reliability in medical AI devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u65af\u5766\u798fAIMI CheXagent\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u542b\u5426\u5b9a\u548c\u4e0d\u542b\u5426\u5b9a\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u68c0\u7d22\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u7247\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5426\u5b9a\u77ed\u8bed\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5426\u5b9a\u8bed\u53e5\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u6b63\u9762\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7565\u6709\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bcd\u5143\u5f52\u56e0\u3001t-SNE\u6295\u5f71\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u6d88\u878d\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u5851\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u5426\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "CLIP\u7b49\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u5426\u5b9a\u77ed\u8bed\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u5c24\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5426\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65af\u5766\u798fAIMI CheXagent\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5176\u5728\u542b\u5426\u5b9a\u4e0e\u4e0d\u542b\u5426\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5df2\u6709\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8bcd\u5143\u5f52\u56e0\u3001t-SNE\u964d\u7ef4\u53ca\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u6d88\u878d\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5426\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u65f6\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5f97\u5230\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u6b63\u5411\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7565\u6709\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u5185\u90e8\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bf9\u5426\u5b9a\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u533b\u5b66\u5426\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u5426\u5b9a\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u533b\u7597AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

However, it still struggles with compositional image-text matching, particularly in accurately associating objects with their corresponding attributes, because its inherent global representation often overlooks fine-grained semantics for attribute binding. Existing methods often require additional training or extensive hard negative sampling, yet they frequently show limited generalization to novel compositional concepts and fail to fundamentally address the drawbacks of global representations. In this paper, we propose ABE-CLIP, a novel training-free Attribute Binding Enhancement method designed to strengthen attribute-object binding in CLIP-like models. Specifically, we employ a Semantic Refinement Mechanism to refine token embeddings for both object and attribute phrases in the text, thereby mitigating attribute confusion and improving semantic precision. We further introduce a Local Token-Patch Alignment strategy that computes similarity scores between refined textual tokens and their most relevant image patches. By aggregating localized similarity scores, ABE-CLIP computes the final image-text similarity. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that ABE-CLIP significantly improves attribute-object binding performance, even surpassing methods that require extensive training.", "AI": {"tldr": "ABE-CLIP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u7ed1\u5b9a\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u7cbe\u70bc\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c5e\u6027-\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ed1\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "CLIP\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u56fe\u6587\u5339\u914d\u4e2d\u56e0\u5168\u5c40\u8868\u793a\u5ffd\u7565\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u5173\u8054\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e0e\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u56f0\u96be\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u672a\u80fd\u6839\u672c\u89e3\u51b3\u5168\u5c40\u8868\u793a\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49\u7cbe\u70bc\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u77ed\u8bed\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ec6\u5316\u540e\u6587\u672c\u6807\u8bb0\u4e0e\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5f97\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u56fe\u6587\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cABE-CLIP\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c5e\u6027-\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ed1\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ABE-CLIP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584CLIP\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5c5e\u6027\u7ed1\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5168\u5c40\u8868\u793a\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Evaluation can be broadly grouped into objective (e.g., measuring the amount of greenery) and subjective (e.g., polling the perception of people) approaches, which may differ -- what people see and feel about how green a place is might not match the measurements of the actual amount of vegetation. In this work, we advance the state of the art by measuring such differences and explaining them through human, geographic, and spatial dimensions. The experiments rely on contextual information extracted from street view imagery and a comprehensive urban visual perception survey collected from 1,000 people across five countries with their extensive demographic and personality information. We analyze the discrepancies between objective measures (e.g., Green View Index (GVI)) and subjective scores (e.g., pairwise ratings), examining whether they can be explained by a variety of human and visual factors such as age group and spatial variation of greenery in the scene. The findings reveal that such discrepancies are comparable around the world and that demographics and personality do not play a significant role in perception. Further, while perceived and measured greenery correlate consistently across geographies (both where people and where imagery are from), where people live plays a significant role in explaining perceptual differences, with these two, as the top among seven, features that influences perceived greenery the most. This location influence suggests that cultural, environmental, and experiential factors substantially shape how individuals observe greenery in cities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8857\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6765\u81ea\u4e94\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb61000\u4eba\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u5e76\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5ba2\u89c2\u7eff\u8272\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u7eff\u89c6\u7387GVI\uff09\u4e0e\u4e3b\u89c2\u611f\u77e5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u5f02\u5728\u5168\u7403\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u548c\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u611f\u77e5\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u5927\uff1b\u5c45\u4f4f\u5730\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u611f\u77e5\u7eff\u610f\u7684\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u6587\u5316\u3001\u73af\u5883\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u56e0\u7d20\u5728\u5851\u9020\u57ce\u5e02\u7eff\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u57ce\u5e02\u7eff\u5316\u5bf9\u6c14\u5019\u548c\u5c45\u6c11\u798f\u7949\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5ba2\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0e\u4e3b\u89c2\u611f\u77e5\u4e4b\u95f4\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u9700\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8857\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6db5\u76d6\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8de8\u56fd\u5bb6\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5ba2\u89c2\u7eff\u91cf\uff08\u5982GVI\uff09\u4e0e\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u5206\uff08\u5982\u6210\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4ef7\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u4eba\u7c7b\u3001\u5730\u7406\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5168\u7403\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u5ba2\u89c2\u4e0e\u4e3b\u89c2\u7eff\u91cf\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\uff1b\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u611f\u77e5\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\uff1b\u5c45\u4f4f\u5730\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u611f\u77e5\u7eff\u610f\u7684\u6700\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6587\u5316\u3001\u73af\u5883\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u56e0\u7d20\u663e\u8457\u5851\u9020\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u57ce\u5e02\u7eff\u5316\u7684\u770b\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c45\u4f4f\u5730\u5728\u51b3\u5b9a\u4eba\u4eec\u5982\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u57ce\u5e02\u7eff\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u8d77\u7740\u6838\u5fc3\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6587\u5316\u3001\u73af\u5883\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u80cc\u666f\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u7eff\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a contextual biasing method for attention based encoder decoder (AED) models using a list of candidate named entities. Instead of predicting only the next token, we simultaneously predict multiple future tokens, enabling the model to \"peek into the future\" and score potential candidate entities in the entity list. Moreover, our approach leverages the multi-token prediction logits directly without requiring additional entity encoders or cross-attention layers, significantly reducing architectural complexity.

These two recent algorithmic approaches improve the performance of base optimizers, such as AdamW, through different iterate averaging strategies. Schedule-Free explicitly maintains a uniform average of past weights, while single-worker DiLoCo performs implicit averaging by periodically aggregating trajectories, called pseudo-gradients, to update the model parameters. However, single-worker DiLoCo's periodic averaging introduces a two-loop structure, increasing its memory requirements and number of hyperparameters. GPA overcomes these limitations by decoupling the interpolation constant in the primal averaging formulation of Nesterov. This decoupling enables GPA to smoothly average iterates at every step, generalizing and improving upon single-worker DiLoCo. Empirically, GPA consistently outperforms single-worker DiLoCo while removing the two-loop structure, simplifying hyperparameter tuning, and reducing its memory overhead to a single additional buffer. On the Llama-160M model, GPA provides a 24.22% speedup in terms of steps to reach the baseline (AdamW's) validation loss. Likewise, GPA achieves speedups of 12% and 27% on small and large batch setups, respectively, to attain AdamW's validation accuracy on the ImageNet ViT workload. Furthermore, we prove that for any base optimizer with regret bounded by $O(\\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the number of iterations, GPA can match or exceed the convergence guarantee of the original optimizer, depending on the choice of interpolation constants.", "AI": {"tldr": "GPA \u662f Nesterov \u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u539f\u59cb\u5e73\u5747\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0a\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fd1\u671f\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e73\u5747\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff08\u5982\u5355\u5de5\u4f5c\u8282\u70b9 DiLoCo \u548c Schedule-Free\uff09\u5728\u975e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u539f\u59cb\u5e73\u5747\u4e2d\u7684\u63d2\u503c\u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fed\u4ee3\u5e73\u5747\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u907f\u514d\u4e86 DiLoCo \u7684\u53cc\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cGPA \u5728 Llama-160M \u4e0a\u6bd4 AdamW \u5feb 24.22%\uff0c\u5728 ImageNet ViT \u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5206\u522b\u5728\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u548c\u5927\u6279\u91cf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347 12% \u548c 27% \u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u540e\u6094\u754c\u4e3a $O(\\sqrt{T})$ \u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0cGPA \u80fd\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u539f\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e73\u5747\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff08\u5982 DiLoCo \u548c Schedule-Free\uff09\u5728\u975e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53cc\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u6784\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u9ad8\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u3001\u590d\u6742\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u4ee5\u53ca\u5468\u671f\u6027\u5e73\u5747\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Generalized Primal Averaging (GPA)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026 Nesterov \u539f\u59cb\u5e73\u5747\u516c\u5f0f\u4e2d\u7684\u63d2\u503c\u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6bcf\u6b65\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fed\u4ee3\u5e73\u5747\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u539f\u6709\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u6216\u663e\u5f0f\u5e73\u5747\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u57fa\u7840\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "result": "GPA \u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u5de5\u4f5c\u8282\u70b9 DiLoCo\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff1a\u5728 Llama-160M \u4e0a\u63d0\u5347 24.22%\uff0c\u5728 ImageNet ViT \u5c0f/\u5927\u6279\u91cf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347 12% \u548c 27%\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u81f3\u4ec5\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u989d\u5916\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u7684\u53cc\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "GPA \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7b80\u6d01\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u63d2\u503c\u5e38\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u5e73\u5747\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3002"}}

The task of relative pose estimation using visual and inertial information has important applications in various fields. To improve the accuracy of relative pose estimation of multi-camera systems, we propose a globally optimal solver using affine correspondences to estimate the generalized relative pose with a known vertical direction. First, a cost function about the relative rotation angle is established after decoupling the rotation matrix and translation vector, which minimizes the algebraic error of geometric constraints from affine correspondences. Then, the global optimization problem is converted into two polynomials with two unknowns based on the characteristic equation and its first derivative is zero. Finally, the relative rotation angle can be solved using the polynomial eigenvalue solver, and the translation vector can be obtained from the eigenvector. Besides, a new linear solution is proposed when the relative rotation is small. The proposed solver is evaluated on synthetic data and real-world datasets. The experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods in accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eff\u5c04\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u5782\u76f4\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f30\u8ba1\u591a\u76f8\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u59ff\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u65cb\u8f6c\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u5e73\u79fb\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5173\u4e8e\u76f8\u5bf9\u65cb\u8f6c\u89d2\u7684\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4eff\u5c04\u5bf9\u5e94\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee3\u6570\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\u5c06\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u672a\u77e5\u6570\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6c42\u89e3\u76f8\u5bf9\u65cb\u8f6c\u89d2\uff0c\u5e73\u79fb\u5411\u91cf\u5219\u7531\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\u83b7\u5f97\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5c0f\u76f8\u5bf9\u65cb\u8f6c\u60c5\u51b5\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u89e3\u6cd5\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u76f8\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u60ef\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6c7d\u8f66\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5bf9\u65cb\u8f6c\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u5e73\u79fb\u5411\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eff\u5c04\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u8bef\u5dee\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u7a0b\u53ca\u5176\u4e00\u9636\u5bfc\u6570\u4e3a\u96f6\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5c06\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u672a\u77e5\u6570\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6c42\u89e3\u76f8\u5bf9\u65cb\u8f6c\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u5e73\u79fb\u5411\u91cf\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u65cb\u8f6c\u89d2\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u89e3\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eff\u5c04\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u76f8\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u5782\u76f4\u65b9\u5411\u4e0b\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9-\u60ef\u6027\u878d\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, their reliability is hindered by hallucinations, where models often fail to derive answers from visual evidence, instead relying on learned textual priors. Existing mitigation strategies for MedVLMs have distinct limitations: training-based methods rely on costly expert annotations, limiting scalability, while training-free interventions like contrastive decoding, though data-efficient, apply a global, untargeted correction whose effects in complex real-world clinical settings can be unreliable. To address these challenges, we introduce Anatomical Region-Guided Contrastive Decoding (ARCD), a plug-and-play strategy that mitigates hallucinations by providing targeted, region-specific guidance. Our module leverages an anatomical mask to direct a three-tiered contrastive decoding process. By dynamically re-weighting at the token, attention, and logits levels, it verifiably steers the model's focus onto specified regions, reinforcing anatomical understanding and suppressing factually incorrect outputs.

This makes evaluating UGC translation particularly challenging: what counts as a \"good\" translation depends on the level of standardness desired in the output. To explore this, we examine the human translation guidelines of four UGC datasets, and derive a taxonomy of twelve non-standard phenomena and five translation actions (NORMALISE, COPY, TRANSFER, OMIT, CENSOR). Our analysis reveals notable differences in how UGC is treated, resulting in a spectrum of standardness in reference translations. Through a case study on large language models (LLMs), we show that translation scores are highly sensitive to prompts with explicit translation instructions for UGC, and that they improve when these align with the dataset's guidelines. We argue that when preserving UGC style is important, fair evaluation requires both models and metrics to be aware of translation guidelines. Finally, we call for clear guidelines during dataset creation and for the development of controllable, guideline-aware evaluation frameworks for UGC translation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\uff08UGC\uff09\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u8bed\u8a00\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b12\u79cd\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u7279\u5f81\u548c5\u79cd\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7b56\u7565\uff08NORMALISE\u3001COPY\u3001TRANSFER\u3001OMIT\u3001CENSOR\uff09\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9UGC\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u53c2\u8003\u8bd1\u6587\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5448\u73b0\u8c31\u7cfb\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8bc4\u5206\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u5305\u542b\u660e\u786e\u7684UGC\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6307\u5357\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u7559UGC\u98ce\u683c\u91cd\u8981\u65f6\uff0c\u516c\u5e73\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u786e\u4fdd\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u9075\u5faa\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u521b\u5efa\u9636\u6bb5\u5236\u5b9a\u6e05\u6670\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u6307\u5357\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7528\u6237\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\uff08UGC\uff09\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u8bed\u8a00\u5f62\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u62fc\u5199\u9519\u8bef\u3001\u4fda\u8bed\u3001\u5b57\u7b26\u91cd\u590d\u3001\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u53f7\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5176\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8bc4\u4f30\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u4f55\u4e3a\u2018\u597d\u2019\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u8f93\u51fa\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6307\u5357\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u56db\u4e2aUGC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u5f52\u7eb3\u51fa12\u7c7b\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u73b0\u8c61\u4e0e5\u79cd\u7ffb\u8bd1\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u68c0\u9a8c\u6307\u5357\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5bf9\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9UGC\u7684\u5904\u7406\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53c2\u8003\u8bd1\u6587\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5f62\u6210\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u7cfb\uff1b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8bc4\u5206\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u5305\u542b\u660e\u786e\u6307\u4ee4\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6307\u5357\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u4fdd\u7559UGC\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u516c\u5e73\u8bc4\u4f30\u5fc5\u987b\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5177\u5907\u5bf9\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6307\u5357\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u63a8\u52a8\u5efa\u7acb\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u521b\u5efa\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5c55\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u6307\u5357\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Bump-PINNs are trained using the same collocation-based approach used by PINNs, Bump-EDNN uses a BumpNet only in the spatial domain and uses EDNNs to advance the solution in time, while Bump-DeepONets employ a BumpNet regression network as the trunk network of a DeepONet.

This paper proposes Reasoning Palette, a novel latent-modulation framework that endows the model with a stochastic latent variable for strategic contextualization, guiding its internal planning prior to token generation. This latent context is inferred from the mean-pooled embedding of a question-answer pair via a variational autoencoder (VAE), where each sampled latent potentially encodes a distinct reasoning context. During inference, a sampled latent is decoded into learnable token prefixes and prepended to the input prompt, modulating the model's internal reasoning trajectory. In this way, the model performs internal sampling over reasoning strategies prior to output generation, which shapes the style and structure of the entire response sequence. A brief supervised fine-tuning (SFT) warm-up phase allows the model to adapt to this latent conditioning. Within RL optimization, Reasoning Palette facilitates structured exploration by enabling on-demand injection for diverse reasoning modes, significantly enhancing exploration efficiency and sustained learning capability. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method enables interpretable and controllable control over the (vision-) language model's strategic behavior, thereby achieving consistent performance gains over standard RL methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faReasoning Palette\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08VAE\uff09\u4ece\u95ee\u9898-\u7b54\u6848\u5bf9\u7684\u5747\u503c\u6c60\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u51fa\u968f\u673a\u6f5c\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u89e3\u7801\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8f93\u51fa\u524d\u8fdb\u884c\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u91c7\u6837\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5e38\u56e0\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u5bfc\u81f4\u5197\u4f59\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u5c42\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u6765\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u524d\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08VAE\uff09\u4ece\u95ee\u9898-\u7b54\u6848\u5bf9\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u91c7\u6837\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u540e\u89e3\u7801\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u6ce8\u5165\u5230\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\uff0c\u8c03\u8282\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u7b80\u77ed\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u70ed\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u8be5\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u6309\u9700\u6ce8\u5165\u4e0d\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cReasoning Palette \u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u4f18\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "Reasoning Palette \u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

The rapid development of large language models needs benchmarks that can evaluate their comprehension of ancient characters. Existing Chinese benchmarks are mostly targeted at modern Chinese and transmitted documents in ancient Chinese, but the part of excavated documents in ancient Chinese is not covered. To meet this need, we propose the AncientBench, which aims to evaluate the comprehension of ancient characters, especially in the scenario of excavated documents. The AncientBench is divided into four dimensions, which correspond to the four competencies of ancient character comprehension: glyph comprehension, pronunciation comprehension, meaning comprehension, and contextual comprehension. The benchmark also contains ten tasks, including radical, phonetic radical, homophone, cloze, translation, and more, providing a comprehensive framework for evaluation. We convened archaeological researchers to conduct experimental evaluations, proposed an ancient model as baseline, and conducted extensive experiments on the currently best-performing large language models. The experimental results reveal the great potential of large language models in ancient textual scenarios as well as the gap with humans.

As a result, predicting EV charging demand has become a timely and important research problem. While substantial research has addressed energy load forecasting in transportation, relatively few studies systematically compare multiple forecasting methods across different temporal horizons and spatial aggregation levels in diverse urban settings. This work investigates the effectiveness of five time series forecasting models, ranging from traditional statistical approaches to machine learning and deep learning methods. Forecasting performance is evaluated for short-, mid-, and long-term horizons (on the order of minutes, hours, and days, respectively), and across spatial scales ranging from individual charging stations to regional and city-level aggregations.

While reinforcement learning methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) offer a low-cost alignment solution, their reliance on sparse, outcome-based rewards inadvertently encourages models to \"overthink\" -- generating verbose, convoluted, and unverifiable Chain-of-Thought reasoning to justify answers. This focus on outcomes obscures factual errors and poses significant safety risks. To address this, we propose CheXPO-v2, a novel alignment framework that shifts from outcome to process supervision. Our core innovation is a Knowledge Graph Consistency Reward mechanism driven by Entity-Relation Matching. By explicitly parsing reasoning steps into structured \"Disease, Relation, Anatomy\" triplets, we provide fine-grained supervision that penalizes incoherent logic and hallucinations at the atomic level. Integrating this with a hard-example mining strategy, our approach significantly outperforms GRPO and state-of-the-art models on benchmarks like MIMIC-CXR-VQA. Crucially, CheXPO-v2 achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy using only 5k samples, demonstrating exceptional data efficiency while producing clinically sound and verifiable reasoning.

Nowadays, MedER-based research outcomes can remarkably contribute to the development of automated systems in the medical sector, ultimately enhancing patient care and outcomes. While extensive research has been conducted on MedER in English, low-resource languages like Bangla remain underexplored. Our work aims to bridge this gap. For Bangla medical entity recognition, this study first examined a number of transformer models, including BERT, DistilBERT, ELECTRA, and RoBERTa. We also propose a novel Multi-BERT Ensemble approach that outperformed all baseline models with the highest accuracy of 89.58%. Notably, it provides an 11.80% accuracy improvement over the single-layer BERT model, demonstrating its effectiveness for this task. A major challenge in MedER for low-resource languages is the lack of annotated datasets. To address this issue, we developed a high-quality dataset tailored for the Bangla MedER task. The dataset was used to evaluate the effectiveness of our model through multiple performance metrics, demonstrating its robustness and applicability.

However, significant discrepancies in band composition and spatial resolution across different optical sensors present major challenges for existing Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). These models are typically pretrained on fixed band configurations and resolutions, making them vulnerable to real world scenarios involving missing bands, cross sensor fusion, and unseen spatial scales, thereby limiting their generalization and practical deployment. To address these limitations, we propose Any Optical Model (AOM), a universal RSFM explicitly designed to accommodate arbitrary band compositions, sensor types, and resolution scales. To preserve distinctive spectral characteristics even when bands are missing or newly introduced, AOM introduces a spectrum-independent tokenizer that assigns each channel a dedicated band embedding, enabling explicit encoding of spectral identity. To effectively capture texture and contextual patterns from sub-meter to hundred-meter imagery, we design a multi-scale adaptive patch embedding mechanism that dynamically modulates the receptive field. Furthermore, to maintain global semantic consistency across varying resolutions, AOM incorporates a multi-scale semantic alignment mechanism alongside a channel-wise self-supervised masking and reconstruction pretraining strategy that jointly models spectral-spatial relationships. Extensive experiments on over 10 public datasets, including those from Sentinel-2, Landsat, and HLS, demonstrate that AOM consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance under challenging conditions such as band missing, cross sensor, and cross resolution settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAny Optical Model\uff08AOM\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u610f\u6ce2\u6bb5\u7ec4\u5408\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u901a\u7528\u9065\u611f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8c31\u65e0\u5173\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u4fdd\u7559\u5149\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5757\u5d4c\u5165\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u540c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u901a\u9053\u7ea7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u63a9\u7801\u91cd\u5efa\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3001\u8de8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5728\u8d85\u8fc710\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cAOM\u5728\u7f3a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u3001\u8de8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3001\u8de8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u6027\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9065\u611f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08RSFMs\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u7f3a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u3001\u8de8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8c31\u65e0\u5173\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u901a\u9053\u5206\u914d\u4e13\u5c5e\u6ce2\u6bb5\u5d4c\u5165\u4ee5\u663e\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u5149\u8c31\u8eab\u4efd\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5757\u5d4c\u5165\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u901a\u9053\u7ea7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u63a9\u7801\u91cd\u5efa\u7b56\u7565\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u5149\u8c31-\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8d85\u8fc710\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5982Sentinel-2\u3001Landsat\u3001HLS\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cAOM\u5728\u7f3a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u3001\u8de8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3001\u8de8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u53d6\u5f97\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f73\uff08SOTA\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "AOM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9996\u4e2a\u771f\u6b63\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5149\u5b66\u9065\u611f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9065\u611f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u590d\u6742\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we present ShareChat, a large-scale, cross-platform corpus comprising 142,808 conversations and over 660,000 turns collected from publicly shared URLs across five major platforms: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, and Grok. ShareChat distinguishes itself by preserving native platform affordances often lost in standard logs, including reasoning traces, source links, and code artifacts, while spanning 101 languages over the period from April 2023 to October 2025. Furthermore, ShareChat offers substantially longer context windows and greater interaction depth than prior datasets. We demonstrate the dataset's multifaceted utility through three representative analyses: (1) analyzing conversation completeness to measure user intent satisfaction; (2) evaluating source citation behaviors in content generation; and (3) conducting temporal analysis to track evolving usage patterns.

This degradation can be attributed to distribution shifts, including user, character, and dialogue compositional shifts. Existing methods like LLM-as-a-judge fall short in providing a fine-grained diagnosis of how these shifts affect RPM generalization, and thus there lack formal frameworks to characterize RPM generalization behaviors. To bridge these gaps, we introduce an information-theoretic metric, named reasoning-based effective mutual information difference (R-EMID), to measure RPM performance degradation in an interpretable way. We also derive an upper bound on R-EMID to predict the worst-case generalization performance of RPMs and theoretically reveal how various shifts contribute to the RPM performance degradation. Moreover, we propose a co-evolving reinforcement learning framework to adaptively model the connection among user, character, and dialogue context and thus enhance the estimation of dialogue response generation probability, which is critical for calculating R-EMID. Finally, we evaluate the generalization performance of various RPMs using R-EMID, finding that user shift poses the highest risk among all shifts and reinforcement learning is the most effective approach for enhancing RPM generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u5dee\u5f02\uff08R-EMID\uff09\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ee5\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8861\u91cf\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u6a21\u578b\uff08RPMs\uff09\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u5bfcR-EMID\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u3001\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7ec4\u5408\u7b49\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u5bf9RPM\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u3001\u89d2\u8272\u4e0e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u8bdd\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u6982\u7387\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301R-EMID\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u504f\u79fb\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u6700\u5927\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u800c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982LLM-as-a-judge\u65e0\u6cd5\u5bf9\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u523b\u753b\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u7406\u8bba\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faR-EMID\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u5206\u6790\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u3001\u89d2\u8272\u4e0e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u6982\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86R-EMID\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7528\u6237\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u5bf9RPM\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5927\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "R-EMID\u4e3a\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5404\u7c7b\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We propose an aggregator module that learns global descriptors consistent with both geometrical structure and visual similarity, ensuring that images are close in descriptor space only when they are visually similar and spatially connected. This corrects erroneous associations caused by unreliable overlap scores. Using a batch-mining strategy based solely on the overlap scores and a modified contrastive loss, our method trains without manual place labels and generalizes across diverse environments. Experiments on challenging benchmarks show substantial localization gains in large-scale environments while preserving computational and memory efficiency.

A critical failure mode is \"visual forgetting\", where models progressively lose visual grounding as reasoning extends, a phenomenon aptly described as \"think longer, see less\". We posit this failure stems from current training paradigms prematurely entangling two distinct cognitive skills: (1) abstract logical reasoning \"how-to-think\") and (2) strategic visual perception (\"when-to-look\"). This creates a foundational cold-start deficiency -- weakening abstract reasoning -- and a strategic perception deficit, as models lack a policy for when to perceive. In this paper, we propose a novel curriculum-based framework to disentangle these skills. First, we introduce a disentangled Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) curriculum that builds a robust abstract reasoning backbone on text-only data before anchoring it to vision with a novel Perception-Grounded Chain-of-Thought (PG-CoT) paradigm. Second, we resolve the strategic perception deficit by formulating timing as a reinforcement learning problem. We design a Pivotal Perception Reward that teaches the model when to look by coupling perceptual actions to linguistic markers of cognitive uncertainty (e.g., \"wait\", \"verify\"), thereby learning an autonomous grounding policy. Our contributions include the formalization of these two deficiencies and the development of a principled, two-stage framework to address them, transforming the model from a heuristic-driven observer to a strategic, grounded reasoner. \\textbf{Code}: \\url{https://github.com/gaozilve-max/learning-when-to-look}.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u56e0\u201c\u89c6\u89c9\u9057\u5fd8\u201d\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u62bd\u8c61\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u4e24\u79cd\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u5728\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6784\u5efa\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u518d\u5f15\u5165\u611f\u77e5\u951a\u5b9a\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08PG-CoT\uff09\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\u5c06\u611f\u77e5\u65f6\u673a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5173\u952e\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4f1a\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u65f6\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f55\u65f6\u89c2\u5bdf\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a5\u5730\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6301\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a71\u52a8\u5230\u7b56\u7565\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u94fe\u6761\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u2018\u89c6\u89c9\u9057\u5fd8\u2019\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5373\u968f\u7740\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5ef6\u957f\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9010\u6e10\u5931\u53bb\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u8fd9\u6e90\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u8fc7\u65e9\u5730\u5c06\u62bd\u8c61\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u2018\u4f55\u65f6\u770b\u2019\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u957f\u671f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff1a(1) \u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u5efa\u7acb\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1b(2) \u518d\u5f15\u5165\u611f\u77e5\u951a\u5b9a\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08PG-CoT\uff09\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u9010\u6b65\u878d\u5165\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u611f\u77e5\u65f6\u673a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\uff08\u5982'wait', 'verify'\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5173\u952e\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u3001\u957f\u94fe\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a5\u5730\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3b\u5224\u65ad\u4f55\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u67e5\u770b\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u88ab\u52a8\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u5927\u7f3a\u9677\u2014\u2014\u57fa\u7840\u63a8\u7406\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e0e\u6218\u7565\u611f\u77e5\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u4e0e\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u5411\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u5411\u6f14\u8fdb\u3002"}}

While existing methods attempt to address these issues by reducing visual tokens or extending model's context length, they may miss useful information or take considerable computation. In fact, when answering given questions, only a small amount of crucial information is required. Therefore, we propose an efficient question-aware memory mechanism, enabling MLLMs to recurrently seek these critical clues. Our approach, named VideoDetective, simplifies this task by iteratively processing video sub-segments. For each sub-segment, a question-aware compression strategy is employed by introducing a few special memory tokens to achieve purposefully compression. This allows models to effectively seek critical clues while reducing visual tokens. Then, due to history context could have a significant impact, we recurrently aggregate and store these memory tokens to update history context, which would be reused for subsequent sub-segments. Furthermore, to more effectively measure model's long video understanding ability, we introduce GLVC (Grounding Long Video Clues), a long video question-answering dataset, which features grounding critical and concrete clues scattered throughout entire videos. Experimental results demonstrate our method enables MLLMs with limited context length of 32K to efficiently process 100K tokens (3600 frames, an hour-long video sampled at 1fps), requiring only 2 minutes and 37GB GPU memory usage. Evaluation results across multiple long video benchmarks illustrate our method can more effectively seek critical clues from massive information.", "AI": {"tldr": "VideoDetective\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u611f\u77e5\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u9891\u5b50\u6bb5\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7279\u6b8a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4ee4\u724c\u5b9e\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u805a\u5408\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4ee4\u724c\u6765\u66f4\u65b0\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6GLVC\u4ee5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5173\u952e\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u572832K\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u957f\u8fbe1\u5c0f\u65f6\uff083600\u5e27\uff09\u7684\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u4ec5\u97002\u5206\u949f\u548c37GB GPU\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u9762\u4e34\u6d77\u91cf\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u8f7d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6216\u4e22\u5931\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6216\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\u53ea\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVideoDetective\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u611f\u77e5\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u5b50\u6bb5\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u7279\u6b8a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4ee4\u724c\u8fdb\u884c\u538b\u7f29\uff1b\u9012\u5f52\u805a\u5408\u5e76\u5b58\u50a8\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4ee4\u724c\u4ee5\u66f4\u65b0\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3002", "result": "\u572832K\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u6210\u529f\u5904\u74063600\u5e27\uff081\u5c0f\u65f6\uff09\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u4ec5\u75282\u5206\u949f\u548c37GB GPU\u5185\u5b58\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ebf\u7d22\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "VideoDetective\u901a\u8fc7\u95ee\u9898\u611f\u77e5\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7cbe\u51c6\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We present Mitty, a Diffusion Transformer that enables video In-Context Learning for end-to-end Human2Robot video generation. Built on a pretrained video diffusion model, Mitty leverages strong visual-temporal priors to translate human demonstrations into robot-execution videos without action labels or intermediate abstractions. Demonstration videos are compressed into condition tokens and fused with robot denoising tokens through bidirectional attention during diffusion. To mitigate paired-data scarcity, we also develop an automatic synthesis pipeline that produces high-quality human-robot pairs from large egocentric datasets.

However, there is not a consistent definition or test to demonstrate inherent explainability. Work to date either characterises explainability through metrics, or appeals to intuition - \"we know it when we see it\". We propose a globally applicable criterion for inherent explainability. The criterion uses graph theory for representing and decomposing models for structure-local explanation, and recomposing them into global explanations. We form the structure-local explanations as annotations, a verifiable hypothesis-evidence structure that allows for a range of explanatory methods to be used. This criterion matches existing intuitions on inherent explainability, and provides justifications why a large regression model may not be explainable but a sparse neural network could be. We differentiate explainable -- a model that allows for explanation -- and \\textit{explained} -- one that has a verified explanation. Finally, we provide a full explanation of PREDICT -- a Cox proportional hazards model of cardiovascular disease risk, which is in active clinical use in New Zealand. It follows that PREDICT is inherently explainable.

We propose AnyCXR, a unified framework that enables generalizable multi-organ segmentation across arbitrary CXR projection angles using only synthetic supervision. The method combines a Multi-stage Domain Randomization (MSDR) engine, which generates over 100,000 anatomically faithful and highly diverse synthetic radiographs from 3D CT volumes, with a Conditional Joint Annotation Regularization (CAR) learning strategy that leverages partial and imperfect labels by enforcing anatomical consistency in a latent space. Trained entirely on synthetic data, AnyCXR achieves strong zero-shot generalization on multiple real-world datasets, providing accurate delineation of 54 anatomical structures in PA, lateral, and oblique views. The resulting segmentation maps support downstream clinical tasks, including automated cardiothoracic ratio estimation, spine curvature assessment, and disease classification, where the incorporation of anatomical priors improves diagnostic performance.

Through activation patching experiments across 9 models from 7 Transformer families plus Mamba (370M-13B parameters), we establish three key findings:\n  1. Double dissociation: Task Schema transfers at 100% via late MLP patching; Binding transfers at 62% via residual stream patching -- proving separable mechanisms\n  2. Prior-Schema trade-off: Schema reliance inversely correlates with prior knowledge (Spearman rho = -0.596, p < 0.001, N=28 task-model pairs)\n  3. Architecture generality: The mechanism operates across all tested architectures including the non-Transformer Mamba\n  These findings offer a mechanistic account of the ICL puzzle that contrasts with prior views treating ICL as a monolithic mechanism (whether retrieval-based, gradient descent-like, or purely Bayesian). By establishing that Schema and Binding are neurally dissociable -- not merely behavioral modes -- we provide causal evidence for dual-process theories of ICL. Models rely on Task Schema when prior knowledge is absent, but prior knowledge interferes through attentional mis-routing (72.7% recency bias) rather than direct output competition (0%). This explains why arbitrary mappings succeed (zero prior leads to full Schema reliance) while factual overrides fail -- and reveals that the true bottleneck is attentional, not output-level. Practical implications: Understanding these dual mechanisms enables more efficient prompt engineering -- reliable schema transfer reduces required demonstrations for novel tasks, while prior-aware design can mitigate the 38% binding failure rate in high-prior scenarios, improving ICL system reliability in production deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4fee\u8865\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICL\uff09\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u62bd\u8c61\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\uff09\u548c\u7ed1\u5b9a\uff08\u7279\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165-\u8f93\u51fa\u5173\u8054\uff09\u3002\u57289\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\uff087\u4e2aTransformer\u5bb6\u65cf\u53caMamba\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u91cf370M-13B\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u5173\u952e\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u53cc\u5206\u79bb\u73b0\u8c61\u2014\u2014\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u665a\u671fMLP\u4fee\u8865100%\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u7ed1\u5b9a\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u4fee\u8865\u4f20\u901262%\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u5206\uff1b2\uff09\u5148\u9a8c-\u6a21\u5f0f\u6743\u8861\u2014\u2014\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5448\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff08Spearman rho = -0.596, p < 0.001, N=28\uff09\uff1b3\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u666e\u9002\u6027\u2014\u2014\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5747\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u975eTransformer\u7684Mamba\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5c06ICL\u89c6\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6301\u53cc\u91cd\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9519\u4f4d\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u800c\u975e\u8f93\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u3002\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e0a\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u6b64\u53cc\u673a\u5236\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICL\uff09\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u5c06\u5176\u89c6\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5982\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u7c7b\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u6216\u7eaf\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5185\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u89e3\u6790\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793aICL\u662f\u5426\u7531\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u5b50\u673a\u5236\u6784\u6210\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5176\u5185\u5728\u8fd0\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u4e4b\u8c1c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4fee\u8865\uff08activation patching\uff09\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u57289\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\uff087\u4e2aTransformer\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e0eMamba\uff09\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u7ed1\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u4e0e\u4f20\u9012\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u665a\u5c42MLP\u4e0e\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u4fee\u8865\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e24\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u5bdf\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u53cc\u5206\u79bb\u73b0\u8c61\u6210\u7acb\uff1a\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u5f0f100%\u901a\u8fc7\u665a\u671fMLP\u4fee\u8865\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u7ed1\u5b9a62%\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u4fee\u8865\u8f6c\u79fb\uff1b2\uff09\u5148\u9a8c-\u6a21\u5f0f\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u663e\u8457\uff08rho = -0.596, p < 0.001\uff09\uff1b3\uff09\u673a\u5236\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u666e\u9002\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u975eTransformer\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982Mamba\uff09\u3002\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9519\u4f4d\u5bfc\u81f472.7%\u7684\u8fd1\u671f\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u8f93\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e3a\u96f6\u3002", "conclusion": "ICL\u5e76\u975e\u5355\u4e00\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u7531\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u7ed1\u5b9a\u4e24\u4e2a\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5236\u6784\u6210\u3002\u5f53\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5b8c\u5168\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9519\u4f4d\u5e72\u6270\u800c\u975e\u76f4\u63a5\u8f93\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u3002\u8fd9\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4e3a\u4f55\u4efb\u610f\u6620\u5c04\u6709\u6548\u800c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8986\u76d6\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u4e14\u6838\u5fc3\u74f6\u9888\u5728\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u9762\u3002\u8be5\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2dICL\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

We show that these judge systems exhibit a recurring vulnerability: short sequences of low-perplexity control tokens can flip many binary evaluations from correct ``No'' judgments to incorrect ``Yes'' judgments by steering the last-layer logit gap. These control tokens are patterns that a policy model could plausibly generate during post-training, and thus represent realistic reward-hacking risks rather than worst-case adversarial strings. Our method, AdvJudge-Zero, uses the model's next-token distribution and beam-search exploration to discover diverse control-token sequences from scratch, and our analysis shows that the induced hidden-state perturbations concentrate in a low-rank ``soft mode'' that is anti-aligned with the judge's refusal direction. Empirically, these tokens cause very high false positive rates when large open-weight and specialized judge models score incorrect answers on math and reasoning benchmarks. Finally, we show that LoRA-based adversarial training on small sets of control-token-augmented examples can markedly reduce these false positives while preserving evaluation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u5224\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982RLHF\u3001DPO\u7b49\uff09\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u4f4e\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u4ee4\u724c\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u53ef\u8f7b\u6613\u8bef\u5bfc\u8bc4\u5224\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u6b63\u786e\u5224\u65ad\u4e3a'\u5426'\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u9519\u8bef\u5730\u5224\u5b9a\u4e3a'\u662f'\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63a7\u5236\u4ee4\u724c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\uff0c\u4ee3\u8868\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u52ab\u6301\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faAdvJudge-Zero\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bcd\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u675f\u641c\u7d22\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4ece\u96f6\u5f00\u59cb\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u4ee4\u724c\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ee4\u724c\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u6270\u52a8\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0e\u62d2\u7edd\u65b9\u5411\u53cd\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9'\u8f6f\u6a21\u5f0f'\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u578b\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cd\u53ca\u4e13\u7528\u8bc4\u5224\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u5047\u9633\u6027\u7387\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u4ee4\u724c\u589e\u5f3a\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884cLoRA\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5047\u9633\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bc4\u4f30\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u548cLLM-as-a-Judge\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u9690\u853d\u63a7\u5236\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u8ba4\u8bc6\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u4e00\u79cd\u73b0\u5b9e\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u52ab\u6301\u653b\u51fb\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5373\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u751f\u6210\u7684\u77ed\u5e8f\u5217\u63a7\u5236\u4ee4\u724c\u64cd\u7eb5\u8bc4\u5224\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAdvJudge-Zero\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bcd\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u675f\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bf1\u5bfc\u9519\u8bef\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u4ee4\u724c\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4f4e\u79e9\u4e14\u53cd\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u2018\u8f6f\u6a21\u5f0f\u2019\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u91c7\u7528LoRA\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u4ee4\u724c\u53ef\u4f7f\u591a\u79cd\u5927\u578b\u8bc4\u5224\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u6781\u9ad8\u5047\u9633\u6027\u7387\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u63a7\u5236\u4ee4\u724c\u589e\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884cLoRA\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u5224\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u539f\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u5224\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u53ef\u81ea\u7136\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u4ee4\u724c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Enhancing adversarial robustness is therefore essential, requiring detectors that can defend against diverse attacks (generalizability) while maintaining high overall accuracy. However, simultaneously achieving both optimal generalizability and accuracy is challenging. Following the computational design science paradigm, this study takes a sequential approach that first proposes a novel framework (Large Language Model-based Sample Generation and Aggregation, LLM-SGA) by identifying the key invariances of textual adversarial attacks and leveraging them to ensure that a detector instantiated within the framework has strong generalizability. Second, we instantiate our detector (Adversarially Robust Harmful Online Content Detector, ARHOCD) with three novel design components to improve detection accuracy: (1) an ensemble of multiple base detectors that exploits their complementary strengths; (2) a novel weight assignment method that dynamically adjusts weights based on each sample's predictability and each base detector's capability, with weights initialized using domain knowledge and updated via Bayesian inference; and (3) a novel adversarial training strategy that iteratively optimizes both the base detectors and the weight assignor. We addressed several limitations of existing adversarial robustness enhancement research and empirically evaluated ARHOCD across three datasets spanning hate speech, rumor, and extremist content.

However, previous approaches often struggle to effectively leverage both the visual and linguistic knowledge. Recent efforts have attempted to incorporate Vision-language models (VLMs), which excel at aligning visual and textual features, into universal IR. Nevertheless, these methods fail to utilize the linguistic priors to ensure semantic coherence during the restoration process. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose the Vision-Language Model Guided Image Restoration (VLMIR) framework, which leverages the rich vision-language priors of VLMs, such as CLIP, to enhance IR performance through improved visual perception and semantic understanding. Our approach consists of two stages: VLM-based feature extraction and diffusion-based image restoration. In the first stage, we extract complementary visual and linguistic representations of input images by condensing the visual perception and high-level semantic priors through VLMs. Specifically, we align the embeddings of captions from low-quality and high-quality images using a cosine similarity loss with LoRA fine-tuning, and employ a degradation predictor to decompose degradation and clean image content embeddings. These complementary visual and textual embeddings are then integrated into a diffusion-based model via cross-attention mechanisms for enhanced restoration. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that VLMIR achieves superior performance across both universal and degradation-specific IR tasks, underscoring the critical role of integrated visual and linguistic knowledge from VLMs in advancing image restoration capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u6846\u67b6\uff08VLMIR\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u5229\u7528VLM\uff08\u5982CLIP\uff09\u63d0\u53d6\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u4e0eLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f4e\u8d28\u4e0e\u9ad8\u8d28\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u9000\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5206\u79bb\u9000\u5316\u4e0e\u5e72\u51c0\u5185\u5bb9\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5d4c\u5165\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6ce8\u5165\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u4fee\u590d\u3002\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVLMIR\u5728\u901a\u7528\u53ca\u7279\u5b9a\u9000\u5316\u7c7b\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u517c\u987e\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u6765\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4fee\u590d\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6062\u590d\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVLMIR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eVLM\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0eLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f4e\u8d28\u4e0e\u9ad8\u8d28\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u9000\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5206\u89e3\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u9000\u5316\u6210\u5206\uff1b2\uff09\u5c06\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u5d4c\u5165\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u878d\u5165\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4fee\u590d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u9000\u5316\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cVLMIR\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ec6\u8282\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u4e14\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5404\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u96c6\u6210\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u7684VLMIR\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Existing medical VQA datasets are limited in scale, dominated by X-ray imaging or biomedical illustrations, and often prone to text-based shortcuts. RadImageNet-VQA is built from expert-curated annotations and provides 750K images paired with 7.5M question-answer samples. It covers three key tasks - abnormality detection, anatomy recognition, and pathology identification - spanning eight anatomical regions and 97 pathology categories, and supports open-ended, closed-ended, and multiple-choice questions. Extensive experiments show that state-of-the-art vision-language models still struggle with fine-grained pathology identification, particularly in open-ended settings and even after fine-tuning. Text-only analysis further reveals that model performance collapses to near-random without image inputs, confirming that RadImageNet-VQA is free from linguistic shortcuts.

To address these challenges, we present HiSIR-Net, a High resolution, Self-supervised Reconstruction framework for pixel-wise PCBA localization. Our design combines two lightweight modules that make this practical on real 4K-resolution boards: (i) a Selective Input-Reconstruction Gate (SIR-Gate) that lets the model decide where to trust reconstruction versus the original input, thereby reducing irrelevant reconstruction artifacts and false alarms; and (ii) a Region-level Optimized Patch Selection (ROPS) scheme with positional cues to select overlapping patch reconstructions coherently across arbitrary resolutions. Organically integrating these mechanisms yields clean, high-resolution anomaly maps with low false positive (FP) rate. To bridge the gap in high-resolution PCBA datasets, we further contribute a self-collected dataset named SIPCBA-500 of 500 images. We conduct extensive experiments on our SIPCBA-500 as well as public benchmarks, demonstrating the superior localization performance of our method while running at practical speed.

While feature caching offers a promising training-free acceleration solution by exploiting temporal redundancy, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) uniform caching intervals fail to align with the non-uniform temporal dynamics of DiT, and (2) naive feature reuse with excessively large caching intervals can lead to severe error accumulation. In this work, we analyze the evolution of DiT features during denoising and reveal that both feature changes and error propagation are highly time- and depth-varying. Motivated by this, we propose ProCache, a training-free dynamic feature caching framework that addresses these issues via two core components: (i) a constraint-aware caching pattern search module that generates non-uniform activation schedules through offline constrained sampling, tailored to the model's temporal characteristics; and (ii) a selective computation module that selectively computes within deep blocks and high-importance tokens for cached segments to mitigate error accumulation with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments on PixArt-alpha and DiT demonstrate that ProCache achieves up to 1.96x and 2.90x acceleration with negligible quality degradation, significantly outperforming prior caching-based methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "ProCache\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7f13\u5b58\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u5747\u5300\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347Diffusion Transformers\uff08DiTs\uff09\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad82.90\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u9002\u5e94DiT\u4e2d\u975e\u5747\u5300\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u6216\u8bef\u5dee\u79ef\u7d2f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u6a21\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u6a21\u5757\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u975e\u5747\u5300\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u6df1\u5c42\u5757\u548c\u9ad8\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6807\u8bb0\u4e0a\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u7f13\u5b58\u6bb5\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728PixArt-alpha\u548cDiT\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cProCache\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe1.96\u500d\u548c2.90\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e14\u8d28\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u6781\u5c0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ProCache\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7f13\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u7f13\u5b58\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u5747\u4e0e\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3aDiT\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Performing such analyses in a statistically rigorous manner is non-trivial, however. Appropriate performance metrics must be selected that allow for valid comparisons between groups of different sample sizes and base rates; metric uncertainty must be determined and multiple comparisons be corrected for, in order to assess whether any observed differences may be purely due to chance; and in the case of intersectional analyses, mechanisms must be implemented to find the most `interesting' subgroups within combinatorially many subgroup combinations. We here present a statistical toolbox that addresses these challenges and enables practitioners to easily yet rigorously assess their models for potential subgroup performance disparities.

However, most prior benchmarks rely on low-resolution imagery, and some high-resolution benchmarks suffer from flawed reasoning-task designs. We show that text-only LLMs can perform competitively with multimodal vision-language models on RS reasoning tasks without access to images, revealing a critical mismatch between current benchmarks and the intended evaluation of visual understanding. To enable faithful assessment, we introduce RSHR-Bench, a super-high-resolution benchmark for RS visual understanding and reasoning. RSHR-Bench contains 5,329 full-scene images with a long side of at least 4,000 pixels, with up to about 3 x 10^8 pixels per image, sourced from widely used RS corpora and UAV collections. We design four task families: multiple-choice VQA, open-ended VQA, image captioning, and single-image evaluation. These tasks cover nine perception categories and four reasoning types, supporting multi-turn and multi-image dialog. To reduce reliance on language priors, we apply adversarial filtering with strong LLMs followed by rigorous human verification. Overall, we construct 3,864 VQA tasks, 3,913 image captioning tasks, and 500 fully human-written or verified single-image evaluation VQA pairs. Evaluations across open-source, closed-source, and RS-specific VLMs reveal persistent performance gaps in super-high-resolution scenarios.

Long-term electricity market mechanisms, including auctions, support schemes, and other policy instruments, are critical in shaping the electricity generation mix. In light of the need for more advanced tools to support policymakers and other stakeholders in designing, testing, and evaluating long-term markets, this work presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning model capable of capturing the key features of decarbonizing energy systems. Profit-maximizing generation companies make investment decisions in the wholesale electricity market, responding to system needs, competitive dynamics, and policy signals. The model employs independent proximal policy optimization, which was selected for suitability to the decentralized and competitive environment. Nevertheless, given the inherent challenges of independent learning in multi-agent settings, an extensive hyperparameter search ensures that decentralized training yields market outcomes consistent with competitive behavior. The model is applied to a stylized version of the Italian electricity system and tested under varying levels of competition, market designs, and policy scenarios. Results highlight the critical role of market design for decarbonizing the electricity sector and avoiding price volatility. The proposed framework allows assessing long-term electricity markets in which multiple policy and market mechanisms interact simultaneously, with market participants responding and adapting to decarbonization pathways.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u957f\u671f\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u5728\u8131\u78b3\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u673a\u5236\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08IPPO\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba9\u5229\u6da6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7684\u53d1\u7535\u516c\u53f8\u6839\u636e\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u7ade\u4e89\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u4fe1\u53f7\u505a\u51fa\u6295\u8d44\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u3001\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u73af\u5883\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u5206\u6563\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\u5e02\u573a\u7ed3\u679c\u7b26\u5408\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u610f\u5927\u5229\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7ade\u4e89\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3001\u5e02\u573a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u60c5\u666f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5e02\u573a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8131\u78b3\u548c\u907f\u514d\u4ef7\u683c\u6ce2\u52a8\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u540c\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u653f\u7b56\u4e0e\u5e02\u573a\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u5728\u590d\u6742\u8131\u78b3\u8def\u5f84\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u78b3\u4e2d\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u957f\u671f\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5982\u62cd\u5356\u3001\u8865\u8d34\u7b49\uff09\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u653f\u7b56\u4e0e\u5e02\u573a\u4e92\u52a8\u65b9\u9762\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u6a21\u62df\u5e02\u573a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u653f\u7b56\u4e0e\u5e02\u573a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u4f7f\u7528\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08IPPO\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u5404\u53d1\u7535\u516c\u53f8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u7ade\u4e89\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b66\u4e60\u6295\u8d44\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u7ade\u4e89\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u786e\u4fdd\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u5747\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u610f\u5927\u5229\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5e02\u573a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0\u8131\u78b3\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u7ef4\u6301\u4ef7\u683c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5177\u6709\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u653f\u7b56\u4e0e\u5e02\u573a\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6295\u8d44\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u53d1\u7535\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u4ef7\u683c\u6ce2\u52a8\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u53cd\u6620\u591a\u4e2a\u673a\u5236\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5e02\u573a\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u590d\u6742\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u671f\u653f\u7b56\u4e0e\u5e02\u573a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63ed\u793a\u5e02\u573a\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u8131\u78b3\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4f4e\u78b3\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the de facto choice in modern systems and achieves this by contrasting conditional and unconditional samples. Recent work explores contrasting negative samples at inference using a weaker model, via strong/weak model pairs, attention-based masking, stochastic block dropping, or perturbations to the self-attention energy landscape. While these strategies refine the generation quality, they still lack reliable control over the granularity or difficulty of the negative samples, and target-layer selection is often fixed. We propose Exponential Moving Average Guidance (EMAG), a training-free mechanism that modifies attention at inference time in diffusion transformers, with a statistics-based, adaptive layer-selection rule. Unlike prior methods, EMAG produces harder, semantically faithful negatives (fine-grained degradations), surfacing difficult failure modes, enabling the denoiser to refine subtle artifacts, boosting the quality and human preference score (HPS) by +0.46 over CFG. We further demonstrate that EMAG naturally composes with advanced guidance techniques, such as APG and CADS, further improving HPS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4fee\u6539\u65b9\u6cd5EMAG\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u96be\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u53ef\u4e0eAPG\u3001CADS\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u5f15\u5bfc\u6280\u672f\u517c\u5bb9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f15\u5bfc\u6280\u672f\u5728\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u4e0a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u76ee\u6807\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u56fa\u5b9a\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u66b4\u9732\u7ec6\u5fae\u7f3a\u9677\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6307\u6570\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u5747\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08EMAG\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u964d\u7ea7\u7684\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7ec6\u5fae\u7455\u75b5\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4CFG\uff0cEMAG\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u8bc4\u5206\uff08HPS\uff09\u4e0a\u63d0\u53470.46\uff1b\u80fd\u81ea\u7136\u878d\u5408APG\u548cCADS\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "EMAG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3-free\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Prior approaches mitigate this via post-hoc selection or eviction but overlook the root inefficiency: indiscriminate writing to persistent memory. In this paper, we formalize KV cache management as a causal system of three primitives: KV Admission, Selection, and Eviction. We instantiate KV Admission via Write-Gated KV, a lightweight mechanism that learns to predict token utility before it enters the cache. By filtering out low-utility states early to maintain a compact global cache alongside a sliding local cache, Write-Gated KV reduces memory usage by 46-57% and delivers 3.03-3.45$\\times$ prefill and 1.89-2.56$\\times$ decode speedups on Llama model with negligible accuracy loss, all while remaining compatible with FlashAttention and paged-KV systems.

However, existing models often struggle to reflect on and correct themselves when attempting incorrect reasoning trajectories. To address this limitation, we propose DRIM, a model that enables deep but reliable multi-turn reasoning when thinking with images in its multimodal CoT. Our pipeline comprises three stages: data construction, cold-start SFT and RL. Based on a high-resolution image dataset, we construct high-difficulty and verifiable visual question-answer pairs, where solving each task requires multi-turn tool calls to reach the correct answer. In the SFT stage, we collect tool trajectories as cold-start data, guiding a multi-turn reasoning pattern. In the RL stage, we introduce redundancy-penalized policy optimization, which incentivizes the model to develop a self-reflective reasoning pattern. The basic idea is to impose judgment on reasoning trajectories and penalize those that produce incorrect answers without sufficient multi-scale exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRIM achieves superior performance on visual understanding benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "DRIM \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u9996\u5148\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u96be\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\u5728 SFT \u9636\u6bb5\u5229\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u521d\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u591a\u8f6e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u5728 RL \u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5165\u5197\u4f59\u60e9\u7f5a\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u63a2\u7d22\u5e76\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDRIM \u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u867d\u5177\u5907\u8f83\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u4e0e\u7ea0\u9519\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u9677\u5165\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fee\u6b63\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u652f\u6301\u591a\u8f6e\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u81ea\u7701\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa DRIM \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a1\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u96be\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u6536\u96c6\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u591a\u8f6e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u5197\u4f59\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6fc0\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u8fdb\u884c\u5224\u65ad\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u65e0\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "result": "DRIM \u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u3001\u9700\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DRIM \u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u4e2d\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u60e9\u7f5a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u7ea0\u9519\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Few-Shot Adaptation (FSA-VLM) has emerged as a key solution, typically using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to adapt models with minimal data. However, these PEFT methods are constrained by their reliance on fixed, handcrafted prompts, which are often insufficient to understand the semantics of classes. While some studies have proposed leveraging image-induced prompts to provide additional clues for classification, they introduce prohibitive computational overhead at inference. Therefore, we introduce Auxiliary Descriptive Knowledge (ADK), a novel framework that efficiently enriches text representations without compromising efficiency. ADK first leverages a Large Language Model to generate a rich set of descriptive prompts for each class offline. These pre-computed features are then deployed in two ways: (1) as Compositional Knowledge, an averaged representation that provides rich semantics, especially beneficial when class names are ambiguous or unfamiliar to the VLM; and (2) as Instance-Specific Knowledge, where a lightweight, non-parametric attention mechanism dynamically selects the most relevant descriptions for a given image. This approach provides two additional types of knowledge alongside the handcrafted prompt, thereby facilitating category distinction across various domains. Also, ADK acts as a parameter-free, plug-and-play component that enhances existing PEFT methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADK consistently boosts the performance of multiple PEFT baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art across various scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u63cf\u8ff0\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08ADK\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002ADK\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u79bb\u7ebf\u751f\u6210\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u90e8\u7f72\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u7ec4\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u8868\u793a\uff09\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7c7b\u522b\u540d\u79f0\u5bf9VLM\u4e0d\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u81f3\u73b0\u6709\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08PEFT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u5206\u7c7b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\uff08FSA-VLM\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08PEFT\uff09\u6709\u6240\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u624b\u5199\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\u7c7b\u522b\u8bed\u4e49\u3002\u5df2\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u63d0\u793a\u867d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u8fc7\u5927\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "ADK\u9996\u5148\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u79bb\u7ebf\u751f\u6210\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63cf\u8ff0\u63d0\u793a\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u4e24\u79cd\u5f62\u5f0f\u4f7f\u7528\uff1a1\uff09\u7ec4\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u2014\u2014\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u5747\u751f\u6210\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\uff1b2\uff09\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\u2014\u2014\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e0\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cADK\u5728\u591a\u4e2aPEFT\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ADK\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u79bb\u7ebf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u63cf\u8ff0\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

To approximate \"never-before-seen\" threats, we homology-cluster the combined dataset at <=40% identity and perform cluster-level holdouts (no cluster overlap between train/test). We report discrimination (AUROC/AUPRC) and screening-operating points (TPR@1% FPR; FPR@95% TPR) with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals (n=200), and we provide calibrated probabilities via CalibratedClassifierCV (isotonic for Logistic Regression / Random Forest; Platt sigmoid for Linear SVM). We quantify probability quality using Brier score, Expected Calibration Error (ECE; 15 bins), and reliability diagrams. Shortcut susceptibility is probed via composition-preserving residue shuffles and length-/composition-only ablations. Empirically, random splits substantially overestimate robustness relative to homology-clustered evaluation; calibrated linear models exhibit comparatively good calibration, while tree ensembles retain slightly higher Brier/ECE.

Our method begins with a 4D aware mask generation module that reconstructs the scene geometry and propagates user specified object placement across frames while maintaining temporal coherence and occlusion consistency. Building upon this spatial foundation, we extend a diffusion based video generation model to jointly synthesize the inserted object and its surrounding local variations such as illumination and shading. To enable supervised training, we introduce ROSE++, an illumination aware synthetic dataset constructed by transforming the ROSE object removal dataset into triplets of object removed video, object present video, and a VLM generated reference image. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework produces geometrically plausible and visually coherent object insertions across diverse real world scenarios, significantly outperforming existing research and commercial models.", "AI": {"tldr": "InsertAnywhere \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u8c61\u63d2\u5165\uff08VOI\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc74D\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u7269\u4f53\u53ca\u5176\u5468\u56f4\u5149\u7167\u3001\u9634\u5f71\u7b49\u5c40\u90e8\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u5916\u89c2\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e86 ROSE++ \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7528\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u8c61\u63d2\u5165\u4ecd\u9762\u4e344D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u906e\u6321\u4e0e\u5149\u7167\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa4D\u611f\u77e5\u63a9\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5757\u4ee5\u91cd\u5efa\u573a\u666f\u51e0\u4f55\u5e76\u8de8\u5e27\u4f20\u64ad\u7528\u6237\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u906e\u6321\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u6269\u5c55\u6269\u6563\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u63d2\u5165\u5bf9\u8c61\u53ca\u5176\u5468\u56f4\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u5982\u5149\u7167\u4e0e\u9634\u5f71\uff1b\u6784\u5efaROSE++\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7531ROSE\u53bb\u5bf9\u8c61\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8f6c\u6362\u800c\u6765\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u79fb\u9664\u5bf9\u8c61\u89c6\u9891\u3001\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u8c61\u89c6\u9891\u53caVLM\u751f\u6210\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u5408\u7406\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u63d2\u5165\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "InsertAnywhere \u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u54084D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u8c61\u63d2\u5165\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In particular, our methods aim to take into account that often only a handful of the constraints may be binding at the optimum, and hence we should evaluate only relevant constraints when trying to optimise a function.

Images were annotated using a custom interface that allowed graders to label arteries, veins, and unknown vessels on separate layers, starting from an initial vessel segmentation mask.

Building on gradient accumulation with micro-batches, this paper introduces GreedySnake, a new SSD-offloaded training system that employs vertical scheduling, which executes all microbatches of a layer before proceeding to the next. Compared to existing systems that use horizontal scheduling (i.e., executing micro-batches sequentially), GreedySnake achieves higher training throughput with smaller batch sizes, bringing the system much closer to the ideal scenario predicted by the roofline model. To further mitigate the I/O bottleneck, GreedySnake overlaps part of the optimization step with the forward pass of the next iteration. Experimental results on A100 GPUs show that GreedySnake achieves saturated training throughput improvements over ZeRO-Infinity: 1.96x on 1 GPU and 1.93x on 4 GPUs for GPT-65B, and 2.53x on 1 GPU for GPT-175B.

Event cameras address this limitation by capturing per-pixel brightness changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution. Prior research on event-based video frame prediction has leveraged motion information from event data, often by predicting event-based optical flow and reconstructing frames via pixel warping. However, such approaches introduce holes and blurring when pixel displacement is inaccurate. To overcome this limitation, we propose DESSERT, a diffusion-based event-driven single-frame synthesis framework via residual training. Leveraging a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model, our method is trained on inter-frame residuals to ensure temporal consistency. The training pipeline consists of two stages: (1) an Event-to-Residual Alignment Variational Autoencoder (ER-VAE) that aligns the event frame between anchor and target frames with the corresponding residual, and (2) a diffusion model that denoises the residual latent conditioned on event data. Furthermore, we introduce Diverse-Length Temporal (DLT) augmentation, which improves robustness by training on frame segments of varying temporal lengths.

Existing robust MLLMs predominantly rely on implicit training/adaptation that focuses solely on visual encoder generalization, suffering from limited interpretability and isolated optimization. To overcome these limitations, we propose Robust-R1, a novel framework that explicitly models visual degradations through structured reasoning chains. Our approach integrates: (i) supervised fine-tuning for degradation-aware reasoning foundations, (ii) reward-driven alignment for accurately perceiving degradation parameters, and (iii) dynamic reasoning depth scaling adapted to degradation intensity. To facilitate this approach, we introduce a specialized 11K dataset featuring realistic degradations synthesized across four critical real-world visual processing stages, each annotated with structured chains connecting degradation parameters, perceptual influence, pristine semantic reasoning chain, and conclusion. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art robustness: Robust-R1 outperforms all general and robust baselines on the real-world degradation benchmark R-Bench, while maintaining superior anti-degradation performance under multi-intensity adversarial degradations on MMMB, MMStar, and RealWorldQA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRobust-R1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u89c6\u89c9\u9000\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b11K\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u56db\u79cd\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u89c6\u89c9\u5904\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u6807\u6ce8\u4e86\u4ece\u9000\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u5230\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u94fe\u6761\u3002\u5728R-Bench\u3001MMMB\u3001MMStar\u548cRealWorldQA\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u9886\u5148\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u9690\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u5b64\u7acb\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6781\u7aef\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u89c6\u89c9\u9000\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRobust-R1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a(i) \u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u9000\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u7840\uff1b(ii) \u5956\u52b1\u9a71\u52a8\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u611f\u77e5\u9000\u5316\u53c2\u6570\uff1b(iii) \u52a8\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u8c03\u8282\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u9000\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a11K\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u7c7b\u771f\u5b9e\u9000\u5316\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6bcf\u6761\u6837\u672c\u5747\u6807\u6ce8\u9000\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u5f71\u54cd\u3001\u539f\u59cb\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u4e0e\u7ed3\u8bba\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u94fe\u6761\u3002", "result": "Robust-R1\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u9000\u5316\u57fa\u51c6R-Bench\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u6240\u6709\u901a\u7528\u53ca\u9c81\u68d2\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728MMMB\u3001MMStar\u548cRealWorldQA\u4e0a\u7684\u591a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6297\u9000\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6297\u9000\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "Robust-R1\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u9000\u5316\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u89c6\u89c9\u9000\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

However, most VLMs either focus on small regions of interest within whole-slide images, provide only static slide-level outputs, or rely on data that is not publicly available, limiting reproducibility. Furthermore, training data containing WSIs paired with detailed clinical reports is scarce, restricting progress toward transparent and generalisable VLMs. We address these limitations with three main contributions. First, we introduce Polysome, a standardised tool for synthetic instruction generation. Second, we apply Polysome to the public HISTAI dataset, generating HISTAI-Instruct, a large whole-slide instruction tuning dataset spanning 24,259 slides and over 1.1 million instruction-response pairs. Finally, we use HISTAI-Instruct to train ANTONI-\u03b1, a VLM capable of visual-question answering (VQA).

However, current methods mainly focus on handling humans wearing tight clothing and perform poorly when estimating body shapes and poses under diverse clothing, especially loose garments. To this end, we make two key insights: (1) tailoring clothing to fit the human body can mitigate the adverse impact of clothing on 3D human mesh recovery, and (2) utilizing human visual information from large foundational models can enhance the generalization ability of the estimation. Based on these insights, we propose ClothHMR, to accurately recover 3D meshes of humans in diverse clothing. ClothHMR primarily consists of two modules: clothing tailoring (CT) and FHVM-based mesh recovering (MR). The CT module employs body semantic estimation and body edge prediction to tailor the clothing, ensuring it fits the body silhouette. The MR module optimizes the initial parameters of the 3D human mesh by continuously aligning the intermediate representations of the 3D mesh with those inferred from the foundational human visual model (FHVM). ClothHMR can accurately recover 3D meshes of humans wearing diverse clothing, precisely estimating their body shapes and poses. Experimental results demonstrate that ClothHMR significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across benchmark datasets and in-the-wild images. Additionally, a web application for online fashion and shopping powered by ClothHMR is developed, illustrating that ClothHMR can effectively serve real-world usage scenarios.

Submitted to ICRA 2026", "summary": "Safe reinforcement learning (SafeRL) is a prominent paradigm for autonomous driving, where agents are required to optimize performance under strict safety requirements. This dual objective creates a fundamental tension, as overly conservative policies limit driving efficiency while aggressive exploration risks safety violations. The Safety Representations for Safer Policy Learning (SRPL) framework addresses this challenge by equipping agents with a predictive model of future constraint violations and has shown promise in controlled environments. This paper investigates whether SRPL extends to real-world autonomous driving scenarios. Systematic experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and NuPlan demonstrate that SRPL can improve the reward-safety tradeoff, achieving statistically significant improvements in success rate (effect sizes r = 0.65-0.86) and cost reduction (effect sizes r = 0.70-0.83), with p < 0.05 for observed improvements. However, its effectiveness depends on the underlying policy optimizer and the dataset distribution. The results further show that predictive safety representations play a critical role in improving robustness to observation noise. Additionally, in zero-shot cross-dataset evaluation, SRPL-augmented agents demonstrate improved generalization compared to non-SRPL methods. These findings collectively demonstrate the potential of predictive safety representations to strengthen SafeRL for autonomous driving.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6SRPL\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5956\u52b1-\u5b89\u5168\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5728Waymo\u548cNuPlan\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u89c2\u6d4b\u566a\u58f0\u66f4\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002SRPL\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e2d\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u4e25\u683c\u5b89\u5168\u8981\u6c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4fdd\u5b88\u5f71\u54cd\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6fc0\u8fdb\u63a2\u7d22\u5219\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u5b89\u5168\u4e8b\u6545\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982SRPL\u867d\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eWaymo Open Motion Dataset\uff08WOMD\uff09\u548cNuPlan\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30SRPL\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fc1\u79fb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "SRPL\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff08\u6548\u5e94\u91cfr = 0.65\u20130.86\uff09\u548c\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\uff08\u6548\u5e94\u91cfr = 0.70\u20130.83\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\uff08p < 0.05\uff09\u3002\u5176\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u89c2\u6d4b\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

However, traditional explicit warping approaches often struggle with accurate motion transfer or recovering missing regions, while recent attention-based warping methods, though effective, frequently suffer from high complexity and weak geometric grounding. To address these issues, we propose SynergyWarpNet, an attention-guided cooperative warping framework designed for high-fidelity talking head synthesis. Given a source portrait, a driving image, and a set of reference images, our model progressively refines the animation in three stages. First, an explicit warping module performs coarse spatial alignment between the source and driving image using 3D dense optical flow.

Depending on the brain tumor type, the FLAIR hyperintensity volume is an important measure to asses the tumor volume or surrounding edema, and an automatic segmentation of this would be useful in the clinic. In this study, around 5000 FLAIR images of various tumors types and acquisition time points from different centers were used to train a unified FLAIR hyperintensity segmentation model using an Attention U-Net architecture. The performance was compared against dataset specific models, and was validated on different tumor types, acquisition time points and against BraTS. The unified model achieved an average Dice score of 88.65\\% for pre-operative meningiomas, 80.08% for pre-operative metastasis, 90.92% for pre-operative and 84.60% for post-operative gliomas from BraTS, and 84.47% for pre-operative and 61.27\\% for post-operative lower grade gliomas. In addition, the results showed that the unified model achieved comparable segmentation performance to the dataset specific models on their respective datasets, and enables generalization across tumor types and acquisition time points, which facilitates the deployment in a clinical setting.

However, this performance is often dependent on the presence of large and varied datasets. In some settings, like in the medical domain, data is often fragmented across parties, and cannot be readily shared. While federated learning addresses this situation, it is a solution that requires synchronicity of parties training a single model together, exchanging information about model weights. We investigate how asynchronous collaboration, where only already trained models are shared (e.g. as part of a publication), affects performance, and propose to use stitching as a method for combining models.\n  Through taking a multi-objective perspective, where performance on each parties' data is viewed independently, we find that training solely on a single parties' data results in similar performance when merging with another parties' data, when considering performance on that single parties' data, while performance on other parties' data is notably worse. Moreover, while an ensemble of such individually trained networks generalizes better, performance on each parties' own dataset suffers. We find that combining intermediate representations in individually trained models with a well placed pair of stitching layers allows this performance to recover to a competitive degree while maintaining improved generalization, showing that asynchronous collaboration can yield competitive results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u6cd5\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6b65\u534f\u4f5c\uff08\u4ec5\u5171\u4eab\u5df2\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u201c\u62fc\u63a5\u201d\uff08stitching\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e2\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u53c8\u6062\u590d\u5404\u53c2\u4e0e\u65b9\u81ea\u8eab\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5355\u7eaf\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u5408\u5e76\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6570\u636e\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u800c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5408\u9002\u7684\u62fc\u63a5\u5c42\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5404\u53c2\u4e0e\u65b9\u672c\u5730\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5f02\u6b65\u534f\u4f5c\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u56e0\u9690\u79c1\u6216\u6cd5\u89c4\u9650\u5236\u88ab\u5206\u6563\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u673a\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u96c6\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u90e8\u5206\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u540c\u6b65\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u9891\u7e41\u53c2\u6570\u4ea4\u6362\uff0c\u5b9e\u65bd\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u534f\u4f5c\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u5df2\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u89c6\u89d2\u8bc4\u4f30\u5404\u53c2\u4e0e\u65b9\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u62fc\u63a5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5730\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u63d2\u5165\u4e00\u5bf9\u62fc\u63a5\u5c42\uff0c\u5bf9\u5404\u81ea\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4f7f\u6700\u7ec8\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u517c\u987e\u672c\u5730\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u5355\u65b9\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5408\u5e76\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u8be5\u65b9\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u8fd1\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u660e\u663e\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u800c\u91c7\u7528\u62fc\u63a5\u5c42\u7684\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6062\u590d\u5404\u53c2\u4e0e\u65b9\u672c\u5730\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f02\u6b65\u534f\u4f5c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u5df2\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u62fc\u63a5\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u540c\u6b65\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9694\u79bb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

A critical limitation of current detectors is their failure to generalize to images from unseen generative models, as they often overfit to source-specific semantic cues rather than learning universal generative artifacts. To overcome this, we introduce a simple yet remarkably effective pixel-level mapping pre-processing step to disrupt the pixel value distribution of images and break the fragile, non-essential semantic patterns that detectors commonly exploit as shortcuts. This forces the detector to focus on more fundamental and generalizable high-frequency traces inherent to the image generation process. Through comprehensive experiments on GAN and diffusion-based generators, we show that our approach significantly boosts the cross-generator performance of state-of-the-art detectors. Extensive analysis further verifies our hypothesis that the disruption of semantic cues is the key to generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6620\u5c04\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7834\u574f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u503c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5bf9\u6e90\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u66f4\u672c\u8d28\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u751f\u6210\u75d5\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u8de8\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5b9a\u6e90\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\u800c\u975e\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u7528\u751f\u6210\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6620\u5c04\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u6270\u4e71\u56fe\u50cf\u50cf\u7d20\u503c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u975e\u5fc5\u8981\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8feb\u4f7f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5173\u6ce8\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728GAN\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u8de8\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7834\u574f\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u5feb\u901f\u6f14\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, progress has been limited by the absence of public datasets and standardized benchmarks. Existing studies are often not directly comparable, as they use private data and inconsistent evaluation frameworks. To address this, we present MGRegBench, a public benchmark dataset for mammogram registration. It comprises over 5,000 image pairs, with 100 containing manual anatomical landmarks and segmentation masks for rigorous evaluation. This makes MGRegBench one of the largest public 2D registration datasets with manual annotations. Using this resource, we benchmarked diverse registration methods including classical (ANTs), learning-based (VoxelMorph, TransMorph), implicit neural representation (IDIR), a classic mammography-specific approach, and a recent state-of-the-art deep learning method MammoRegNet. The implementations were adapted to this modality from the authors' implementations or re-implemented from scratch.

This article extends known convergence guarantees of an algorithm operating in isolation (i.e., without disturbances) and systematically derives stability bounds and convergence rates in the presence of such disturbances. By leveraging converse Lyapunov theorems, we derive key inequalities that quantify the impact of disturbances. We further demonstrate how our result can be utilized to assess the effects of disturbances on algorithmic performance in a wide variety of applications, including communication constraints in distributed learning, sensitivity in machine learning generalization, and intentional noise injection for privacy.

In this paper, we propose the Affective Image Filter (AIF) task, which aims to reflect visually-abstract emotions from text into visually-concrete images, thereby creating emotionally compelling results. We first introduce the AIF dataset and the formulation of the AIF models. Then, we present AIF-B as an initial attempt based on a multi-modal transformer architecture. After that, we propose AIF-D as an extension of AIF-B towards deeper emotional reflection, effectively leveraging generative priors from pre-trained large-scale diffusion models. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that AIF models achieve superior performance for both content consistency and emotional fidelity compared to state-of-the-art methods.

In realistic settings, interventions are rarely isolated: organizations need to align sequences of interventions to jointly steer the outcome of a case. Existing PresPM approaches fall short in this respect. Many focus on a single intervention decision, while others treat multiple interventions independently, ignoring how they interact over time. Methods that do address these dependencies depend either on simulation or data augmentation to approximate the process to train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent, which can create a reality gap and introduce bias. We introduce SCOPE, a PresPM approach that learns aligned sequential intervention recommendations. SCOPE employs backward induction to estimate the effect of each candidate intervention action, propagating its impact from the final decision point back to the first. By leveraging causal learners, our method can utilize observational data directly, unlike methods that require constructing process approximations for reinforcement learning. Experiments on both an existing synthetic dataset and a new semi-synthetic dataset show that SCOPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PresPM techniques in optimizing the KPI.

However, the dominant two-stage pipeline (SFT then RL) suffers from a key inconsistency: SFT enforces rigid imitation that suppresses exploration and induces forgetting, limiting RL's potential for improvements. We address this inefficiency with TRAPO (\\textbf{T}rust-\\textbf{R}egion \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{P}olicy \\textbf{O}ptimization), a hybrid framework that interleaves SFT and RL within each training instance by optimizing SFT loss on expert prefixes and RL loss on the model's own completions, unifying external supervision and self-exploration. To stabilize training, we introduce Trust-Region SFT (TrSFT), which minimizes forward KL divergence inside a trust region but attenuates optimization outside, effectively shifting toward reverse KL and yielding stable, mode-seeking updates favorable for RL. An adaptive prefix-selection mechanism further allocates expert guidance based on measured utility. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that TRAPO consistently surpasses standard SFT, RL, and SFT-then-RL pipelines, as well as recent state-of-the-art approaches, establishing a strong new paradigm for reasoning-enhanced LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "TRAPO\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e2d\u4ea4\u9519\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08\u5148SFT\u540eRL\uff09\u4e2d\u56e0\u4e25\u683c\u6a21\u4eff\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u6291\u5236\u548c\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u524d\u7f00\u4e0a\u4f18\u5316SFT\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8865\u5168\u4e0a\u4f18\u5316RL\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u81ea\u6211\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57dfSFT\uff08TrSFT\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u524d\u5411KL\u6563\u5ea6\u5e76\u8870\u51cf\u5916\u90e8\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u504f\u5411\u53cd\u5411KL\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u524d\u7f00\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u6839\u636e\u6548\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u4e13\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cTRAPO\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6SFT\u3001RL\u53caSFT-then-RL\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08\u5148SFT\u540eRL\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff1aSFT\u5f3a\u5236\u6a21\u4eff\u4f1a\u6291\u5236\u63a2\u7d22\u5e76\u5f15\u53d1\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u81ea\u6211\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "TRAPO\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u9519\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316SFT\u635f\u5931\uff08\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u524d\u7f00\u4e0a\uff09\u548cRL\u635f\u5931\uff08\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8865\u5168\u4e0a\uff09\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57dfSFT\uff08TrSFT\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u524d\u5411KL\u6563\u5ea6\u5e76\u8870\u51cf\u5916\u90e8\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u6a21\u5f0f\u805a\u7126\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u524d\u7f00\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u4e13\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cTRAPO consistently \u8d85\u8d8a\u6807\u51c6SFT\u3001RL\u3001SFT-then-RL\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TRAPO\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u6c42\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To bridge this gap, we introduce AIFloodSense, a comprehensive, publicly available aerial imagery dataset comprising 470 high-resolution images from 230 distinct flood events across 64 countries and six continents. Unlike prior benchmarks, AIFloodSense ensures global diversity and temporal relevance (2022-2024), supporting three complementary tasks: (i) Image Classification with novel sub-tasks for environment type, camera angle, and continent recognition; (ii) Semantic Segmentation providing precise pixel-level masks for flood, sky, and buildings; and (iii) Visual Question Answering (VQA) to enable natural language reasoning for disaster assessment.

For the polyharmonic cascade, a training method alternative to gradient descent is proposed: instead of directly optimizing the coefficients, one solves a single global linear system on each batch with respect to the function values at fixed \"constellations\" of nodes. This yields synchronized updates of all layers, preserves the probabilistic interpretation of individual layers and theoretical consistency with the original model, and scales well: all computations reduce to 2D matrix operations efficiently executed on a GPU.

However, most existing feature selection approaches either operate as multi-stage pipelines or rely on post hoc feature attribution, making selection and prediction weakly coupled. In this work, we present YOTO (you only train once), an end-to-end framework that jointly identifies discrete gene subsets and performs prediction within a single differentiable architecture. In our model, the prediction task directly guides which genes are selected, while the learned subsets, in turn, shape the predictive representation. This closed feedback loop enables the model to iteratively refine both what it selects and how it predicts during training. Unlike existing approaches, YOTO enforces sparsity so that only the selected genes contribute to inference, eliminating the need to train additional downstream classifiers. Through a multi-task learning design, the model learns shared representations across related objectives, allowing partially labeled datasets to inform one another, and discovering gene subsets that generalize across tasks without additional training steps. We evaluate YOTO on two representative single-cell RNA-seq datasets, showing that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These results demonstrate that sparse, end-to-end, multi-task gene subset selection improves predictive performance and yields compact and meaningful gene subsets, advancing biomarker discovery and single-cell analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "YOTO \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u5b50\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u56e0\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u7b5b\u9009\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u76f4\u63a5\u6307\u5bfc\u57fa\u56e0\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u9009\u62e9\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002\u5176\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u8ba1\u652f\u6301\u90e8\u5206\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u95f4\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5355\u7ec6\u80deRNA-seq\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cYOTO\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u56e0\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4e3a\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8b\u540e\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u8131\u8282\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5c06\u57fa\u56e0\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7d27\u5bc6\u7ed3\u5408\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faYOTO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u5fae\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u56e0\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u7ea6\u675f\u786e\u4fdd\u4ec5\u9009\u4e2d\u57fa\u56e0\u53c2\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u5171\u4eab\u8868\u793a\u5e76\u76f8\u4e92\u4fc3\u8fdb\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u53cd\u9988\u5f15\u5bfc\u57fa\u56e0\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u95ed\u73af\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5355\u7ec6\u80deRNA-seq\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cYOTO\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u5b50\u96c6\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff1b\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "YOTO\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u3001\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u5b50\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u57fa\u56e0\u5b50\u96c6\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We establish convergence guarantees for FedSARSA in the presence of heterogeneity, both in local transitions and rewards, providing the first sample and communication complexity bounds in this setting. At the core of our analysis is a new, exact multi-step error expansion for single-agent SARSA, which is of independent interest. Our analysis precisely quantifies the impact of heterogeneity, demonstrating the convergence of FedSARSA with multiple local updates. Crucially, we show that FedSARSA achieves linear speed-up with respect to the number of agents, up to higher-order terms due to Markovian sampling.

Yet, current deep learning methods rely on centralized data collection, which raises privacy concerns and limits generalization across diverse institutions. In this paper, we propose TwinSegNet, which is a privacy-preserving federated learning framework that integrates a hybrid ViT-UNet model with personalized digital twins for accurate and real-time brain tumor segmentation. Our architecture combines convolutional encoders with Vision Transformer bottlenecks to capture local and global context. Each institution fine-tunes the global model of private data to form its digital twin. Evaluated on nine heterogeneous MRI datasets, including BraTS 2019-2021 and custom tumor collections, TwinSegNet achieves high Dice scores (up to 0.90%) and sensitivity/specificity exceeding 90%, demonstrating robustness across non-independent and identically distributed (IID) client distributions. Comparative results against centralized models such as TumorVisNet highlight TwinSegNet's effectiveness in preserving privacy without sacrificing performance.

However, this process often leads to catastrophic forgetting of the model's prior domain knowledge.

Our approach estimates the model's confidence in each parameter and constrains updates in high-curvature directions, preserving prior knowledge while enabling efficient target-domain learning. By applying the Laplace approximation only to the LoRA weights, the method remains lightweight. We evaluate LaLoRA by fine-tuning a Llama model for mathematical reasoning and demonstrate an improved learning-forgetting trade-off, which can be directly controlled via the method's regularization strength.

In this paper, we present an illuminant personalization method named LumiCtrl that learns an illuminant prompt given a single image of an object. LumiCtrl consists of three basic components: given an image of the object, our method applies (a) physics-based illuminant augmentation along the Planckian locus to create fine-tuning variants under standard illuminants; (b) edge-guided prompt disentanglement using a frozen ControlNet to ensure prompts focus on illumination rather than structure; and (c) a masked reconstruction loss that focuses learning on the foreground object while allowing the background to adapt contextually, enabling what we call contextual light adaptation. We qualitatively and quantitatively compare LumiCtrl against other T2I customization methods. The results show that our method achieves significantly better illuminant fidelity, aesthetic quality, and scene coherence compared to existing personalization baselines. A human preference study further confirms strong user preference for LumiCtrl outputs.

We introduce the Multi-Modal Landmark dataset (MMLANDMARKS), a benchmark composed of four modalities: 197k highresolution aerial images, 329k ground-view images, textual information, and geographic coordinates for 18,557 distinct landmarks in the United States. The MMLANDMARKS dataset has a one-to-one correspondence across every modality, which enables training and benchmarking models for various geo-spatial tasks, including cross-view Ground-to-Satellite retrieval, ground and satellite geolocalization, Text-to-Image, and Text-to-GPS retrieval. We demonstrate broad generalization and competitive performance against off-the-shelf foundational models and specialized state-of-the-art models across different tasks by employing a simple CLIP-inspired baseline, illustrating the necessity for multimodal datasets to achieve broad geo-spatial understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5730\u6807\u6570\u636e\u96c6MMLANDMARKS\uff0c\u5305\u542b197k\u9ad8\u7a7a\u56fe\u50cf\u3001329k\u5730\u9762\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u5730\u7406\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u7f8e\u56fd18,557\u4e2a\u72ec\u7279\u5730\u6807\u3002\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u56db\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u5177\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u4e00\u4e00\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u53ca\u6587\u672c\u5230GPS\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684CLIP\u7c7b\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u8986\u76d6\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u6574\u5408\u6240\u6709\u76f8\u5173\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u8986\u76d6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaMMLANDMARKS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u9ad8\u7a7a\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u5730\u9762\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0e\u5730\u7406\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u5404\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eCLIP\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5730\u9762\u5230\u536b\u661f\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u7b49\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MMLANDMARKS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63a8\u52a8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5730\u7406\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u7b80\u5355\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u5f02\u8868\u73b0\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

Existing methods mainly fall into two categories: (1) static world generation models, which construct 3D environments without active agents, and (2) controllable-entity models, which allow a single entity to perform limited actions in an otherwise uncontrollable environment. In this work, we introduce AniX, leveraging the realism and structural grounding of static world generation while extending controllable-entity models to support user-specified characters capable of performing open-ended actions. Users can provide a 3DGS scene and a character, then direct the character through natural language to perform diverse behaviors from basic locomotion to object-centric interactions while freely exploring the environment. AniX synthesizes temporally coherent video clips that preserve visual fidelity with the provided scene and character, formulated as a conditional autoregressive video generation problem. Built upon a pre-trained video generator, our training strategy significantly enhances motion dynamics while maintaining generalization across actions and characters. Our evaluation covers a broad range of aspects, including visual quality, character consistency, action controllability, and long-horizon coherence.", "AI": {"tldr": "AniX \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u4e16\u754c\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u5b9e\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u6307\u5b9a\u89d2\u8272\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6267\u884c\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u573a\u666f\u4e0e\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u89d2\u8272\u3001\u8de8\u52a8\u4f5c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u73af\u5883\u6216\u5355\u4e00\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u6709\u9650\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u89d2\u8272\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002AniX\u65e8\u5728\u7a81\u7834\u8fd9\u4e00\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u7684\u865a\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u5c063DGS\u573a\u666f\u4e0e\u89d2\u8272\u8f93\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u8fd0\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAniX \u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u89d2\u8272\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u53ca\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u89d2\u8272\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "AniX \u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u5b9a\u5236\u89d2\u8272\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u611f3D\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u865a\u62df\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve impressive scores on existing benchmarks, a fundamental question remains: can MLLMs truly ground language in vision with human-like sophistication, or are they merely pattern-matching on simplified datasets? Current benchmarks fail to capture real-world complexity where humans effortlessly navigate ambiguous references and recognize when grounding is impossible. To rigorously assess MLLMs' true capabilities, we introduce GroundingME, a benchmark that systematically challenges models across four critical dimensions: (1) Discriminative, distinguishing highly similar objects, (2) Spatial, understanding complex relational descriptions, (3) Limited, handling occlusions or tiny objects, and (4) Rejection, recognizing ungroundable queries. Through careful curation combining automated generation with human verification, we create 1,005 challenging examples mirroring real-world complexity. Evaluating 25 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a profound capability gap: the best model achieves only 45.1% accuracy, while most score 0% on rejection tasks, reflexively hallucinating objects rather than acknowledging their absence, raising critical safety concerns for deployment. We explore two strategies for improvements: (1) test-time scaling selects optimal response by thinking trajectory to improve complex grounding by up to 2.9%, and (2) data-mixture training teaches models to recognize ungroundable queries, boosting rejection accuracy from 0% to 27.9%. GroundingME thus serves as both a diagnostic tool revealing current limitations in MLLMs and a roadmap toward human-level visual grounding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGroundingME\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533a\u5206\u76f8\u4f3c\u7269\u4f53\u3001\u7406\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u5904\u7406\u906e\u6321\u4e0e\u5fae\u5c0f\u7269\u4f53\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u67e5\u8be2\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u9876\u5c16\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec545.1%\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u62d2\u7edd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6781\u5dee\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u62d2\u7edd\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u5177\u5907\u7c7b\u4eba\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u5f15\u7528\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u67e5\u8be2\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u76f2\u533a\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaGroundingME\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba11005\u4e2a\u9ad8\u96be\u5ea6\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u56db\u5927\u6311\u6218\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1a\u5224\u522b\u6027\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6027\u3001\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u4e0e\u62d2\u7edd\u6027\u3002\u5bf925\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e24\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6700\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a45.1%\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u62d2\u7edd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a0%\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u503e\u5411\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u62d2\u7edd\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece0%\u63d0\u5347\u81f327.9%\uff1b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u4f7f\u590d\u6742\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u591a2.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "GroundingME\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6027\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdb\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, existing MIPL approaches often suffer from poor calibration, undermining classifier reliability. In this work, we propose a plug-and-play calibratable disambiguation loss (CDL) that simultaneously improves classification accuracy and calibration performance. The loss has two instantiations: the first one calibrates predictions based on probabilities from the candidate label set, while the second one integrates probabilities from both candidate and non-candidate label sets. The proposed CDL can be seamlessly incorporated into existing MIPL and PLL frameworks. We provide a theoretical analysis that establishes the lower bound and regularization properties of CDL, demonstrating its superiority over conventional disambiguation losses. Experimental results on benchmark and real-world datasets confirm that our CDL significantly enhances both classification and calibration performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u63d2\u62d4\u7684\u53ef\u6821\u51c6\u6d88\u6b67\u635f\u5931\uff08CDL\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u90e8\u5206\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MIPL\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u3002CDL\u6709\u4e24\u79cd\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u5f0f\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5019\u9009\u6807\u7b7e\u96c6\u7684\u6982\u7387\u8fdb\u884c\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u5219\u7ed3\u5408\u5019\u9009\u4e0e\u975e\u5019\u9009\u6807\u7b7e\u96c6\u7684\u6982\u7387\u3002\u8be5\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709MIPL\u548cPLL\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCDL\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u6821\u51c6\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MIPL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u56e0\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u63d2\u62d4\u7684\u53ef\u6821\u51c6\u6d88\u6b67\u635f\u5931\uff08CDL\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709MIPL/PLL\u6846\u67b6\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCDL\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4e0b\u754c\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684CDL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3aMIPL\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u6821\u51c6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

The performance of pathology AI systems has been almost exclusively evaluated on European and US cohorts from large centers. For global AI adoption in pathology, validation studies on currently under-represented populations - where the potential gains from AI support may also be greatest - are needed. We present the first study with an external validation cohort from the Middle East, focusing on AI-based diagnosis and Gleason grading of prostate cancer.\n  Methods: We collected and digitised 339 prostate biopsy specimens from the Kurdistan region, Iraq, representing a consecutive series of 185 patients spanning the period 2013-2024. We evaluated a task-specific end-to-end AI model and two foundation models in terms of their concordance with pathologists and consistency across samples digitised on three scanner models (Hamamatsu, Leica, and Grundium).\n  Findings: Grading concordance between AI and pathologists was similar to pathologist-pathologist concordance with Cohen's quadratically weighted kappa 0.801 vs. 0.799 (p=0.9824). Cross-scanner concordance was high (quadratically weighted kappa > 0.90) for all AI models and scanner pairs, including low-cost compact scanner.\n  Interpretation: AI models demonstrated pathologist-level performance in prostate histopathology assessment. Compact scanners can provide a route for validation studies in non-digitalised settings and enable cost-effective adoption of AI in laboratories with limited sample volumes.

To do so, several works completely replace ID embeddings with modality embeddings, claiming that modality embeddings render ID embeddings unnecessary because they can match or even exceed ID embedding performance. On the other hand, many works jointly utilize ID and modality features, but posit that complex fusion strategies, such as multi-stage training and/or intricate alignment architectures, are necessary for this joint utilization. However, underlying both these lines of work is a lack of understanding of the complementarity of ID and modality features. In this work, we address this gap by studying the complementarity of ID- and text-based SR models. We show that these models do learn complementary signals, meaning that either should provide performance gain when used properly alongside the other.

These methods are typically formulated via overdamped or underdamped Ornstein--Uhlenbeck-type stochastic differential equations, in which sampling is driven by a combination of deterministic drift and Brownian diffusion, resulting in continuous particle trajectories in the ambient space. While such dynamics enjoy exponential convergence guarantees for strongly log-concave target distributions, it is well known that their mixing rates deteriorate exponentially in the presence of nonconvex or multimodal landscapes, such as double-well potentials. Since many practical generative modeling tasks involve highly non-log-concave target distributions, considerable recent effort has been devoted to developing sampling schemes that improve exploration beyond classical diffusion dynamics.\n  A promising line of work leverages tools from information geometry to augment diffusion-based samplers with controlled mass reweighting mechanisms. This perspective leads naturally to Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao (WFR) geometries, which couple transport in the sample space with vertical (reaction) dynamics on the space of probability measures. In this work, we formulate such reweighting mechanisms through the introduction of explicit correction terms and show how they can be implemented via weighted stochastic differential equations using the Feynman--Kac representation. Our study provides a preliminary but rigorous investigation of WFR-based sampling dynamics, and aims to clarify their geometric and operator-theoretic structure as a foundation for future theoretical and algorithmic developments.", "AI": {"tldr": "This work advances score-based diffusion models by incorporating Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao geometry through controlled mass reweighting, enabling better sampling in nonconvex landscapes via weighted SDEs and Feynman--Kac theory, establishing a foundational framework for future research.", "motivation": "To address the limitations of classical diffusion models in nonconvex or multimodal landscapes, which suffer from slow mixing rates, this paper explores enhanced sampling schemes using information geometry.", "method": "The authors introduce correction terms to implement mass reweighting mechanisms within a Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao (WFR) geometric framework, leveraging weighted stochastic differential equations via the Feynman--Kac representation.", "result": "The study provides a rigorous analysis of WFR-based sampling dynamics, revealing their geometric and operator-theoretic structure, and lays the foundation for future theoretical and algorithmic advancements in generative modeling.", "conclusion": "WFR-based dynamics offer a promising direction for improving exploration in complex, non-log-concave distributions, with potential for more efficient and robust sampling in real-world generative tasks."}}

Kernel-based operator learning can offer accurate, theoretically justified approximations that require less training than standard methods. However, they can become computationally prohibitive for large training sets and can be sensitive to noise. We propose a regularized random Fourier feature (RRFF) approach, coupled with a finite element reconstruction map (RRFF-FEM), for learning operators from noisy data. The method uses random features drawn from multivariate Student's $t$ distributions, together with frequency-weighted Tikhonov regularization that suppresses high-frequency noise. We establish high-probability bounds on the extreme singular values of the associated random feature matrix and show that when the number of features $N$ scales like $m \\log m$ with the number of training samples $m$, the system is well-conditioned, which yields estimation and generalization guarantees. Detailed numerical experiments on benchmark PDE problems, including advection, Burgers', Darcy flow, Helmholtz, Navier-Stokes, and structural mechanics, demonstrate that RRFF and RRFF-FEM are robust to noise and achieve improved performance with reduced training time compared to the unregularized random feature model, while maintaining competitive accuracy relative to kernel and neural operator tests.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u968f\u673a\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u6709\u9650\u5143\u91cd\u6784\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08RRFF-FEM\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u5b50\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5143\u5b66\u751ft\u5206\u5e03\u751f\u6210\u7684\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u9891\u7387\u52a0\u6743\u7684Tikhonov\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6291\u5236\u9ad8\u9891\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u7279\u5f81\u6570N\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u6570m\u6ee1\u8db3N ~ m log m\u65f6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6761\u4ef6\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5178\u578bPDE\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u5177\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u53ca\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u968f\u673a\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7279\u5f81\uff08RRFF\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6709\u9650\u5143\u91cd\u6784\u6620\u5c04\uff08RRFF-FEM\uff09\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6765\u81ea\u591a\u5143\u5b66\u751ft\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u9891\u7387\u52a0\u6743\u7684Tikhonov\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u9ad8\u9891\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u6570\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u6570\u5448m log m\u5173\u7cfb\u65f6\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u6709\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u6709\u754c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u826f\u597d\u6761\u4ef6\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53N ~ m log m\u65f6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6761\u4ef6\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u672a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u7ecf\u5178\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "RRFF-FEM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

RadarGen adapts efficient image-latent diffusion to the radar domain by representing radar measurements in bird's-eye-view form that encodes spatial structure together with radar cross section (RCS) and Doppler attributes. A lightweight recovery step reconstructs point clouds from the generated maps. To better align generation with the visual scene, RadarGen incorporates BEV-aligned depth, semantic, and motion cues extracted from pretrained foundation models, which guide the stochastic generation process toward physically plausible radar patterns. Conditioning on images makes the approach broadly compatible, in principle, with existing visual datasets and simulation frameworks, offering a scalable direction for multimodal generative simulation. Evaluations on large-scale driving data show that RadarGen captures characteristic radar measurement distributions and reduces the gap to perception models trained on real data, marking a step toward unified generative simulation across sensing modalities.", "AI": {"tldr": "RadarGen \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6c7d\u8f66\u96f7\u8fbe\u70b9\u4e91\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u76f8\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u7684\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u3002\u5b83\u5c06\u96f7\u8fbe\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u4ee5\u9e1f\u77b0\u56fe\u5f62\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u96f7\u8fbe\u622a\u9762\uff08RCS\uff09\u548c\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6062\u590d\u6b65\u9aa4\u91cd\u5efa\u70b9\u4e91\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5165\u6765\u81ea\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684BEV\u5bf9\u9f50\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u517c\u5bb9\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eff\u771f\u3002\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cRadarGen \u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u96f7\u8fbe\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5178\u578b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8de8\u4f20\u611f\u6a21\u6001\u7edf\u4e00\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eff\u771f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4f46\u771f\u5b9e\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u89c4\u6a21\u6709\u9650\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u7684\u96f7\u8fbe\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4eff\u771f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u534f\u540c\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eff\u771f\u3002", "method": "RadarGen \u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u56fe\u50cf-\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u96f7\u8fbe\u6d4b\u91cf\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9e1f\u77b0\u56fe\uff08BEV\uff09\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u96f7\u8fbe\u622a\u9762\uff08RCS\uff09\u548c\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4ece\u751f\u6210\u7684BEV\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\u70b9\u4e91\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u7684BEV\u5bf9\u9f50\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u96f7\u8fbe\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cRadarGen \u751f\u6210\u7684\u96f7\u8fbe\u70b9\u4e91\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5176\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u96f7\u8fbe\u6d4b\u91cf\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u660e\u663e\u7f29\u5c0f\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "RadarGen \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u96f7\u8fbe\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u5411\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4eff\u771f\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

Thus, an adversary could aim to modify an image by adding unseen elements, which will confuse the AI in its recognition of an entity. This paper thus investigates the adversarial robustness of LLaVA-1.5-13B and Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision-8B-2. These are tested for untargeted PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) against the visual input modality, and empirically evaluated on the Visual Question Answering (VQA) v2 dataset subset. The results of these adversarial attacks are then quantified using the standard VQA accuracy metric. This evaluation is then compared with the accuracy degradation (accuracy drop) of LLaVA and Llama 3.2 Vision. A key finding is that Llama 3.2 Vision, despite a lower baseline accuracy in this setup, exhibited a smaller drop in performance under attack compared to LLaVA, particularly at higher perturbation levels. Overall, the findings confirm that the vision modality represents a viable attack vector for degrading the performance of contemporary open-weight VLMs, including Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision. Furthermore, they highlight that adversarial robustness does not necessarily correlate directly with standard benchmark performance and may be influenced by underlying architectural and training factors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86LLaVA-1.5-13B\u548cMeta\u7684Llama 3.2 Vision-8B-2\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u672a\u5b9a\u5411PGD\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eVQA v2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b50\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1Llama 3.2 Vision\u57fa\u7ebf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u6270\u52a8\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u66f4\u5c0f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\u662f\u653b\u51fb\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cd\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u65e0\u76f4\u63a5\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u53d7\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u7406\u89e3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5982\u4f55\u8bc6\u522b\u7269\u4f53\u53d8\u5f97\u6108\u53d1\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5bf9\u624b\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u6765\u5e72\u6270\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u672a\u5b9a\u5411\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff08PGD\uff09\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9LLaVA-1.5-13B\u548cLlama 3.2 Vision-8B-2\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728VQA v2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6VQA\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u91cf\u5316\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e24\u8005\u5728\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "Llama 3.2 Vision\u5728\u8f83\u9ad8\u6270\u52a8\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5176\u57fa\u7ebf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8eLLaVA\uff1b\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u76f4\u63a5\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\u662f\u653b\u51fb\u73b0\u4ee3\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cd\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53d7\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u5224\u65ad\u3002"}}

We introduce Re-Depth Anything, a test-time self-supervision framework that bridges this domain gap by fusing DA-V2 with the powerful priors of large-scale 2D diffusion models. Our method performs label-free refinement directly on the input image by re-lighting predicted depth maps and augmenting the input. This re-synthesis method replaces classical photometric reconstruction by leveraging shape from shading (SfS) cues in a new, generative context with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). To prevent optimization collapse, our framework employs a targeted optimization strategy: rather than optimizing depth directly or fine-tuning the full model, we freeze the encoder and only update intermediate embeddings while also fine-tuning the decoder.

However, this field remains underexplored due to the scarcity of reproducible benchmarks and the limitations of existing image composition methods in achieving high-fidelity furniture synthesis while preserving background integrity. To overcome these challenges, we first present RoomBench++, a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark dataset tailored for this task. It consists of 112,851 training pairs and 1,832 testing pairs drawn from both real-world indoor videos and realistic home design renderings, thereby supporting robust training and evaluation under practical conditions. Then, we propose RoomEditor++, a versatile diffusion-based architecture featuring a parameter-sharing dual diffusion backbone, which is compatible with both U-Net and DiT architectures. This design unifies the feature extraction and inpainting processes for reference and background images. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the parameter-sharing mechanism enforces aligned feature representations, facilitating precise geometric transformations, texture preservation, and seamless integration. Extensive experiments validate that RoomEditor++ is superior over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of quantitative metrics, qualitative assessments, and human preference studies, while highlighting its strong generalization to unseen indoor scenes and general scenes without task-specific fine-tuning.

While mainstream video SCI using random binary modulation has demonstrated success, it inevitably results in temporal aliasing during compression. One-hot modulation, activating only one sub-frame per pixel, provides a promising solution for achieving perfect temporal decoupling, thereby alleviating issues associated with aliasing. However, no algorithms currently exist to fully exploit this potential. To bridge this gap, we propose an algorithm specifically designed for one-hot masks. First, leveraging the decoupling properties of one-hot modulation, we transform the reconstruction task into a generative video inpainting problem and introduce a stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the forward process that aligns with the hardware compression process. Next, we identify limitations of the pure diffusion method for video SCI and propose a novel framework that combines one-step regression initialization with one-step diffusion refinement. Furthermore, to mitigate the spatial degradation caused by one-hot modulation, we implement a dual optical path at the hardware level, utilizing complementary information from another path to enhance the inpainted video. To our knowledge, this is the first work integrating diffusion into video SCI reconstruction. Experiments conducted on synthetic datasets and real scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u4e00\u70ed\u8c03\u5236\uff08one-hot modulation\uff09\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5feb\u7167\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\uff08SCI\uff09\u91cd\u5efa\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u968f\u673a\u4e8c\u503c\u8c03\u5236\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u6df7\u53e0\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u4e00\u70ed\u8c03\u5236\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u89e3\u8026\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u91cd\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u8865\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u786c\u4ef6\u538b\u7f29\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u524d\u5411\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u7eaf\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u9891SCI\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u4e00\u6b65\u56de\u5f52\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e0e\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u6563\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u5c42\u9762\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u5149\u8def\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e92\u8865\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u4e00\u70ed\u8c03\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u9000\u5316\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u89c6\u9891SCI\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u4e8c\u503c\u8c03\u5236\u867d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u6df7\u53e0\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u4e00\u70ed\u8c03\u5236\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7406\u60f3\u65f6\u5e8f\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f8\u5e94\u91cd\u5efa\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u53d1\u6325\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u9002\u914d\u4e00\u70ed\u8c03\u5236\u7279\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06\u91cd\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u8865\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u70ed\u8c03\u5236\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u7279\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u786c\u4ef6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u524d\u5411\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08SDE\uff09\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u878d\u5408\u4e00\u6b65\u56de\u5f52\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e0e\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u6563\u7cbe\u4fee\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u7eaf\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b3. \u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u7aef\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5149\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53e6\u4e00\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u5f3a\u8865\u5168\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e00\u70ed\u8c03\u5236\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u9000\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u6d41\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff08SSIM\uff09\u548c\u5cf0\u503c\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\uff08PSNR\uff09\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u5feb\u7167\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u53cc\u5149\u8def\u786c\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e00\u70ed\u8c03\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u52a8\u6001\u6210\u50cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, it remains unclear whether these benchmarks provide data that are sufficiently representative, accessible, and reusable to support clinically meaningful AI. In this work, we assess fairness along two complementary dimensions: (1) whether challenge datasets are representative of real-world clinical diversity, and (2) whether they are accessible and legally reusable in line with the FAIR principles. To address this question, we conducted a large-scale systematic study of 241 biomedical image analysis challenges comprising 458 tasks across 19 imaging modalities. Our findings show substantial biases in dataset composition, including geographic location, modality-, and problem type-related biases, indicating that current benchmarks do not adequately reflect real-world clinical diversity. Despite their widespread influence, challenge datasets were frequently constrained by restrictive or ambiguous access conditions, inconsistent or non-compliant licensing practices, and incomplete documentation, limiting reproducibility and long-term reuse.

Traditional approaches often rely on extensive labeled data and incur high computational costs. Recent tuning-free methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising alternative by leveraging their rich world knowledge. However, these methods typically rely on textual outputs, which introduces information loss, exhibits normalcy bias, and suffers from prompt sensitivity, making them insufficient for capturing subtle anomalous cues. To address these constraints, we propose HeadHunt-VAD, a novel tuning-free VAD paradigm that bypasses textual generation by directly hunting robust anomaly-sensitive internal attention heads within the frozen MLLM. Central to our method is a Robust Head Identification module that systematically evaluates all attention heads using a multi-criteria analysis of saliency and stability, identifying a sparse subset of heads that are consistently discriminative across diverse prompts. Features from these expert heads are then fed into a lightweight anomaly scorer and a temporal locator, enabling efficient and accurate anomaly detection with interpretable outputs. Extensive experiments show that HeadHunt-VAD achieves state-of-the-art performance among tuning-free methods on two major VAD benchmarks while maintaining high efficiency, validating head-level probing in MLLMs as a powerful and practical solution for real-world anomaly detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "HeadHunt-VAD\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u63a2\u6d4b\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u6765\u907f\u514d\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u548c\u6b63\u5e38\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6807\u51c6\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e00\u7ec4\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u5224\u522b\u529b\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5f02\u5e38\u8bc4\u5206\u5668\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eMLLM\u7684\u65e0\u5fae\u8c03\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u3001\u6b63\u5e38\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u654f\u611f\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u5fae\u5f02\u5e38\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHeadHunt-VAD\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9c81\u68d2\u5934\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u5757\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08\u663e\u8457\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7a00\u758f\u5934\uff1b\u63d0\u53d6\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e13\u5bb6\u5934\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5f02\u5e38\u8bc4\u5206\u5668\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cHeadHunt-VAD\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5934\u90e8\u7ea7\u63a2\u67e5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u6316\u6398\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff0cHeadHunt-VAD\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u65e0\u5fae\u8c03\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Recent benchmarks such as BLINK probe visual perception through visual prompting, where questions about visual content are paired with coordinates to which the question refers, with the coordinates explicitly marked in the image itself. While these benchmarks are an important part of VLM evaluation, we find that existing models are surprisingly fragile to seemingly irrelevant details of visual prompting: simply changing a visual marker from red to blue can completely change rankings among models on a leaderboard. By evaluating nine commonly-used open- and closed-source VLMs on two visually prompted tasks, we demonstrate how details in benchmark setup, including visual marker design and dataset size, have a significant influence on model performance and leaderboard rankings. These effects can even be exploited to lift weaker models above stronger ones; for instance, slightly increasing the size of the visual marker results in open-source InternVL3-8B ranking alongside or better than much larger proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro. We further show that low-level inference choices that are often ignored in benchmarking, such as JPEG compression levels in API calls, can also cause model lineup changes.

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "Multi-view 3D object detection is a fundamental task in autonomous driving perception, where achieving a balance between detection accuracy and computational efficiency remains crucial. Sparse query-based 3D detectors efficiently aggregate object-relevant features from multi-view images through a set of learnable queries, offering a concise and end-to-end detection paradigm. Building on this foundation, MV2D leverages 2D detection results to provide high-quality object priors for query initialization, enabling higher precision and recall. However, the inherent depth ambiguity in single-frame 2D detections still limits the accuracy of 3D query generation. To address this issue, we propose StereoMV2D, a unified framework that integrates temporal stereo modeling into the 2D detection-guided multi-view 3D detector. By exploiting cross-temporal disparities of the same object across adjacent frames, StereoMV2D enhances depth perception and refines the query priors, while performing all computations efficiently within 2D regions of interest (RoIs). Furthermore, a dynamic confidence gating mechanism adaptively evaluates the reliability of temporal stereo cues through learning statistical patterns derived from the inter-frame matching matrix together with appearance consistency, ensuring robust detection under object appearance and occlusion. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets demonstrate that StereoMV2D achieves superior detection performance without incurring significant computational overhead.

Existing alignment methods struggle to capture fine-grained correspondences between textual descriptions and visual cues across thousands of patches from a slide, compromising their performance on downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose PathFLIP (Pathology Fine-grained Language-Image Pretraining), a novel framework for holistic WSI interpretation. PathFLIP decomposes slide-level captions into region-level subcaptions and generates text-conditioned region embeddings to facilitate precise visual-language grounding.

Existing methods operate under a closed-world assumption, treating the task as a classification problem over a small, predefined verb set, which struggles to generalize to the long-tail of unseen or ambiguous interactions in the wild. While recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) possess the rich world knowledge required for open-vocabulary understanding, they remain decoupled from existing HOI detectors since fine-tuning them is computationally prohibitive. To address these constraints, we propose \\GRASP-HO}, a novel Generative Reasoning And Steerable Perception framework that reformulates HOI detection from the closed-set classification task to the open-vocabulary generation problem. To bridge the vision and cognitive, we first extract hybrid interaction representations, then design a lightweight learnable cognitive steering conduit (CSC) module to inject the fine-grained visual evidence into a frozen MLLM for effective reasoning. To address the supervision mismatch between classification-based HOI datasets and open-vocabulary generative models, we introduce a hybrid guidance strategy that coupling the language modeling loss and auxiliary classification loss, enabling discriminative grounding without sacrificing generative flexibility.

Nevertheless, shaping such in-context learning for instruction-based video editing is not trivial. Without specifying editing regions, the results can suffer from the problem of inaccurate editing regions and the token interference between editing and non-editing areas during denoising. To address these, we present ReCo, a new instructional video editing paradigm that novelly delves into constraint modeling between editing and non-editing regions during in-context generation. Technically, ReCo width-wise concatenates source and target video for joint denoising. To calibrate video diffusion learning, ReCo capitalizes on two regularization terms, i.e., latent and attention regularization, conducting on one-step backward denoised latents and attention maps, respectively. The former increases the latent discrepancy of the editing region between source and target videos while reducing that of non-editing areas, emphasizing the modification on editing area and alleviating outside unexpected content generation. The latter suppresses the attention of tokens in the editing region to the tokens in counterpart of the source video, thereby mitigating their interference during novel object generation in target video. Furthermore, we propose a large-scale, high-quality video editing dataset, i.e., ReCo-Data, comprising 500K instruction-video pairs to benefit model training.

Schultz", "Birkan Tunc"], "title": "Bitbox: Behavioral Imaging Toolbox for Computational Analysis of Behavior from Videos", "comment": null, "summary": "Computational measurement of human behavior from video has recently become feasible due to major advances in AI. These advances now enable granular and precise quantification of facial expression, head movement, body action, and other behavioral modalities and are increasingly used in psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, and mental health research. However, mainstream adoption remains slow. Most existing methods and software are developed for engineering audiences, require specialized software stacks, and fail to provide behavioral measurements at a level directly useful for hypothesis-driven research. As a result, there is a large barrier to entry for researchers who wish to use modern, AI-based tools in their work. We introduce Bitbox, an open-source toolkit designed to remove this barrier and make advanced computational analysis directly usable by behavioral scientists and clinical researchers. Bitbox is guided by principles of reproducibility, modularity, and interpretability. It provides a standardized interface for extracting high-level behavioral measurements from video, leveraging multiple face, head, and body processors. The core modules have been tested and validated on clinical samples and are designed so that new measures can be added with minimal effort. Bitbox is intended to serve both sides of the translational gap.

It leverages a transformer-based reconstruction model with structured head query tokens as canonical anchor to aggregate flexible input-number-agnostic, camera-pose-free and expression-free inputs into a robust canonical 3D representation. For detailed dynamic deformation, we introduce a lightweight UNet decoder conditioned on UV-space position maps, which can produce detailed expression-dependent deformations in real time. To better capture rare but critical expressions like wrinkles and bared teeth, we also adopt a data distribution adjustment strategy during training to balance the distribution of these expressions in the training set. Moreover, a lightweight 10-second refinement can further enhances identity-specific details in extreme identities without affecting deformation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FlexAvatar achieves superior 3D consistency, detailed dynamic realism compared with previous methods, providing a practical solution for animatable 3D avatar

However, existing datasets are largely limited to either simulated environments or human-driven vehicle data, lacking authentic ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) vehicle behavior under risk conditions. To address this gap, this paper introduces SAVeD, a large-scale video dataset curated from publicly available social media content, explicitly focused on ADAS vehicle-related crashes, near-miss incidents, and disengagements. SAVeD features 2,119 first-person videos, capturing ADAS vehicle operations in diverse locations, lighting conditions, and weather scenarios. The dataset includes video frame-level annotations for collisions, evasive maneuvers, and disengagements, enabling analysis of both perception and decision-making failures. We demonstrate SAVeD's utility through multiple analyses and contributions: (1) We propose a novel framework integrating semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation to compute real-time Time-to-Collision (TTC) for dynamic objects. (2) We utilize the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution to model and quantify the extreme risk in crash and near-miss events across different roadway types.

Multiple instance learning (MIL) offers a solution by treating each WSI as a bag of patch-level instances, but effectively modeling ultra-long sequences with rich spatial context remains difficult. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising alternative for long sequence learning, scaling linearly to thousands of tokens. However, despite its efficiency, it still suffers from limited spatial context modeling and memory decay, constraining its effectiveness to WSI analysis. To address these limitations, we propose MambaMIL+, a new MIL framework that explicitly integrates spatial context while maintaining long-range dependency modeling without memory forgetting. Specifically, MambaMIL+ introduces 1) overlapping scanning, which restructures the patch sequence to embed spatial continuity and instance correlations; 2) a selective stripe position encoder (S2PE) that encodes positional information while mitigating the biases of fixed scanning orders; and 3) a contextual token selection (CTS) mechanism, which leverages supervisory knowledge to dynamically enlarge the contextual memory for stable long-range modeling. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across diagnostic classification, molecular prediction, and survival analysis demonstrate that MambaMIL+ consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance under three feature extractors (ResNet-50, PLIP, and CONCH), highlighting its effectiveness and robustness for large-scale computational pathology", "AI": {"tldr": "MambaMIL+ \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5168\u5207\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\uff08WSI\uff09\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u56e0\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6807\u6ce8\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u53e0\u626b\u63cf\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6761\u7eb9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\uff08S2PE\uff09\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6807\u8bb0\u9009\u62e9\uff08CTS\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfMamba\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8870\u51cf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002\u572820\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMambaMIL+ \u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u4e0b\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u9886\u5148\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u5207\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\uff08WSI\uff09\u5177\u6709\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u6210\u6311\u6218\u3002\u867d\u7136\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MIL\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6bcf\u5f20WSI\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u7ec4\u8865\u4e01\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u8d85\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u96be\u9898\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1Mamba\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7ebf\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4fdd\u6301\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728WSI\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "MambaMIL+ \u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6539\u8fdb\uff1a1\uff09\u91cd\u53e0\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u91cd\u6784\u8865\u4e01\u5e8f\u5217\u4ee5\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6761\u7eb9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\uff08S2PE\uff09\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u56fa\u5b9a\u626b\u63cf\u987a\u5e8f\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff1b3\uff09\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6807\u8bb0\u9009\u62e9\uff08CTS\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u77e5\u8bc6\u52a8\u6001\u6269\u5c55\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u572820\u4e2a\u6db5\u76d6\u8bca\u65ad\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u5206\u5b50\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMambaMIL+ \u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff08ResNet-50\u3001PLIP\u3001CONCH\uff09\u4e0b\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8ba1\u7b97\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MambaMIL+ \u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4fdd\u6301\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6548\u7387\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86WSI\u5206\u6790\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A key challenge is generalization, as detectors trained on a narrow class of generators often fail when confronted with unseen models. In this work, we address the pressing need for generalizable detection by leveraging large vision-language models, specifically CLIP, to identify synthetic content across diverse generative techniques. First, we introduce Diff-Gen, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 100k diffusion-generated fakes that capture broad spectral artifacts unlike traditional GAN datasets. Models trained on Diff-Gen demonstrate stronger cross-domain generalization, particularly on previously unseen image generators. Second, we propose AdaptPrompt, a parameter-efficient transfer learning framework that jointly learns task-specific textual prompts and visual adapters while keeping the CLIP backbone frozen. We further show via layer ablation that pruning the final transformer block of the vision encoder enhances the retention of high-frequency generative artifacts, significantly boosting detection accuracy. Our evaluation spans 25 challenging test sets, covering synthetic content generated by GANs, diffusion models, and commercial tools, establishing a new state-of-the-art in both standard and cross-domain scenarios.

However, cloud contamination frequently obscures LST observations, limiting their usability for continuous SUHI analysis. Most existing LST reconstruction methods rely on multitemporal information or multisensor data fusion, requiring auxiliary observations that may be unavailable or unreliable under persistent cloud cover. Purely spatial gap-filling approaches offer an alternative, but traditional statistical methods degrade under large or spatially contiguous gaps, while many deep learning based spatial models deteriorate rapidly with increasing missingness.\n  Recent advances in denoising diffusion based image inpainting models have demonstrated improved robustness under high missingness, motivating their adoption for spatial LST reconstruction. In this work, we introduce UrbanDIFF, a purely spatial denoising diffusion model for reconstructing cloud contaminated urban LST imagery. The model is conditioned on static urban structure information, including built-up surface data and a digital elevation model, and enforces strict consistency with revealed cloud free pixels through a supervised pixel guided refinement step during inference.\n  UrbanDIFF is trained and evaluated using NASA MODIS Terra LST data from seven major United States metropolitan areas spanning 2002 to 2025. Experiments using synthetic cloud masks with 20 to 85 percent coverage show that UrbanDIFF consistently outperforms an interpolation baseline, particularly under dense cloud occlusion, achieving SSIM of 0.89, RMSE of 1.2 K, and R2 of 0.84 at 85 percent cloud coverage, while exhibiting slower performance degradation as cloud density increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "UrbanDIFF\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7eaf\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u53d7\u4e91\u6c61\u67d3\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u90fd\u5e02\u5730\u8868\u6e29\u5ea6\uff08LST\uff09\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u9759\u6001\u57ce\u5e02\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u5efa\u7b51\u7528\u5730\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u9ad8\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u50cf\u7d20\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7cbe\u70bc\u6b65\u9aa4\u786e\u4fdd\u4e0e\u672a\u88ab\u906e\u6321\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e3b\u8981\u90fd\u5e02\u533a\u7684NASA MODIS Terra LST\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u572820%\u81f385%\u5408\u6210\u4e91\u8986\u76d6\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u63d2\u503c\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u4e91\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c85%\u4e91\u8986\u76d6\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230SSIM 0.89\u3001RMSE 1.2 K\u3001R\u00b2 0.84\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u4e91\u5bc6\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u4e0b\u964d\u66f4\u7f13\u6162\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LST\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u65f6\u76f8\u6216\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u4e91\u8986\u76d6\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u7a7a\u95f4\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u6216\u8fde\u7eed\u7f3a\u5931\u533a\u57df\u6548\u679c\u5dee\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u56e0\u7f3a\u5931\u7387\u4e0a\u5347\u800c\u6027\u80fd\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u9ad8\u4e91\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4e0b\u4ecd\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u7eaf\u7a7a\u95f4\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUrbanDIFF\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9759\u6001\u57ce\u5e02\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u76d1\u7763\u50cf\u7d20\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7cbe\u70bc\u6b65\u9aa4\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u65e0\u4e91\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u8865\u5168\u3002", "result": "\u572820%-85%\u4e91\u8986\u76d6\u4e0b\uff0cUrbanDIFF\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u572885%\u4e91\u8986\u76d6\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08SSIM 0.89\uff0cRMSE 1.2 K\uff0cR\u00b2 0.84\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u8f83\u6162\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "UrbanDIFF\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u5730\u8868\u6e29\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7eaf\u7a7a\u95f4\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e91\u8986\u76d6\u4e25\u91cd\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8f85\u52a9\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u9614\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

We address this gap by introducing Chorus, a multi-teacher pretraining framework that learns a holistic feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene encoder by distilling complementary signals from 2D foundation models. Chorus employs a shared 3D encoder and teacher-specific projectors to learn from language-aligned, generalist, and object-aware teachers, encouraging a shared embedding space that captures signals from high-level semantics to fine-grained structure.\n  We evaluate Chorus on a wide range of tasks: open-vocabulary semantic and instance segmentation, linear and decoder probing, as well as data-efficient supervision. Besides 3DGS, we also test Chorus on several benchmarks that only support point clouds by pretraining a variant using only Gaussians' centers, colors, estimated normals as inputs.

However, the fundamental design choice of diffusing data all the way to white noise and then reconstructing it leads to an extremely difficult and computationally intractable prediction task. To overcome this limitation, we propose InSPECT (Invariant Spectral Feature-Preserving Diffusion Model), a novel diffusion model that keeps invariant spectral features during both the forward and backward processes. At the end of the forward process, the Fourier coefficients smoothly converge to a specified random noise, enabling features preservation while maintaining diversity and randomness. By preserving invariant features, InSPECT demonstrates enhanced visual diversity, faster convergence rate, and a smoother diffusion process. Experiments on CIFAR-10, Celeb-A, and LSUN demonstrate that InSPECT achieves on average a 39.23% reduction in FID and 45.80% improvement in IS against DDPM for 10K iterations under specified parameter settings, which demonstrates the significant advantages of preserving invariant features: achieving superior generation quality and diversity, while enhancing computational efficiency and enabling faster convergence rate.

With the advance of general purpose foundation models based on Vision Transformers (ViTs), this impracticability becomes even more problematic. Therefore, new methods are necessary to provide transparency and reliability to ViT-based foundation models. In this work, we present a new method for turning any well-trained ViT-based model into a SEM without retraining, which we call Keypoint Counting Classifiers (KCCs). Recent works have shown that ViTs can automatically identify matching keypoints between images with high precision, and we build on these results to create an easily interpretable decision process that is inherently visualizable in the input. We perform an extensive evaluation which show that KCCs improve the human-machine communication compared to recent baselines. We believe that KCCs constitute an important step towards making ViT-based foundation models more transparent and reliable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5c06\u4efb\u4f55\u5df2\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u538b\u5668\uff08ViT\uff09\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\uff08SEMs\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u8ba1\u6570\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff08KCCs\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528ViT\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u95f4\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u5339\u914d\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u76f4\u89c2\u4e14\u53ef\u89c6\u89c9\u5316\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4eba\u673a\u6c9f\u901a\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u7684\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u6108\u53d1\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347ViT\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eViT\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u56fe\u50cf\u95f4\u5339\u914d\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u73b0\u6709ViT\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u8ba1\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cKCCs\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6c9f\u901a\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f7fViT\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5177\u900f\u660e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "KCCs\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5411\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

While humans naturally coordinate in groups, modeling such interactions remains difficult due to long temporal horizons, strong inter-agent dependencies, and variable group sizes. Existing motion generation methods are largely task-specific and do not generalize to flexible multi-agent generation. We introduce MAGNet (Multi-Agent Diffusion Forcing Transformer), a unified autoregressive diffusion framework for multi-agent motion generation that supports a wide range of interaction tasks through flexible conditioning and sampling. MAGNet performs dyadic prediction, partner inpainting, and full multi-agent motion generation within a single model, and can autoregressively generate ultra-long sequences spanning hundreds of v. Building on Diffusion Forcing, we introduce key modifications that explicitly model inter-agent coupling during autoregressive denoising, enabling coherent coordination across agents. As a result, MAGNet captures both tightly synchronized activities (e.g, dancing, boxing) and loosely structured social interactions. Our approach performs on par with specialized methods on dyadic benchmarks while naturally extending to polyadic scenarios involving three or more interacting people, enabled by a scalable architecture that is agnostic to the number of agents. We refer readers to the supplemental video, where the temporal dynamics and spatial coordination of generated interactions are best appreciated.

However, current digital twins remain largely static and are limited to navigation and view synthesis without embodied interactivity. To bridge this gap, we introduce Dexterous World Model (DWM), a scene-action-conditioned video diffusion framework that models how dexterous human actions induce dynamic changes in static 3D scenes.\n  Given a static 3D scene rendering and an egocentric hand motion sequence, DWM generates temporally coherent videos depicting plausible human-scene interactions. Our approach conditions video generation on (1) static scene renderings following a specified camera trajectory to ensure spatial consistency, and (2) egocentric hand mesh renderings that encode both geometry and motion cues to model action-conditioned dynamics directly. To train DWM, we construct a hybrid interaction video dataset. Synthetic egocentric interactions provide fully aligned supervision for joint locomotion and manipulation learning, while fixed-camera real-world videos contribute diverse and realistic object dynamics.\n  Experiments demonstrate that DWM enables realistic and physically plausible interactions, such as grasping, opening, and moving objects, while maintaining camera and scene consistency. This framework represents a first step toward video diffusion-based interactive digital twins and enables embodied simulation from egocentric actions.", "AI": {"tldr": "DWM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u573a\u666f-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u9759\u60013D\u573a\u666f\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u624b\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5408\u6210\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4ea4\u4e92\u6570\u636e\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u51fa\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6293\u53d6\u3001\u5f00\u5408\u3001\u79fb\u52a8\u7b49\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5177\u8eab\u4eff\u771f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5177\u8eab\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u52a8\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u4f5c\u5982\u4f55\u52a8\u6001\u6539\u53d8\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u3002", "method": "DWM\u91c7\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u9759\u60013D\u573a\u666f\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u624b\u90e8\u7f51\u683c\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u89c6\u9891\u3002\u5229\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u878d\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u89c6\u9891\u589e\u5f3a\u7269\u4f53\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDWM\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u673a\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6293\u53d6\u3001\u6253\u5f00\u3001\u79fb\u52a8\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\u3002", "conclusion": "DWM\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u4e3a\u5177\u8eab\u4eff\u771f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

To unify vision generation and understanding, a burgeoning trend is to adopt high-dimensional features from representation encoders as generative latents. However, we empirically identify two fundamental obstacles in this paradigm: (1) the discriminative feature space lacks compact regularization, making diffusion models prone to off-manifold latents that lead to inaccurate object structures; and (2) the encoder's inherently weak pixel-level reconstruction hinders the generator from learning accurate fine-grained geometry and texture. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework to adapt understanding-oriented encoder features for generative tasks. We introduce a semantic-pixel reconstruction objective to regularize the latent space, enabling the compression of both semantic information and fine-grained details into a highly compact representation (96 channels with 16x16 spatial downsampling). This design ensures that the latent space remains semantically rich and achieves state-of-the-art image reconstruction, while remaining compact enough for accurate generation. Leveraging this representation, we design a unified Text-to-Image (T2I) and image editing model. Benchmarking against various feature spaces, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction, faster convergence, and substantial performance gains in both T2I and editing tasks, validating that representation encoders can be effectively adapted into robust generative components.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9762\u5411\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u9002\u914d\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7d27\u51d1\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u91cd\u5efa\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49-\u50cf\u7d20\u91cd\u5efa\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b096\u901a\u9053\u300116\u00d716\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u5bcc\u542b\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u3002\u8be5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u9886\u5148\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u8868\u793a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7d27\u51d1\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u79bb\u66fc\u8fbe\u7279\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7269\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u672c\u8eab\u50cf\u7d20\u91cd\u5efa\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cbe\u7ec6\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u7eb9\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49-\u50cf\u7d20\u91cd\u5efa\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a96\u901a\u9053\u300116\u00d716\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u4e0e\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8868\u793a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49-\u50cf\u7d20\u91cd\u5efa\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u7406\u89e3\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u517c\u5177\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u4e0e\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}
