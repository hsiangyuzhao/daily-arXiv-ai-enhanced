However, spatial reasoning:a fundamental component of human cognition that includes mental rotation, navigation, and spatial relationship comprehension remains a significant challenge for current advanced VLMs. We hypothesize that imagination, the internal simulation of spatial states, is the dominant reasoning mechanism within a spatial world model. To test this hypothesis and systematically probe current VLM spatial reasoning mechanisms, we introduce SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark that jointly measures spatial reasoning accuracy and reasoning efficiency. Comprehensive experiments reveal three key findings. First, advanced VLMs predominantly rely on linguistic representations for reasoning and imagination, resulting in significant deficiencies on visual centric tasks that demand perceptual spatial relations and 3D geometry transformations such as mental rotation or projection prediction. Second, advanced VLMs exhibit severe inefficiency in their current spatial reasoning mechanisms, with token usage growing rapidly as transformation complexity increases. Third, we propose an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training, which can implicitly construct an internal world model that is critical for spatial reasoning in VLMs. Building on SpatiaLite, this work delineates the spatial reasoning limits and patterns of advanced VLMs, identifies key shortcomings, and informs future advances", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faSpatiaLite\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u5f81\u800c\u975e\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u6d89\u53ca3D\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u610f\u8c61\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff08IDF\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u5185\u90e8\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5148\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u4e09\u7ef4\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\u3001\u5fc3\u7406\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5185\u5728\u7684\u60f3\u8c61\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SpatiaLite\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u5408\u6210\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8054\u5408\u6d4b\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709VLMs\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u610f\u8c61\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff08IDF\uff09\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5185\u90e8\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1\uff09\u5148\u8fdbVLMs\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\uff1b2\uff09\u5176\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6548\u7387\u6781\u4f4e\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4ee4\u724c\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u6025\u5267\u4e0a\u5347\uff1b3\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u7684IDF\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5185\u90e8\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5148\u8fdbVLMs\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u800c\u975e\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u610f\u8c61\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u5f0f\u6784\u5efa\u5185\u90e8\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

They assumed that the SCMs were learned from purely observational data, leading to an imprecise characterization of the marginal distributions of exogenous variables. Their method leveraged the canonical representation of structural equations to decompose a general SCM with high-cardinality exogenous variables into a set of sub-models with low-cardinality exogenous variables. These sub-models had precise marginals over the exogenous variables and therefore admitted efficient exact inference. The aggregated results were used to bound counterfactual probabilities in the original model. The approach was developed for Markovian models, where each exogenous variable affects only a single endogenous variable. In this paper, we investigate extending the methodology to \\textit{semi-Markovian} SCMs, where exogenous variables may influence multiple endogenous variables. Such models are capable of representing confounding relationships that Markovian models cannot. We illustrate the challenges of this extension using a minimal example, which motivates a set of alternative solution strategies. These strategies are evaluated both theoretically and through a computational study.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5c06Bj\u00f8ru\u7b49\u4eba\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u6cbb\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ece\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff08SCM\uff09\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u534a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592bSCM\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u80fd\u8868\u793a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7684\u6df7\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u6700\u5c0f\u793a\u4f8b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6269\u5c55\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u82e5\u5e72\u66ff\u4ee3\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u6cbb\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592bSCM\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u591a\u7aef\u70b9\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u534a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8868\u793a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7684\u6df7\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u62d3\u5c55\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5c0f\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u793a\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\u6269\u5c55\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u79cd\u66ff\u4ee3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u6784\u3001\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u89e3\u4f18\u5316\u53ca\u8fb9\u754c\u805a\u5408\u673a\u5236\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u548c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u534a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u6df7\u6742\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u7d27\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u539f\u5206\u6cbb\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u534a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592bSCM\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u6df7\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002"}}

With watermarking, we can always accurately detect LLM-generated texts. However, recent findings suggest that these techniques often negatively affect the quality of the generated texts, and adversarial attacks can strip the watermarking signals, causing the texts to possibly evade detection. These findings have created resistance in the wide adoption of watermarking by LLM creators. Finally, to encourage adoption, we evaluate the robustness of several watermarking techniques to adversarial attacks by comparing paraphrasing and back translation (i.e., English $\\to$ another language $\\to$ English) attacks; and their ability to preserve quality and writing style of the unwatermarked texts by using linguistic metrics to capture quality and writing style of texts. Our results suggest that these watermarking techniques preserve semantics, deviate from the writing style of the unwatermarked texts, and are susceptible to adversarial attacks, especially for the back translation attack.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u6539\u5199\u548c\u53cd\u5411\u7ffb\u8bd1\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5199\u4f5c\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u867d\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u539f\u59cb\u5199\u4f5c\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u4e14\u6613\u53d7\u53cd\u5411\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7b49\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7eb3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u7f13\u89e3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5371\u5bb3\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u5d4c\u5165\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u53ca\u6613\u88ab\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u53bb\u9664\u6c34\u5370\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u4fdd\u8d28\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u843d\u5730\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6539\u5199\u548c\u53cd\u5411\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff08\u82f1\u2192\u5176\u4ed6\u8bed\u8a00\u2192\u82f1\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u6307\u6807\u8861\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5199\u4f5c\u98ce\u683c\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u6587\u672c\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u867d\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u663e\u8457\u504f\u79bb\u539f\u5199\u4f5c\u98ce\u683c\uff1b\u4e14\u5728\u53cd\u5411\u7ffb\u8bd1\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u6781\u6613\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u5e7f\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u66f4\u9690\u853d\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Due to the lack of standardized, large-scale, and thoroughly verified datasets to facilitate learning of meaningful intermediate representations, such as bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, closed-loop E2E models remain far behind even simple rule-based baselines. To address this challenge, we introduce nuCarla, a large-scale, nuScenes-style BEV perception dataset built within the CARLA simulator. nuCarla features (1) full compatibility with the nuScenes format, enabling seamless transfer of real-world perception models; (2) a dataset scale comparable to nuScenes, but with more balanced class distributions; (3) direct usability for closed-loop simulation deployment; and (4) high-performance BEV backbones that achieve state-of-the-art detection results.

However, LVLMs are highly vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks. This paper systematically analyzes the vulnerabilities of LVLMs integrated in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) under carefully crafted jailbreaking attacks. First, we carefully construct a dataset with harmful queries relevant to transportation, following OpenAI's prohibited categories to which the LVLMs should not respond. Second, we introduce a novel jailbreaking attack that exploits the vulnerabilities of LVLMs through image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting. Third, we propose a multi-layered response filtering defense technique to prevent the model from generating inappropriate responses. We perform extensive experiments with the proposed attack and defense on the state-of-the-art LVLMs (both open-source and closed-source). To evaluate the attack method and defense technique, we use GPT-4's judgment to determine the toxicity score of the generated responses, as well as manual verification.

However, when unknown samples are semantically similar to known classes, inter-class overlap in the feature space often causes models to assign unjustifiably high confidence to them, leading to misclassification as known classes -- a phenomenon known as overconfidence. This overconfidence undermines OSR by blurring the decision boundary between known and unknown classes. To address this issue, we propose a framework that explicitly mitigates overconfidence caused by inter-class overlap. The framework consists of two components: a perturbation-based uncertainty estimation module, which applies controllable parameter perturbations to generate diverse predictions and quantify predictive uncertainty, and an unknown detection module with distinct learning-based classifiers, implemented as a two-stage procedure, which leverages the estimated uncertainty to improve discrimination between known and unknown classes, thereby enhancing OSR performance.

State-of-the-art (SOTA) TRL methods transform raw GPS trajectories to grid or road trajectories to capture high-level travel semantics, i.e., regions and roads. However, they lose fine-grained spatial-temporal details as multiple GPS points are grouped into a single grid cell or road segment. To tackle this problem, we propose the BLUrred Encoding method, dubbed BLUE, which gradually reduces the precision of GPS coordinates to create hierarchical patches with multiple levels. The low-level patches are small and preserve fine-grained spatial-temporal details, while the high-level patches are large and capture overall travel patterns. To complement different patch levels with each other, our BLUE is an encoder-decoder model with a pyramid structure. At each patch level, a Transformer is used to learn the trajectory embedding at the current level, while pooling prepares inputs for the higher level in the encoder, and up-resolution provides guidance for the lower level in the decoder. BLUE is trained using the trajectory reconstruction task with the MSE loss. We compare BLUE with 8 SOTA TRL methods for 3 downstream tasks, the results show that BLUE consistently achieves higher accuracy than all baselines, outperforming the best-performing baselines by an average of 30.90%.

Pattern-matching systems can encounter issues where exponential time and space are required to find matches for rules with many underconstrained variables, or which produce combinatorial intermediate partial matches (but are otherwise well-constrained). When online AI systems automatically generate rules from example-driven induction or code synthesis, they can easily produce worst-case matching patterns that slow or halt program execution by exceeding available memory. In our own work with cognitive systems that learn from example, we've found that aggressive forms of anti-unification-based generalization can easily produce these circumstances. To make these systems practical without hand-engineering constraints or succumbing to unpredictable failure modes, we introduce a new matching algorithm called CORGI (Collection-Oriented Relational Graph Iteration). Unlike RETE-based approaches, CORGI offers quadratic time and space guarantees for finding single satisficing matches, and the ability to iteratively stream subsequent matches without committing entire conflict sets to memory. CORGI differs from RETE in that it does not have a traditional $\u03b2$-memory for collecting partial matches. Instead, CORGI takes a two-step approach: a graph of grounded relations is built/maintained in a forward pass, and an iterator generates matches as needed by working backward through the graph. This approach eliminates the high-latency delays and memory overflows that can result from populating full conflict sets.

We investigate a simple training-free approach - QE-informed Retranslation, and compare it with another within the same training-free paradigm. Our winning approach selects the highest-quality translation from multiple candidates generated by different LLMs. The second approach, more akin to APE, instructs an LLM to replace error substrings as specified in the provided QE explanation(s). A conditional heuristic was employed to minimise the number of edits, with the aim of maximising the Gain-to-Edit ratio.

This task presents key challenges, including maintaining temporal consistency across frames affected by occlusion and appearance variations, and achieving novel object generalization without relying on complex region proposals, which are often computationally expensive and require task-specific training. Our novel object-aware temporal modeling approach addresses these challenges by incorporating a filtering mechanism that selectively propagates high-confidence object features across frames. This enables efficient feature progression, reduces noise accumulation, and enhances detection accuracy in a few-shot setting. By utilizing few-shot trained detection and classification heads with focused feature propagation, we achieve robust temporal consistency without depending on explicit object tube proposals. Our approach achieves performance gains, with AP improvements of 3.7% (FSVOD-500), 5.3% (FSYTV-40), 4.3% (VidOR), and 4.5 (VidVRD) in the 5-shot setting. Further results demonstrate improvements in 1-shot, 3-shot, and 10-shot configurations.

However, acquiring such datasets is difficult because capturing accident-triggering scenarios as they occur is nearly impossible. To overcome this limitation, this study presents a novel scene graph-guided generative AI framework that synthesizes photorealistic images of hazardous scenarios grounded in historical Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) accident reports. OSHA narratives are analyzed using GPT-4o to extract structured hazard reasoning, which is converted into object-level scene graphs capturing spatial and contextual relationships essential for understanding risk. These graphs guide a text-to-image diffusion model to generate compositionally accurate hazard scenes. To evaluate the realism and semantic fidelity of the generated data, a visual question answering (VQA) framework is introduced.

A Study on GM-Extract and Mitigations", "comment": "To be submitted for publication", "summary": "The diminishing ability of large language models (LLMs) to effectively utilize long-range context-the \"lost-in-the-middle\" phenomenon-poses a significant challenge in retrieval-based LLM applications. To study the impact of this phenomenon in a real-world application setting, we introduce GM-Extract, a novel benchmark dataset meticulously designed to evaluate LLM performance on retrieval of control variables. To accurately diagnose failure modes, we propose a simple yet elegant evaluation system using two distinct metrics: one for spatial retrieval capability (Document Metric) and the other for semantic retrieval capability (Variable Extraction Metric). We conduct a systematic evaluation of 7-8B parameter models on two multi-document tasks (key-value extraction and question-answering), demonstrating a significant change in retrieval performance simply by altering how the data is represented in the context window. While a distinct U-shaped curve was not consistently observed, our analysis reveals a clear pattern of performance across models, which we further correlate with perplexity scores. Furthermore, we perform a literature survey of mitigation methods, which we categorize into two distinct approaches: black-box and white-box methods. We then apply these techniques to our benchmark, finding that their efficacy is highly nuanced. Our evaluation highlights scenarios where these strategies successfully improve performance, as well as surprising cases where they lead to a negative impact, providing a comprehensive understanding of their utility in a practical context.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGM-Extract\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u68c0\u7d22\uff08\u6587\u6863\u5ea6\u91cf\uff09\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u68c0\u7d22\uff08\u53d8\u91cf\u63d0\u53d6\u5ea6\u91cf\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u6307\u6807\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u672a\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e00\u81f4\u7684U\u5f62\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u53d8\u5316\u4e0e\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u6587\u732e\u8c03\u7814\u8868\u660e\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5206\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u4e0e\u767d\u76d2\u4e24\u7c7b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5176\u6548\u679c\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u8d1f\u9762\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u51fa\u73b0\u7684'\u8ff7\u5931\u4e8e\u4e2d\u95f4'\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u56e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fc7\u957f\u5bfc\u81f4\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u53ca\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaGM-Extract\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\uff08\u6587\u6863\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0e\u53d8\u91cf\u63d0\u53d6\u5ea6\u91cf\uff09\uff0c\u5bf97-8B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6587\u6863\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u952e\u503c\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u95ee\u7b54\uff09\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u6027\u80fd\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u68b3\u7406\u5e76\u5206\u7c7b\u73b0\u6709\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u4e0e\u767d\u76d2\u4e24\u7c7b\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5728\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u636e\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u6027\u80fd\u53d8\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e0e\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u5448\u4e00\u5b9a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b\u9ed1\u76d2\u4e0e\u767d\u76d2\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u5404\u5f02\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u751a\u81f3\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u5176\u9002\u7528\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5177\u4f53\u60c5\u5883\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u91cd\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u975e\u666e\u9002\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u9700\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u8c28\u614e\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6df1\u5165\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u660e\u786e\u3002"}}

While generative methods provide a unified modeling perspective, they often suffer from slow inference due to the complex sampling trajectories from noise to image. To address this, we formulate image fusion as a direct probabilistic transport from source modalities to the fused image distribution, leveraging the flow matching paradigm to improve sampling efficiency and structural consistency. To mitigate the lack of high-quality fused images for supervision, we collect fusion results from multiple state-of-the-art models as priors, and employ a task-aware selection function to select the most reliable pseudo-labels for each task. We further introduce a Fusion Refiner module that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to systematically identify, decompose, and enhance degraded components in selected pseudo-labels. For multi-task scenarios, we integrate elastic weight consolidation and experience replay mechanisms to preserve cross-task performance and enhance continual learning ability from both parameter stability and memory retention perspectives. Our approach achieves competitive performance across diverse fusion tasks, while significantly improving sampling efficiency and maintaining a lightweight model design.

Zhixuan Zeng", "Yuhao Chen", "Alexander Wong"], "title": "SCALEX: Scalable Concept and Latent Exploration for Diffusion Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Image generation models frequently encode social biases, including stereotypes tied to gender, race, and profession. Existing methods for analyzing these biases in diffusion models either focus narrowly on predefined categories or depend on manual interpretation of latent directions. These constraints limit scalability and hinder the discovery of subtle or unanticipated patterns.\n  We introduce SCALEX, a framework for scalable and automated exploration of diffusion model latent spaces. SCALEX extracts semantically meaningful directions from H-space using only natural language prompts, enabling zero-shot interpretation without retraining or labelling. This allows systematic comparison across arbitrary concepts and large-scale discovery of internal model associations. We show that SCALEX detects gender bias in profession prompts, ranks semantic alignment across identity descriptors, and reveals clustered conceptual structure without supervision. By linking prompts to latent directions directly, SCALEX makes bias analysis in diffusion models more scalable, interpretable, and extensible than prior approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "SCALEX \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u63a2\u7d22\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u4ece H-space \u63d0\u53d6\u8bed\u4e49\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u6807\u6ce8\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u6bd4\u8f83\u4efb\u610f\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u804c\u4e1a\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u6392\u5e8f\u8eab\u4efd\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u6982\u5ff5\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u6790\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u624b\u52a8\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5e76\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u7ec6\u5fae\u6216\u610f\u5916\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "method": "SCALEX \u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u4ece H-space \u63d0\u53d6\u8bed\u4e49\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "SCALEX \u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u6d4b\u804c\u4e1a\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5bf9\u8eab\u4efd\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63ed\u793a\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u504f\u89c1\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u65b9\u5411\u5173\u8054\uff0cSCALEX \u4f7f\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u5206\u6790\u6bd4\u4ee5\u5f80\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

To address the limitations associated with trajectory acquisition and vehicle tracking, road segment maps recording the individual-level traffic dynamic data were directly served in crash detection. A novel two-stage trajectory-free crash detection framework, was present to generate the rational future road segment map and identify crashes. The first-stage diffusion-based segment map generation model, Mapfusion, conducts a noisy-to-normal process that progressively adds noise to the road segment map until the map is corrupted to pure Gaussian noise. The denoising process is guided by sequential embedding components capturing the temporal dynamics of segment map sequences. Furthermore, the generation model is designed to incorporate background context through ControlNet to enhance generation control. Crash detection is achieved by comparing the monitored segment map with the generations from diffusion model in second stage. Trained on non-crash vehicle motion data, Mapfusion successfully generates realistic road segment evolution maps based on learned motion patterns and remains robust across different sampling intervals.

However, existing methods struggle with challenges of scalability and retrieval efficiency, particularly when handling complex, multi-hop questions that require multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ALEX (A Light Editing-knowledge Extractor), a lightweight knowledge editing framework. The core innovation of ALEX is its hierarchical memory architecture, which organizes knowledge updates (edits) into semantic clusters. This design fundamentally reduces retrieval complexity from a linear O(N) to a highly scalable O(K+N/C). Furthermore, the framework integrates an Inferential Query Synthesis (IQS) module to bridge the semantic gap between queries and facts , and a Dynamic Evidence Adjudication (DEA) engine that executes an efficient two-stage retrieval process. Experiments on the MQUAKE benchmark demonstrate that ALEX significantly improves both the accuracy of multi-hop answers (MultiHop-ACC) and the reliability of reasoning paths (HopWise-ACC). It also reduces the required search space by over 80% , presenting a promising path toward building scalable, efficient, and accurate knowledge editing systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "ALEX \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u8bb0\u5fc6\u67b6\u6784\u5c06\u77e5\u8bc6\u66f4\u65b0\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u7c07\uff0c\u5c06\u68c0\u7d22\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4ece\u7ebf\u6027 O(N) \u964d\u4f4e\u81f3\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684 O(K+N/C)\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\uff08IQS\uff09\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8bc1\u636e\u4ef2\u88c1\uff08DEA\uff09\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u8d85\u8fc7 80% \u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u800c LLMs \u7684\u9759\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa ALEX \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u8bb0\u5fc6\u67b6\u6784\u5bf9\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\uff08IQS\uff09\u6a21\u5757\u4ee5\u5f25\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u8bc1\u636e\u4ef2\u88c1\uff08DEA\uff09\u5f15\u64ce\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9ad8\u6548\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728 MQUAKE \u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cALEX \u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u8df3\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08MultiHop-ACC\uff09\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff08HopWise-ACC\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6240\u9700\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u8d85\u8fc7 80%\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "ALEX \u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u590d\u6742\u77e5\u8bc6\u66f4\u65b0\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

However, seismic data presents unique characteristics that require specialized processing techniques for pretraining foundation models in seismic contexts with high- and low-frequency features playing crucial roles. Existing vision transformers (ViTs) with sequential tokenization ignore the intrinsic pattern and fail to grasp both the high- and low-frequency seismic information efficiently and effectively. This work introduces a novel adaptive two-grid foundation model training strategy (ADATG) with Hilbert encoding specifically tailored for seismogram data, leveraging the hierarchical structures inherent in seismic data. Specifically, our approach employs spectrum decomposition to separate high- and low-frequency components and utilizes hierarchical Hilbert encoding to represent the data effectively. Moreover, observing the frequency principle observed in ViTs, we propose an adaptive training strategy that initially emphasizes coarse-level information and then progressively refines the model's focus on fine-level features. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our training methods. This research highlights the importance of data encoding and training strategies informed by the distinct characteristics of high- and low-frequency features in seismic images, ultimately contributing to the enhancement of visual seismic foundation models pretraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5730\u9707\u6ce2\u5f62\u6570\u636e\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53cc\u7f51\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff08ADATG\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u89e3\u5206\u79bb\u9ad8\u4f4e\u9891\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7f16\u7801\u6709\u6548\u8868\u793a\u6570\u636e\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u9891\u7387\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5148\u5173\u6ce8\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u518d\u9010\u6b65\u805a\u7126\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5730\u9707\u6570\u636e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u4f4e\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5730\u9707\u6570\u636e\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u9ad8\u4f4e\u9891\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08ViTs\uff09\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u5730\u9707\u6570\u636e\u7279\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faADATG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u89e3\u4ee5\u5206\u79bb\u9ad8\u4f4e\u9891\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5206\u5c42\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7f16\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u7387\u539f\u7406\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5148\u5173\u6ce8\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u540e\u9010\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5730\u9707\u6570\u636e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u5730\u9707\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5730\u9707\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9ad8\u4f4e\u9891\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5408\u7406\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u5730\u9707\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5730\u9707\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Recent studies demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs can accurately predict vehicle trajectories and lane-change intentions by gathering and transforming data from surrounding vehicles. However, the robustness of such LLM-based prediction models for safety-critical driving systems remains unexplored, despite the increasing concerns about the trustworthiness of LLMs. This study addresses this gap by conducting a systematic vulnerability analysis of LLM-enabled vehicle trajectory prediction. We propose a one-feature differential evolution attack that perturbs a single kinematic feature of surrounding vehicles within the LLM's input prompts under a black-box setting. Experiments on the highD dataset reveal that even minor, physically plausible perturbations can significantly disrupt model outputs, underscoring the susceptibility of LLM-based predictors to adversarial manipulation. Further analyses reveal a trade-off between accuracy and robustness, examine the failure mechanism, and explore potential mitigation solutions. The findings provide the very first insights into adversarial vulnerabilities of LLM-driven automated vehicle models in the context of vehicular interactions and highlight the need for robustness-oriented design in future LLM-based intelligent transportation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5355\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5206\u8fdb\u5316\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u9ed1\u76d2\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5bf9\u5468\u56f4\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u5c0f\u4f46\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u7684\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6b64\u7c7b\u6270\u52a8\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u7834\u574f\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8f66\u9645\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5931\u6548\u673a\u5236\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6f5c\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u672a\u6765LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u4ee5\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e3a\u5bfc\u5411\u8fdb\u884c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5355\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5206\u8fdb\u5316\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5468\u56f4\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5728\u9ed1\u76d2\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728highD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5fae\u5c0f\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u4e5f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86LLM-based\u8f66\u8f86\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u6548\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8f66\u9645\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5fc5\u987b\u5728\u672a\u6765\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\u8fd0\u884c\u3002"}}

While the role of AI in such situations is gaining attention for making optimal decisions within limited resources and time, its development and performance evaluation require benchmark datasets of sufficient quantity and quality. However, MCIs occur infrequently, and sufficient records are difficult to accumulate at the scene, making it challenging to collect large-scale realworld data for research use. Therefore, we developed Syn-STARTS, a framework that uses LLMs to generate triage cases, and verified its effectiveness. The results showed that the triage cases generated by Syn-STARTS were qualitatively indistinguishable from the TRIAGE open dataset generated by manual curation from training materials. Furthermore, when evaluating the LLM accuracy using hundreds of cases each from the green, yellow, red, and black categories defined by the standard triage method START, the results were found to be highly stable. This strongly indicates the possibility of synthetic data in developing high-performance AI models for severe and critical medical situations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u5408\u6210\u4e09\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6Syn-STARTS\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4f24\u4ea1\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08MCIs\uff09\u4e2d\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e09\u5206\u7c7b\u6848\u4f8b\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684TRIAGE\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u7eff\u3001\u9ec4\u3001\u7ea2\u3001\u9ed1\u56db\u7c7b\u6807\u51c6\u4e09\u5206\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u533b\u7597AI\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4f24\u4ea1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u53d1\u751f\u9891\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6536\u96c6\u8db3\u591f\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e09\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86AI\u5728\u7d27\u6025\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u6784\u5efaSyn-STARTS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u6807\u51c6\u4e09\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5START\u7684\u4e09\u5206\u7c7b\u533b\u7597\u573a\u666f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "Syn-STARTS\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u4e09\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u6025\u6551\u51b3\u7b56AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, existing OOC misinformation detection methods tend to emphasize the role of internal consistency, ignoring the significant of external consistency between image-text pairs and external evidence. In this paper, we propose HiEAG, a novel Hierarchical Evidence-Augmented Generation framework to refine external consistency checking through leveraging the extensive knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our approach decomposes external consistency checking into a comprehensive engine pipeline, which integrates reranking and rewriting, apart from retrieval. Evidence reranking module utilizes Automatic Evidence Selection Prompting (AESP) that acquires the relevant evidence item from the products of evidence retrieval. Subsequently, evidence rewriting module leverages Automatic Evidence Generation Prompting (AEGP) to improve task adaptation on MLLM-based OOC misinformation detectors. Furthermore, our approach enables explanation for judgment, and achieves impressive performance with instruction tuning. Experimental results on different benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed HiEAG surpasses previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the accuracy over all samples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHiEAG\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u8bc1\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u8bc1\u636e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u5916\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5305\u542b\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u91cd\u6392\u548c\u91cd\u5199\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bc1\u636e\u91cd\u6392\u6a21\u5757\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc1\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u793a\uff08AESP\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u68c0\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u4e2d\u7b5b\u9009\u76f8\u5173\u8bc1\u636e\uff1b\u8bc1\u636e\u91cd\u5199\u6a21\u5757\u5219\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc1\u636e\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u793a\uff08AEGP\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u5347MLLM\u5728OOC\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u5224\u65ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHiEAG\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709OOC\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5173\u6ce8\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u8bc1\u636e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u8bc1\u636e\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHiEAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8bc1\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc1\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u793a\uff08AESP\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u6392\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc1\u636e\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u793a\uff08AEGP\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u5199\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u5916\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cHiEAG\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HiEAG\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u8bc1\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5916\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684OOC misinformation\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Longbing Cao", "Mitchell McEwan", "Deborah Richards"], "title": "Passive Dementia Screening via Facial Temporal Micro-Dynamics Analysis of In-the-Wild Talking-Head Video", "comment": null, "summary": "We target passive dementia screening from short camera-facing talking head video, developing a facial temporal micro dynamics analysis for language free detection of early neuro cognitive change. This enables unscripted, in the wild video analysis at scale to capture natural facial behaviors, transferrable across devices, topics, and cultures without active intervention by clinicians or researchers during recording. Most existing resources prioritize speech or scripted interviews, limiting use outside clinics and coupling predictions to language and transcription. In contrast, we identify and analyze whether temporal facial kinematics, including blink dynamics, small mouth jaw motions, gaze variability, and subtle head adjustments, are sufficient for dementia screening without speech or text. By stabilizing facial signals, we convert these micro movements into interpretable facial microdynamic time series, smooth them, and summarize short windows into compact clip level statistics for screening. Each window is encoded by its activity mix (the relative share of motion across streams), thus the predictor analyzes the distribution of motion across streams rather than its magnitude, making per channel effects transparent. We also introduce YT DemTalk, a new dataset curated from publicly available, in the wild camera facing videos. It contains 300 clips (150 with self reported dementia, 150 controls) to test our model and offer a first benchmarking of the corpus. On YT DemTalk, ablations identify gaze lability and mouth/jaw dynamics as the most informative cues, and light weighted shallow classifiers could attain a dementia prediction performance of (AUROC) 0.953, 0.961 Average Precision (AP), 0.851 F1-score, and 0.857 accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u88ab\u52a8\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u7b5b\u67e5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u77ed\u65f6\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u62cd\u6444\u7684\u8bf4\u8bdd\u5934\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u5fae\u52a8\u6001\uff08\u5982\u7728\u773c\u3001\u5634\u90e8/\u4e0b\u988c\u5fae\u52a8\u3001\u89c6\u7ebf\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u5934\u90e8\u7ec6\u5fae\u8c03\u6574\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u5e72\u9884\u3001\u8de8\u8bbe\u5907\u3001\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u7136\u72b6\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6YT DemTalk\uff08300\u6bb5\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u542b150\u4f8b\u81ea\u62a5\u75f4\u5446\u4e0e150\u4f8b\u5bf9\u7167\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9762\u90e8\u5fae\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a33\u5b9a\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u5e73\u6ed1\u5904\u7406\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6\u7247\u6bb5\u7ea7\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u5e03\u800c\u975e\u5e45\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5224\u522b\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6ce8\u89c6\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u53e3\u988c\u8fd0\u52a8\u6700\u5177\u8bca\u65ad\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230AUROC 0.953\u3001AP 0.961\u3001F1-score 0.851\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u73870.857\u7684\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u75f4\u5446\u7b5b\u67e5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u97f3\u6216\u811a\u672c\u5316\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u8f6c\u5f55\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u65e0\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u72b6\u6001\u5206\u6790\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u9762\u90e8\u5fae\u52a8\u6001\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u795e\u7ecf\u8ba4\u77e5\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u88ab\u52a8\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u7684\u75f4\u5446\u7b5b\u67e5\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u90e8\u65f6\u95f4\u5fae\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u5bf9\u539f\u59cb\u89c6\u9891\u8fdb\u884c\u9762\u90e8\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5c06\u5fae\u52a8\u4f5c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u5bf9\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u63d0\u53d6\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u7247\u6bb5\u7ea7\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u2018\u6d3b\u52a8\u6df7\u5408\u2019\uff08activity mix\uff09\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5373\u5206\u6790\u5404\u8fd0\u52a8\u901a\u9053\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u8d21\u732e\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u5e03\u800c\u975e\u7edd\u5bf9\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6YT DemTalk\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6YT DemTalk\u4e0a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u7b5b\u67e5\u6027\u80fd\uff1a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8fbe\u5230AUROC 0.953\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08AP\uff090.961\uff0cF1-score 0.851\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u73870.857\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6ce8\u89c6\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u53e3\u988c\u5fae\u52a8\u662f\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5224\u522b\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ec5\u4f9d\u9760\u9762\u90e8\u5fae\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u8bed\u8a00\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u65e9\u671f\u7b5b\u67e5\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u65e0\u63a5\u89e6\u3001\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u3001\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8ba4\u77e5\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

During joint multimodal training, due to modality bias, the advantaged modality often dominates backpropagation, leading to imbalanced optimization. Existing methods still face two problems: First, the long-term dominance of the dominant modality weakens representation-output coupling in the late stages of training, resulting in the accumulation of redundant information. Second, previous methods often directly and uniformly adjust the gradients of the advantaged modality, ignoring the semantics and directionality between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Redundancy Regulation for Balanced Multimodal Information Refinement (RedReg), which is inspired by information bottleneck principle. Specifically, we construct a redundancy phase monitor that uses a joint criterion of effective gain growth rate and redundancy to trigger intervention only when redundancy is high. Furthermore, we design a co-information gating mechanism to estimate the contribution of the current dominant modality based on cross-modal semantics. When the task primarily relies on a single modality, the suppression term is automatically disabled to preserve modality-specific information. Finally, we project the gradient of the dominant modality onto the orthogonal complement of the joint multimodal gradient subspace and suppress the gradient according to redundancy. Experiments show that our method demonstrates superiority among current major methods in most scenarios. Ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of our method.

However, existing datasets like GoEmotions often suffer from severe class imbalance, which hampers model performance, especially for underrepresented emotions. To address this, we constructed a balanced multi-label sentiment dataset by integrating the original GoEmotions data, emotion-labeled samples from Sentiment140 using a RoBERTa-base-GoEmotions model, and manually annotated texts generated by GPT-4 mini. Our data balancing strategy ensured an even distribution across 28 emotion categories. Based on this dataset, we developed an enhanced multi-label classification model that combines pre-trained FastText embeddings, convolutional layers for local feature extraction, bidirectional LSTM for contextual learning, and an attention mechanism to highlight sentiment-relevant words. A sigmoid-activated output layer enables multi-label prediction, and mixed precision training improves computational efficiency.

Gen-ViRe: A Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark", "comment": "10 pages", "summary": "While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables sophisticated symbolic reasoning in LLMs, it remains confined to discrete text and cannot simulate the continuous, physics-governed dynamics of the real world. Recent video generation models have emerged as potential world simulators through Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning -- materializing thought as frame-by-frame visual sequences, with each frame representing a physically-grounded reasoning step. Despite compelling demonstrations, a challenge persists: existing benchmarks, focusing on fidelity or alignment, do not assess CoF reasoning and thus cannot measure core cognitive abilities in multi-step planning, algorithmic logic, or abstract pattern extrapolation. This evaluation void prevents systematic understanding of model capabilities and principled guidance for improvement. We introduce Gen-ViRe (Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark), a framework grounded in cognitive science and real-world AI applications, which decomposes CoF reasoning into six cognitive dimensions -- from perceptual logic to abstract planning -- and 24 subtasks. Through multi-source data curation, minimal prompting protocols, and hybrid VLM-assisted evaluation with detailed criteria, Gen-ViRe delivers the first quantitative assessment of video models as reasoners. Our experiments on SOTA systems reveal substantial discrepancies between impressive visual quality and actual reasoning depth, establishing baselines and diagnostic tools to advance genuine world simulators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGen-ViRe\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u94fe\u5f0f\u5e27\uff08CoF\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4ece\u611f\u77e5\u903b\u8f91\u5230\u62bd\u8c61\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u516d\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c24\u4e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u89c9\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u591a\u6b65\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u62bd\u8c61\u6a21\u5f0f\u5916\u63a8\u7b49\u6838\u5fc3\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u771f\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1Gen-ViRe\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u3001\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u534f\u8bae\u53ca\u6df7\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5206\u89e3CoF\u63a8\u7406\u4e3a\u516d\u7ef4\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e24\u4e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u9876\u5c16\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u7ebf\u4e0e\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u771f\u6b63\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "Gen-ViRe\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

This study presents evidence supporting an instructor-governed feedback loop that converts concept-level assessment evidence into vetted micro-interventions. The adaptive learning algorithm contains three safeguards: adequacy as a hard guarantee of gap closure, attention as a budgeted constraint for time and redundancy, and diversity as protection against overfitting to a single resource. We formalize intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows informed by ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy enforced through diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency regimes, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid method transitions along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with one thousand two hundred four students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for essentially all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by approximately twelve percentage points relative to greedy and harmonized difficulty across slates, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy with lower computational cost in scarce settings. Slack variables localized missing content and supported targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across subgroups. The result is a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic-pedagogical loop and delivers equitable, load-aware personalization at classroom scale.", "AI": {"tldr":

In this work, we find that the safety alignment of RVLMs can be easily break through a novel attack method termed \\textbf{Stealth Fine-Tuning}. Our method elicits harmful reasoning traces through \\textbf{segment-level interference} and reuses the self-generated outputs as supervised fine-tuning data. Through a \\textbf{turn-based weighted} loss design, yielding a lightweight, distribution-consistent finetuning method. In our experiment, with only 499 samples and under 3 hours on a single A100 (QLoRA), Stealth Fine-Tuning outperforms IDEATOR by 38.52\\% ASR while preserving general reasoning ability, as the tuned model retains the original representation distribution. Experiments on AdvBench and several general benchmarks demonstrate that Stealth Fine-Tuning is a low-cost and highly effective way to bypass alignment defenses. \\textcolor{red}{\\textbf{Disclaimer: This paper contains content that may be disturbing or offensive.}}", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a'\u9690\u79d8\u5fae\u8c03'(Stealth Fine-Tuning)\u7684\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7a81\u7834\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08RVLMs\uff09\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6bb5\u7ea7\u5e72\u6270\u8bf1\u53d1\u6709\u5bb3\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f6e\u6b21\u52a0\u6743\u635f\u5931\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700499\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5355\u5f20A100\u663e\u53613\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185\u5373\u53ef\u4f7f\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff08ASR\uff09\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5IDEATOR\u9ad8\u51fa38.52%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5728AdvBench\u53ca\u591a\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5747\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7ed5\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u5fa1\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u6709\u5bb3\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u66b4\u9732\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u75d5\u8ff9\u6210\u4e3a\u65b0\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u5165\u53e3\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e00\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9690\u853d\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f53\u524d\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u9690\u79d8\u5fae\u8c03\u2019\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bb5\u7ea7\u5e72\u6270\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6709\u5bb3\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff1b\u5c06\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u8f93\u51fa\u7528\u4f5c\u5fae\u8c03\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u8f6e\u6b21\u52a0\u6743\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u4e14\u5206\u5e03\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528499\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u3001\u5355\u5f20A100\u663e\u53613\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff08ASR\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4IDEATOR\u63d0\u534738.52%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5728AdvBench\u53ca\u591a\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4f4e\u4ee3\u4ef7\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7ed5\u8fc7\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9690\u853d\u4e14\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u9690\u79d8\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7ed5\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u900f\u660e\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

Our losses considerably increase the correlation between confidence scores and localization qualities, which is desirable because higher correlation leads to more accurate instance selection during Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and better Average Precision (mAP) performance. We refer to the models trained with our losses as RSPose.\n  We show the effectiveness of RSPose across two different modes: one-dimensional and two-dimensional heatmaps, on three different datasets (COCO, CrowdPose, MPII).\n  To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose losses that align with the evaluation metric (mAP) for human pose estimation.\n  RSPose outperforms the previous state of the art on the COCO-val set and achieves an mAP score of 79.9 with ViTPose-H, a vision transformer model for human pose estimation.\n  We also improve SimCC Resnet-50, a coordinate classification-based pose estimation method, by 1.5 AP on the COCO-val set, achieving 73.6 AP.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff08RSPose\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u70ed\u56fe\u6cd5\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff1a(P1) MSE\u635f\u5931\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u50cf\u7d20\u504f\u5dee\u540c\u7b49\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u4e0d\u5229\u4e8e\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u5cf0\u503c\u7684\u9510\u5316\u4e0e\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff1b(P2) \u70ed\u56fe\u5b58\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff1b(P3) \u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08mAP\uff09\u4e0e\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u635f\u5931\uff08\u5982MSE\u3001KL\u6563\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5f97\u5206\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584NMS\u4e2d\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0emAP\u8868\u73b0\u3002RSPose\u5728COCO\u3001CrowdPose\u3001MPII\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728COCO-val\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523079.9 mAP\uff08ViTPose-H\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7fSimCC ResNet-50\u63d0\u53471.5 AP\u81f373.6\uff0c\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9mAP\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u70ed\u56fe\u6cd5\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u56e0\u4f7f\u7528MSE\u7b49\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0d\u51c6\u3001\u70ed\u56fe\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u53ca\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff08mAP\uff09\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u70ed\u56fe\u4e2d\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u5cf0\u503c\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6392\u5e8f\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5cf0\u503c\u9510\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0emAP\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e00\u7ef4\u4e0e\u4e8c\u7ef4\u70ed\u56fe\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "RSPose\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u5148\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5728COCO-val\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523079.9 mAP\uff08ViTPose-H\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06SimCC ResNet-50\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53471.5 AP\u81f373.6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0emAP\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u70ed\u56fe\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u57fa\u4e8e\u70ed\u56fe\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Despite recent advances in deep learning models for medical time-series forecasting, several challenges persist, including the lack of standardized benchmarks, incomplete data, and limited cross-center validation. To address these challenges, we introduce VitalBench, a novel benchmark specifically designed for intraoperative vital sign prediction. VitalBench includes data from over 4,000 surgeries across two independent medical centers, offering three evaluation tracks: complete data, incomplete data, and cross-center generalization. This framework reflects the real-world complexities of clinical practice, minimizing reliance on extensive preprocessing and incorporating masked loss techniques for robust and unbiased model evaluation. By providing a standardized and unified platform for model development and comparison, VitalBench enables researchers to focus on architectural innovation while ensuring consistency in data handling. This work lays the foundation for advancing predictive models for intraoperative vital sign forecasting, ensuring that these models are not only accurate but also robust and adaptable across diverse clinical environments.

Thousands of rare and zero-shot ICD codes are severely underrepresented in datasets like MIMIC-III, leading to low macro-F1 scores. In this work, we propose a data-centric framework that generates high-quality synthetic discharge summaries to mitigate this imbalance. Our method constructs realistic multi-label code sets anchored on rare codes by leveraging real-world co-occurrence patterns, ICD descriptions, synonyms, taxonomy, and similar clinical notes. Using these structured prompts, we generate 90,000 synthetic notes covering 7,902 ICD codes, significantly expanding the training distribution. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art transformer-based models, PLM-ICD and GKI-ICD, on both the original and extended datasets.

Webpage: https://krantiparida.github.io/projects/cs3.html", "summary": "Humans excel at multisensory perception and can often recognise object properties from the sound of their interactions. Inspired by this, we propose the novel task of Collision Sound Source Segmentation (CS3), where we aim to segment the objects responsible for a collision sound in visual input (i.e. video frames from the collision clip), conditioned on the audio. This task presents unique challenges. Unlike isolated sound events, a collision sound arises from interactions between two objects, and the acoustic signature of the collision depends on both. We focus on egocentric video, where sounds are often clear, but the visual scene is cluttered, objects are small, and interactions are brief.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a weakly-supervised method for audio-conditioned segmentation, utilising foundation models (CLIP and SAM2). We also incorporate egocentric cues, i.e. objects in hands, to find acting objects that can potentially be collision sound sources. Our approach outperforms competitive baselines by $3\\times$ and $4.7\\times$ in mIoU on two benchmarks we introduce for the CS3 task: EPIC-CS3 and Ego4D-CS3.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u78b0\u649e\u58f0\u97f3\u6e90\u5206\u5272\uff08CS3\uff09\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6839\u636e\u97f3\u9891\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5206\u5272\u51fa\u5f15\u53d1\u78b0\u649e\u58f0\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u3002\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578bCLIP\u548cSAM2\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u89d2\u4e2d\u7684\u624b\u90e8\u52a8\u4f5c\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u97f3\u9891\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe3\u500d\u548c4.7\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u4f53\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u58f0\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u5176\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7531\u4e24\u4e2a\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u590d\u6742\u78b0\u649e\u58f0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u6742\u4e71\u3001\u7269\u4f53\u5c0f\u4e14\u4ea4\u4e92\u77ed\u6682\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CLIP\u548cSAM2\u7b49\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u97f3\u9891\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u89d2\u4e2d\u7684\u624b\u90e8\u7269\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u4f5c\u7ebf\u7d22\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u58f0\u97f3\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u5efa\u7684EPIC-CS3\u548cEgo4D-CS3\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cmIoU\u6307\u6807\u5206\u522b\u6bd4\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u7ebf\u9ad8\u51fa3\u500d\u548c4.7\u500d\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684CS3\u4efb\u52a1\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u89c6\u89d2\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u78b0\u649e\u58f0\u97f3\u6e90\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

However, these models often produce chemically invalid molecules, which limits the usable scope of the learned chemical space and poses significant challenges for practical applications. To address this issue, we propose ChemFixer, a framework designed to correct invalid molecules into valid ones. ChemFixer is built on a transformer architecture, pre-trained using masking techniques, and fine-tuned on a large-scale dataset of valid/invalid molecular pairs that we constructed. Through comprehensive evaluations across diverse generative models, ChemFixer improved molecular validity while effectively preserving the chemical and biological distributional properties of the original outputs. This indicates that ChemFixer can recover molecules that could not be previously generated, thereby expanding the diversity of potential drug candidates. Furthermore, ChemFixer was effectively applied to a drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction task using limited data, improving the validity of generated ligands and discovering promising ligand-protein pairs. These results suggest that ChemFixer is not only effective in data-limited scenarios, but also extensible to a wide range of downstream tasks. Taken together, ChemFixer shows promise as a practical tool for various stages of deep learning-based drug discovery, enhancing molecular validity and expanding accessible chemical space.", "AI": {"tldr": "ChemFixer \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e Transformer \u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u4fee\u590d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6709\u6548/\u65e0\u6548\u5206\u5b50\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u65e0\u6548\u5206\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u5206\u5b50\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u6709\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u751f\u7269\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u5b50\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u53ef\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u836f\u7269-\u9776\u70b9\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u5316\u5b66\u65e0\u6548\u5206\u5b50\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u6269\u5927\u53ef\u7528\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e Transformer \u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u81ea\u5efa\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6709\u6548/\u65e0\u6548\u5206\u5b50\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u65e0\u6548\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u4fee\u590d\u3002", "result": "ChemFixer \u5728\u591a\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u5b50\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u539f\u59cb\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u4e0e\u751f\u7269\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u5728\u836f\u7269-\u9776\u70b9\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u914d\u4f53\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u914d\u4f53-\u86cb\u767d\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u3002", "conclusion": "ChemFixer \u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, crafting satisfactory designs is time-intensive for designers: they need to consider which controls and content to present on the page, and then repeatedly adjust their size, position, and style for better aesthetics and structure. Although many design software can now help to perform these repetitive tasks, extensive training is needed to use them effectively. Moreover, collaborative design across app pages demands extra time to align standards and ensure consistent styling. In this work, we propose APD-agents, a large language model (LLM) driven multi-agent framework for automated page design in mobile applications. Our framework contains OrchestratorAgent, SemanticParserAgent, PrimaryLayoutAgent, TemplateRetrievalAgent, and RecursiveComponentAgent. Upon receiving the user's description of the page, the OrchestratorAgent can dynamically can direct other agents to accomplish users' design task. To be specific, the SemanticParserAgent is responsible for converting users' descriptions of page content into structured data. The PrimaryLayoutAgent can generate an initial coarse-grained layout of this page. The TemplateRetrievalAgent can fetch semantically relevant few-shot examples and enhance the quality of layout generation. Besides, a RecursiveComponentAgent can be used to decide how to recursively generate all the fine-grained sub-elements it contains for each element in the layout. Our work fully leverages the automatic collaboration capabilities of large-model-driven multi-agent systems.

However, APR models typically operate as black boxes, directly regressing a 6-DoF pose from a query image, which can lead to memorizing training views rather than understanding 3D scene geometry. In this work, we propose a geometrically-grounded alternative. Inspired by novel view synthesis, which renders images from intermediate geometric representations, we reformulate APR as its inverse that regresses the underlying 3D representations directly from the image, and we name this paradigm Geometric Representation Regression (GRR). Our model explicitly predicts two disentangled geometric representations in the world coordinate system: (1) a ray bundle's directions to estimate camera rotation, and (2) a corresponding pointmap to estimate camera translation. The final 6-DoF camera pose is then recovered from these geometric components using a differentiable deterministic solver. This disentangled approach, which separates the learned visual-to-geometry mapping from the final pose calculation, introduces a strong geometric prior into the network. We find that the explicit decoupling of rotation and translation predictions measurably boosts performance. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on 7-Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets, validating that modeling the inverse rendering process is a more robust path toward generalizable absolute pose estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u56de\u5f52\uff08GRR\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7edd\u5bf9\u59ff\u6001\u56de\u5f52\uff08APR\uff09\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u9884\u6d4b6-DoF\u59ff\u6001\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cGRR\u53cd\u5411\u601d\u8003\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u5f52\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u5e94\u76843D\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u59ff\u6001\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u4e24\u4e2a\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\uff1a\u5c04\u7ebf\u675f\u65b9\u5411\uff08\u7528\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u65cb\u8f6c\uff09\u548c\u5bf9\u5e94\u70b9\u56fe\uff08\u7528\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e73\u79fb\uff09\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6062\u590d\u5b8c\u6574\u59ff\u6001\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u89e3\u8026\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5f3a\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u57287-Scenes\u548cCambridge Landmarks\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7edd\u5bf9\u59ff\u6001\u56de\u5f52\uff08APR\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ed1\u7bb1\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u56fe\u800c\u975e\u7406\u89e33D\u573a\u666f\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u3002\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u56de\u5f52\uff08GRR\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06APR\u9006\u5411\u4e3a\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u56de\u5f52\u5e95\u5c423D\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u663e\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\u5c04\u7ebf\u65b9\u5411\uff08\u7528\u4e8e\u65cb\u8f6c\uff09\u548c\u70b9\u56fe\uff08\u7528\u4e8e\u5e73\u79fb\uff09\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5408\u6210\u6700\u7ec86-DoF\u59ff\u6001\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u89e3\u8026\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u79bb\u89c6\u89c9\u5230\u51e0\u4f55\u6620\u5c04\u4e0e\u59ff\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u57287-Scenes\u548cCambridge Landmarks\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9006\u5411\u6e32\u67d3\u5efa\u6a21\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u89e3\u8026\u8bbe\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u65b0\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u5f523D\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u800c\u975e\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u59ff\u6001\uff0cGRR\u8303\u5f0f\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

To address this low-resource challenge, we propose a self-training framework that leverages abundant unlabeled data through collaborative pseudo-labeling. Starting with a lightweight classifier trained on limited labeled data, our method iteratively assigns pseudo-labels to unlabeled instances with the support of Multi-Agent Vision-Language Models (MA-VLMs). Un-labeled data on which the classifier and MA-VLMs agree are designated as the Agreed-Unknown set, while conflicting samples form the Disagreed-Unknown set. To enhance label reliability, MA-VLMs simulate dual perspectives, moderator and user, capturing both regulatory and subjective viewpoints. The classifier is optimized using a novel Positive-Negative-Unlabeled (PNU) loss, which jointly exploits labeled, Agreed-Unknown, and Disagreed-Unknown data while mitigating pseudo-label noise.

KGs are structured representations of factual knowledge consisting of entities and relations. Due to the high construction cost, they had been regarded as static databases with validated links. However, the recent development of Transformer-based relation extraction (RE) methods has enabled us to generate KGs dynamically by giving them natural language texts, and thereby opened the possibility for representing the meaning of the input sentences with the created KGs. Using this effect, we propose a method that answers MCQs in the \"fill-in-the-blank\" format, taking care of the point that RE methods generate KGs that represent false information if provided with factually incorrect texts.

Multi-sequence contrast-enhanced MRI is commonly used for recurrence detection; however, interpreting these scans remains challenging, even for experienced radiologists, due to post-surgical alterations such as scarring, swelling, and tissue remodeling. AI-assisted diagnostic tools have shown promise in improving bladder cancer recurrence prediction, yet progress in this field is hindered by the lack of dedicated multi-sequence MRI datasets for recurrence assessment study. In this work, we first introduce a curated multi-sequence, multi-modal MRI dataset specifically designed for bladder cancer recurrence prediction, establishing a valuable benchmark for future research. We then propose H-CNN-ViT, a new Hierarchical Gated Attention Multi-Branch model that enables selective weighting of features from the global (ViT) and local (CNN) paths based on contextual demands, achieving a balanced and targeted feature fusion. Our multi-branch architecture processes each modality independently, ensuring that the unique properties of each imaging channel are optimally captured and integrated.

However, real-world deployments often involve mixed distribution shifts, where test samples are affected by diverse and potentially conflicting domain factors, posing significant challenges even for SOTA TTA methods. A key limitation in existing approaches is their reliance on a unified adaptation path, which fails to account for the fact that optimal gradient directions can vary significantly across different domains. Moreover, current benchmarks focus only on synthetic or homogeneous shifts, failing to capture the complexity of real-world heterogeneous mixed distribution shifts. To address this, we propose MoETTA, a novel entropy-based TTA framework that integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Rather than enforcing a single parameter update rule for all test samples, MoETTA introduces a set of structurally decoupled experts, enabling adaptation along diverse gradient directions. This design allows the model to better accommodate heterogeneous shifts through flexible and disentangled parameter updates. To simulate realistic deployment conditions, we introduce two new benchmarks: potpourri and potpourri+. While classical settings focus solely on synthetic corruptions, potpourri encompasses a broader range of domain shifts--including natural, artistic, and adversarial distortions--capturing more realistic deployment challenges. Additionally, potpourri+ further includes source-domain samples to evaluate robustness against catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments across three mixed distribution shifts settings show that MoETTA consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing SOTA performance and highlighting the benefit of modeling multiple adaptation directions via expert-level diversity.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoETTA\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08MoE\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2a\u89e3\u8026\u4e13\u5bb6\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u5316\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5411\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6potpourri\u548cpotpourri+\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u81ea\u7136\u3001\u827a\u672f\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u7b49\u591a\u6837\u626d\u66f2\uff0c\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eMoETTA\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709TTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7edf\u4e00\u9002\u5e94\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u591a\u4e3a\u5408\u6210\u6216\u540c\u8d28\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u53cd\u6620\u5b9e\u9645\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMoETTA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08MoE\uff09\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6837\u672c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u540c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u65b9\u5411\u7075\u6d3b\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u71b5\u673a\u5236\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e13\u5bb6\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cMoETTA\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e3b\u6d41\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e13\u5bb6\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MoETTA\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u71b5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Recent research underscores the potential of harnessing large language models (LLMs) for VLN, given their commonsense knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. Despite their strengths, a substantial gap in task completion performance persists between LLM-based approaches and domain experts, as LLMs inherently struggle to comprehend real-world spatial correlations precisely. Additionally, introducing LLMs is accompanied with substantial computational cost and inference latency. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-process thinking framework dubbed R3, integrating LLMs' generalization capabilities with VLN-specific expertise in a zero-shot manner. The framework comprises three core modules: Runner, Ruminator, and Regulator. The Runner is a lightweight transformer-based expert model that ensures efficient and accurate navigation under regular circumstances. The Ruminator employs a powerful multimodal LLM as the backbone and adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to elicit structured reasoning.

To alleviate the issue of lacking high-quality data for model alignment, some works on weak-to-strong generalization (W2SG) finetune a strong pretrained model with a weak supervisor so that it can generalize beyond weak supervision. However, the invariable use of weak supervision in existing methods exposes issues in robustness, with a proportion of weak labels proving harmful to models. In this paper, we propose a selective W2SG framework to avoid using weak supervision when unnecessary. We train a binary classifier P(IK) to identify questions that a strong model can answer and use its self-generated labels for alignment. We further refine weak labels with a graph smoothing method. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms competitive baselines.

Recent adaptations using domain-specific encoders, such as PubMedBERT or ClinicalBERT, mitigate this issue by leveraging medical corpora, but remain constrained by their limited input length (typically 512 tokens) and relatively shallow semantic understanding. To address these limitations, we propose QwenCLIP, a vision-language framework that replaces CLIP's text encoder with a large language model (LLM)-based embedding module (e.g., Qwen3-Embedding) and introduces learnable prompts to enhance cross-modal alignment. By leveraging the extended context window and richer representations of LLMs, QwenCLIP captures comprehensive medical semantics from long-form clinical text, substantially improving medical image-text alignment and downstream performance on radiology benchmarks.

In contrast, tokens, which play essential roles in many research fields, exhibit similar characteristics of growth, yet investigations into their incremental learning remain significantly scarce. This research gap primarily stems from the holistic nature of tokens in language, which imposes significant challenges on the design of incremental learning frameworks for them. To overcome this obstacle, in this work, we turn to a type of token, gene, for a large-scale biological dataset--single-cell transcriptomics--to formulate a pipeline for gene incremental learning and establish corresponding evaluations. We found that the forgetting problem also exists in gene incremental learning, thus we adapted existing class incremental learning methods to mitigate the forgetting of genes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrated the soundness of our framework design and evaluations, as well as the effectiveness of our method adaptations.

Yet, we lack a clear understanding of where these symbolic hallucinations originate, making it crucial to systematically handle such triggers and localize the emergence of hallucination inside the model. While prior work explored localization using statistical techniques like LSC and activation variance analysis, these methods treat all tokens equally and overlook the role symbolic linguistic knowledge plays in triggering hallucinations. So far, no approach has investigated how symbolic elements specifically drive hallucination failures across model layers, nor has symbolic linguistic knowledge been used as the foundation for a localization framework. We propose the first symbolic localization framework that leverages symbolic linguistic and semantic knowledge to meaningfully trace the development of hallucinations across all model layers. By focusing on how models process symbolic triggers, we analyze five models using HaluEval and TruthfulQA. Our symbolic knowledge approach reveals that attention variance for these linguistic elements explodes to critical instability in early layers (2-4), with negation triggering catastrophic variance levels, demonstrating that symbolic semantic processing breaks down from the very beginning. Through the lens of symbolic linguistic knowledge, despite larger model sizes, hallucination rates remain consistently high (78.3%-83.7% across Gemma variants), with steep attention drops for symbolic semantic triggers throughout deeper layers. Our findings demonstrate that hallucination is fundamentally a symbolic linguistic processing failure, not a general generation problem, revealing that symbolic semantic knowledge provides the key to understanding and localizing hallucination mechanisms in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7b26\u53f7\u5e7b\u89c9\u5728\u5404\u5c42\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e94\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5728HaluEval\u548cTruthfulQA\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b26\u53f7\u89e6\u53d1\u8bcd\uff08\u5982\u5426\u5b9a\u3001\u6570\u5b57\u3001\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\uff09\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\uff082-4\u5c42\uff09\u5373\u5f15\u53d1\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u5267\u70c8\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5426\u5b9a\u8bcd\u5bfc\u81f4\u707e\u96be\u6027\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u4ecd\u7ef4\u6301\u572878.3%-83.7%\u7684\u9ad8\u4f4d\uff0c\u4e14\u6df1\u5c42\u5bf9\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u4e49\u89e6\u53d1\u8bcd\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u5e7b\u89c9\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6cdb\u5316\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e7b\u89c9\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u7b26\u53f7\u89e6\u53d1\u8bcd\uff08\u5982\u5426\u5b9a\u3001\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u4f8b\u5916\u3001\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\uff09\u65f6\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b26\u53f7\u5e7b\u89c9\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u7f3a\u5c11\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982LSC\u3001\u6fc0\u6d3b\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u6790\uff09\u5ffd\u7565\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u8a00\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u7b26\u53f7\u89e6\u53d1\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee5\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u5e7b\u89c9\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u7b26\u53f7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7b26\u53f7\u89e6\u53d1\u8bcd\u7684\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5e7b\u89c9\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u91c7\u7528HaluEval\u548cTruthfulQA\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e94\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u7b26\u53f7\u89e6\u53d1\u8bcd\u5728\u5404\u5c42\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7b26\u53f7\u89e6\u53d1\u8bcd\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\uff082-4\u5c42\uff09\u5373\u5f15\u53d1\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u5dee\u6025\u5267\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5426\u5b9a\u8bcd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6700\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u4ecd\u9ad8\u8fbe78.3%-83.7%\uff0c\u4e14\u6df1\u5c42\u5bf9\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u4e49\u89e6\u53d1\u8bcd\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6301\u7eed\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u5e7b\u89c9\u5e76\u975e\u4e00\u822c\u751f\u6210\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u4e49\u5904\u7406\u4ece\u521d\u59cb\u9636\u6bb5\u5c31\u5f00\u59cb\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e7b\u89c9\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e7b\u89c9\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u56f4\u7ed5\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u8a00\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

The proposed model is differentiated from traditional transfer learning methods as it incorporates a Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer along with a Sparsity-Induced Feature Reduction Layer that forms a multi-tiered framework, further improving feature selection and representation. The Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer makes smart variations of feature weights, with more detailed anatomical features, which are mostly left out in a transfer learning setup. In addition, the Sparsity-Induced Layer removes redundancy for learned features, producing lean yet robust representations for pathology in the lumbar spine. This architecture is novel as it overcomes the constraints in the traditional transfer learning approach, especially in the high-dimensional context of medical images, and achieves a significant performance boost, reaching a precision of 0.9, recall of 0.861, F1 score of 0.88, loss of 0.18, and an accuracy of 88.1%, compared to the baseline model, EfficientNet.

Achieving near-peak performance still demands deep hardware expertise-experts either handcraft target-specific kernels (e.g., DeepSeek) or rely on specialized libraries (e.g., CUTLASS)-both of which add complexity and limit scalability for most ML practitioners.\n  This paper introduces a compilation scheme that automatically generates scalable, high-performance microkernels by leveraging the MLIR dialects to bridge domain-level operations and processor capabilities. Our approach removes dependence on low-level libraries by enabling the compiler to auto-generate near-optimal code directly. At its core is a mechanism for composing nanokernels from low-level IR constructs with near-optimal register utilization, forming efficient microkernels tailored to each target. We implement this technique in an MLIR-based compiler supporting both vector and tile based CPU instructions.

However, these approaches often depend on handcrafted prompts and suffer from inconsistent performance, limiting their robustness and generalization in real-world scenarios. In this work, we evaluate state-of-the-art open-source VLMs on high-level decision-making tasks using ego-view visual inputs and identify critical limitations in their ability to deliver reliable, context-aware decisions. Motivated by these observations, we propose a new approach that shifts the role of VLMs from direct decision generators to semantic enhancers. Specifically, we leverage their strong general scene understanding to enrich existing vision-based benchmarks with structured, linguistically rich scene descriptions. Building on this enriched representation, we introduce a multi-modal interactive architecture that fuses visual and linguistic features for more accurate decision-making and interpretable textual explanations. Furthermore, we design a post-hoc refinement module that utilizes VLMs to enhance prediction reliability.

Recent approaches attempt to estimate rewards for unlabeled datasets using a small set of expert demonstrations. However, these methods often assume that the similarity between a trajectory and an expert demonstration is positively correlated with the reward, which oversimplifies the underlying reward structure. We propose PROF, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate and improve executable reward function codes from natural language descriptions and a single expert trajectory. We propose Reward Preference Ranking (RPR), a novel reward function quality assessment and ranking strategy without requiring environment interactions or RL training. RPR calculates the dominance scores of the reward functions, where higher scores indicate better alignment with expert preferences. By alternating between RPR and text-based gradient optimization, PROF fully automates the selection and refinement of optimal reward functions for downstream policy learning. Empirical results on D4RL demonstrate that PROF surpasses or matches recent strong baselines across numerous datasets and domains, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "PROF\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u5355\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u6216\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u6392\u5e8f\u7b56\u7565RPR\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f7f\u7528RPR\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u7cbe\u70bc\uff0c\u5728D4RL\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u9886\u57df\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u5ab2\u7f8e\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u7ebf\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u793a\u8303\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8fd9\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002\u4e3a\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e00\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "method": "PROF\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u521d\u59cb\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u5f15\u5165Reward Preference Ranking\uff08RPR\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u504f\u597d\u8ba1\u7b97\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u652f\u914d\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u4ee5\u65e0\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u7b5b\u9009\u6700\u4f18\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7528\u4e8e\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728D4RL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPROF\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u57df\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u6216\u5339\u914d\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PROF\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u504f\u597d\u6392\u5e8f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebf\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u65e0\u663e\u5f0f\u5956\u52b1\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5de5\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We test this fundamental question with a series of chronological ordering tasks with increasing complexities over facts the model already knows from pre-training. Our tasks cover (1) chronological ordering, (2) conditional sorting (filter, then order), and (3) anachronism detection. We evaluate GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, with and without Extended Thinking (ET), and GPT-5 across multiple reasoning-effort settings. Across models, Exact match rate drops sharply as sequences lengthen even while rank correlations stay high as LLMs largely preserve local order but struggle to maintain a single globally consistent timeline. In conditional sorting, most failures stem from the filtering step rather than the ordering step, but GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking outshine normal models significantly. Lastly, anachronism detection is found to be the easiest task for the LLMs but performance still declines with increasingly overlapping timelines or entities. Overall, our main contribution is showing that allocating explicit reasoning budget helps with chronological ordering with GPT-5 at medium/high reasoning effort achieving flawless ordering at all lengths and perfect conditional sorting (both self-filtered and given-subset), whereas low/minimal effort degrades with longer lists, mirroring earlier models.

Arabic has a complicated morphological and syntactic structure, posing a greater challenge than other languages. Even though modern neural models have improved greatly in recent years, the majority of previous attempts used individual models without taking into account the potential benefits of combining different systems. In this paper, we present one of the first multi-system approaches for correcting grammatical errors in Arabic, the Arab Enhanced Edit Selection System Complication (ArbESC+). Several models are used to collect correction proposals, which are represented as numerical features in the framework. A classifier determines and implements the appropriate corrections based on these features. In order to improve output quality, the framework uses support techniques to filter overlapping corrections and estimate decision reliability. A combination of AraT5, ByT5, mT5, AraBART, AraBART+Morph+GEC, and Text editing systems gave better results than a single model alone, with F0.5 at 82.63% on QALB-14 test data, 84.64% on QALB-15 L1 data, and 65.55% on QALB-15 L2 data. As one of the most significant contributions of this work, it's the first Arab attempt to integrate linguistic error correction. Improving existing models provides a practical step towards developing advanced tools that will benefit users and researchers of Arabic text processing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aArbESC+\u7684\u591a\u7cfb\u7edf\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u8bed\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408AraT5\u3001ByT5\u3001mT5\u3001AraBART\u3001AraBART+Morph+GEC\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u8f91\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6570\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u7ea0\u9519\u6548\u679c\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728QALB-14\u3001QALB-15 L1\u548cL2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u53d6\u5f9782.63%\u300184.64%\u548c65.55%\u7684F0.5\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u8bed\u6cd5\u7ea0\u9519\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u5177\u6709\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bed\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7ea0\u9519\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faArbESC+\u591a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7ea0\u9519\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5c06\u5efa\u8bae\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6570\u503c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u4fee\u6b63\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u652f\u6301\u6280\u672f\u8fc7\u6ee4\u91cd\u590d\u4fee\u6b63\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u51b3\u7b56\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728QALB-14\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523082.63% F0.5\uff0c\u5728QALB-15 L1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe84.64%\uff0c\u5728QALB-15 L2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe65.55%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "ArbESC+\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u8bed\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u7684\u591a\u7cfb\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ea0\u9519\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u6587\u672c\u5904\u7406\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In this study, we focus on the scaling relationship with data size in the context of medical anatomical segmentation, a domain that remains underexplored. We analyze scaling laws for anatomical segmentation across 15 semantic tasks and 4 imaging modalities, demonstrating that larger datasets significantly improve segmentation performance, following similar scaling trends. Motivated by the topological isomorphism in images sharing anatomical structures, we evaluate the impact of deformation-guided augmentation strategies on data scaling laws, specifically random elastic deformation and registration-guided deformation. We also propose a novel, scalable image augmentation approach that generates diffeomorphic mappings from geodesic subspace based on image registration to introduce realistic deformation. Our experimental results demonstrate that both registered and generated deformation-based augmentation considerably enhance data utilization efficiency. The proposed generated deformation method notably achieves superior performance and accelerated convergence, surpassing standard power law scaling trends without requiring additional data.

Instead of a single softmax probability distribution, CREDIT predicts class-wise probability intervals that define a credal set, a convex set of probability distributions, for uncertainty quantification.

However, it frequently suffers from hallucination errors, especially under noisy acoustic conditions. Previous works to reduce hallucinations in Whisper-style ASR systems have primarily focused on audio preprocessing or post-processing of transcriptions to filter out erroneous content. However, modifications to the Whisper model itself remain largely unexplored to mitigate hallucinations directly. To address this challenge, we present a two-stage architecture that first enhances encoder robustness through Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) and further suppresses hallucinations using a multi-objective knowledge distillation (KD) framework. In the first stage, ALA groups encoder layers into semantically coherent blocks via inter-layer correlation analysis. A learnable multi-head attention module then fuses these block representations, enabling the model to jointly exploit low- and high-level features for more robust encoding. In the second stage, our KD framework trains the student model on noisy audio to align its semantic and attention distributions with a teacher model processing clean inputs. Our experiments on noisy speech benchmarks show notable reductions in hallucinations and word error rates, while preserving performance on clean speech. Together, ALA and KD offer a principled strategy to improve Whisper's reliability under real-world noisy conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u67b6\u6784\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347Whisper\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5608\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08ALA\uff09\u589e\u5f3a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u5c06\u7f16\u7801\u5c42\u5206\u7ec4\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u9ad8\u5c42\u4e0e\u4f4e\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff08KD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u97f3\u9891\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e72\u51c0\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5728\u5e72\u51c0\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "Whisper\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u5e7b\u89c9\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u97f3\u9891\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6216\u8f6c\u5f55\u540e\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u5bf9Whisper\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u7f13\u89e3\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u67b6\u6784\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08ALA\uff09\u5bf9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7ec4\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u591a\u5c42\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7f16\u7801\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e72\u51c0\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6291\u5236\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u566a\u58f0\u8bed\u97f3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u548c\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5728\u5e72\u51c0\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ALA\u4e0eKD\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347Whisper\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

We address this by constructing a large, music-related natural language corpus (40B tokens) that combines open source and in-house data, and by implementing a domain-first data pipeline: a lightweight classifier filters and weights in-domain text, followed by multi-stage cleaning, de-duplication, and privacy-preserving masking. We further integrate multi-source music text with associated metadata to form a broader, better-structured foundation of domain knowledge. On the training side, we introduce reference-model (RM)-based token-level soft scoring for quality control: a unified loss-ratio criterion is used both for data selection and for dynamic down-weighting during optimization, reducing noise gradients and amplifying task-aligned signals, thereby enabling more effective music-domain continued pretraining and alignment. To assess factuality, we design the MusicSimpleQA benchmark, which adopts short, single-answer prompts with automated agreement scoring. Beyond the benchmark design, we conduct systematic comparisons along the axes of data composition.

Whether single-task, vision-language, WSI-optimized, or single-cell hematology models, these approaches share a key limitation, they cannot provide unified, multi-task, multi-modal reasoning across the complexities of digital hematopathology. To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-Hema, a multi-task, unified model for digital hematopathology integrating detection, classification, segmentation, morphology prediction, and reasoning across multiple diseases. Uni-Hema leverages 46 publicly available datasets, encompassing over 700K images and 21K question-answer pairs, and is built upon Hema-Former, a multimodal module that bridges visual and textual representations at the hierarchy level for the different tasks (detection, classification, segmentation, morphology, mask language modeling and visual question answer) at different granularity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni-Hema achieves comparable or superior performance to train on a single-task and single dataset models, across diverse hematological tasks, while providing interpretable, morphologically relevant insights at the single-cell level. Our framework establishes a new standard for multi-task and multi-modal digital hematopathology.

Traditional methods use a fixed temperature throughout training, which is suboptimal. Moreover, architectural differences between teacher and student often result in mismatched logit magnitudes. We demonstrate that students benefit from softer probabilities early in training but require sharper probabilities in later stages. We introduce Dynamic Temperature Scheduler (DTS), which adjusts temperature dynamically based on the cross-entropy loss gap between teacher and student. To our knowledge, this is the first temperature scheduling method that adapts based on the divergence between teacher and student distributions.

To address these issues, we propose DevPiolt, a LLM-based recommendation model for IoT device operations. Specifically, we first equip the LLM with fundamental domain knowledge of IoT operations via continual pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning. Then, we employ direct preference optimization to align the fine-tuned LLM with specific user preferences. Finally, we design a confidence-based exposure control mechanism to avoid negative user experiences from low-quality recommendations. Extensive experiments show that DevPiolt significantly outperforms baselines on all datasets, with an average improvement of 69.5% across all metrics.

Existing approaches simulate a simplified workflow where actors dub directly without preparation, overlooking the critical director-actor interaction. In contrast, authentic workflows involve a dynamic collaboration: directors actively engage with actors, guiding them to internalize the context cues, specifically emotion, before performance. To address this issue, we propose a new Retrieve-Augmented Director-Actor Interaction Learning scheme to achieve authentic movie dubbing, termed Authentic-Dubber, which contains three novel mechanisms: (1) We construct a multimodal Reference Footage library to simulate the learning footage provided by directors. Note that we integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve deep comprehension of emotional representations across multimodal signals. (2) To emulate how actors efficiently and comprehensively internalize director-provided footage during dubbing, we propose an Emotion-Similarity-based Retrieval-Augmentation strategy. This strategy retrieves the most relevant multimodal information that aligns with the target silent video. (3) We develop a Progressive Graph-based speech generation approach that incrementally incorporates the retrieved multimodal emotional knowledge, thereby simulating the actor's final dubbing process. The above mechanisms enable the Authentic-Dubber to faithfully replicate the authentic dubbing workflow, achieving comprehensive improvements in emotional expressiveness. Both subjective and objective evaluations on the V2C Animation benchmark dataset validate the effectiveness.

DeSouza"], "title": "Weakly Supervised Ephemeral Gully Detection In Remote Sensing Images Using Vision Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Among soil erosion problems, Ephemeral Gullies are one of the most concerning phenomena occurring in agricultural fields. Their short temporal cycles increase the difficulty in automatically detecting them using classical computer vision approaches and remote sensing. Also, due to scarcity of and the difficulty in producing accurate labeled data, automatic detection of ephemeral gullies using Machine Learning is limited to zero-shot approaches which are hard to implement. To overcome these challenges, we present the first weakly supervised pipeline for detection of ephemeral gullies. Our method relies on remote sensing and uses Vision Language Models (VLMs) to drastically reduce the labor-intensive task of manual labeling. In order to achieve that, the method exploits: 1) the knowledge embedded in the VLM's pretraining; 2) a teacher-student model where the teacher learns from noisy labels coming from the VLMs, and the student learns by weak supervision using teacher-generate labels and a noise-aware loss function. We also make available the first-of-its-kind dataset for semi-supervised detection of ephemeral gully from remote-sensed images. The dataset consists of a number of locations labeled by a group of soil and plant scientists, as well as a large number of unlabeled locations.

Accurately forecasting regional Airbnb market trends can thus offer critical insights for policymakers and urban planners aiming to mitigate these impacts. This study proposes a novel time-series forecasting framework to predict three key Airbnb indicators -- Revenue, Reservation Days, and Number of Reservations -- at the regional level. Using a sliding-window approach, the model forecasts trends 1 to 3 months ahead. Unlike prior studies that focus on individual listings at fixed time points, our approach constructs regional representations by integrating listing features with external contextual factors such as urban accessibility and human mobility. We convert structured tabular data into prompt-based inputs for a Large Language Model (LLM), producing comprehensive regional embeddings. These embeddings are then fed into advanced time-series models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer) to better capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Experiments on Seoul's Airbnb dataset show that our method reduces both average RMSE and MAE by approximately 48% compared to conventional baselines, including traditional statistical and machine learning models. Our framework not only improves forecasting accuracy but also offers practical insights for detecting oversupplied regions and supporting data-driven urban policy decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u9996\u5c14\u5730\u533aAirbnb\u7684\u6536\u5165\u3001\u9884\u8ba2\u5929\u6570\u548c\u9884\u8ba2\u6570\u91cf\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b01\u81f33\u4e2a\u6708\u7684\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u533a\u57df\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u518d\u7ed3\u5408RNN\u3001LSTM\u548cTransformer\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u65f6\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e73\u5747RMSE\u548cMAE\u4e0a\u5747\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea648%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u623f\u6e90\u8fc7\u5269\u533a\u57df\u548c\u5236\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u77ed\u79df\u5e73\u53f0\u5982Airbnb\u7684\u6269\u5f20\u5bf9\u672c\u5730\u4f4f\u623f\u5e02\u573a\u9020\u6210\u663e\u8457\u51b2\u51fb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u79df\u91d1\u4e0a\u6da8\u548c\u4f4f\u623f\u53ef\u8d1f\u62c5\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u57df\u7ea7Airbnb\u5e02\u573a\u8d8b\u52bf\u5bf9\u4e8e\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u548c\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u5212\u8005\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u623f\u6e90\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u533a\u57df\u5c42\u9762\u7efc\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u73af\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u6574\u5408\u5206\u6790\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6e90\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u7a7a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u672a\u67651-3\u4e2a\u6708\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u5c06\u623f\u6e90\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u57ce\u5e02\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u7b49\u5916\u90e8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u56e0\u7d20\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u533a\u57df\u8868\u5f81\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u63d0\u793a\u5f0f\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u533a\u57df\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5d4c\u5165\u8f93\u5165\u81f3RNN\u3001LSTM\u548cTransformer\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u65f6\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9996\u5c14Airbnb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747RMSE\u548cMAE\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea648%\uff1b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u5177\u5907\u8bc6\u522b\u533a\u57df\u623f\u6e90\u4f9b\u5e94\u8fc7\u5269\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u878d\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5148\u8fdb\u65f6\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u57ce\u5e02\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u5e94\u5bf9\u77ed\u671f\u79df\u8d41\u5e02\u573a\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u53ca\u65f6\u7684\u516c\u5171\u653f\u7b56\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

Despite this momentum, there exists no publicly available application-specific model evaluation that caters to Africa's linguistic diversity. We present AfriSpeech-MultiBench, the first domain-specific evaluation suite for over 100 African English accents across 10+ countries and seven application domains: Finance, Legal, Medical, General dialogue, Call Center, Named Entities and Hallucination Robustness. We benchmark a diverse range of open, closed, unimodal ASR and multimodal LLM-based speech recognition systems using both spontaneous and non-spontaneous speech conversation drawn from various open African accented English speech datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals systematic variation: open-source ASR models excels in spontaneous speech contexts but degrades on noisy, non-native dialogue; multimodal LLMs are more accent-robust yet struggle with domain-specific named entities; proprietary models deliver high accuracy on clean speech but vary significantly by country and domain. Models fine-tuned on African English achieve competitive accuracy with lower latency, a practical advantage for deployment, hallucinations still remain a big problem for most SOTA models.

We show that self-attention emerges from projecting corpus-level co-occurrence statistics into sequence context. Starting from the co-occurrence matrix underlying GloVe embeddings, we demonstrate how the projection naturally captures contextual influence, with the query-key-value mechanism arising as the natural asymmetric extension for modeling directional relationships. Positional encodings and multi-head attention then follow as structured refinements of this same projection principle.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks. Despite promising success, current LLM-based KGR methods still face two critical limitations. First, existing methods often extract reasoning paths indiscriminately, without assessing their different importance, which may introduce irrelevant noise that misleads LLMs. Second, while many methods leverage LLMs to dynamically explore potential reasoning paths, they require high retrieval demands and frequent LLM calls. To address these limitations, we propose PathMind, a novel framework designed to enhance faithful and interpretable reasoning by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths. Specifically, PathMind follows a \"Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason\" paradigm. First, it retrieves a query subgraph from KG through the retrieval module. Next, it introduces a path prioritization mechanism that identifies important reasoning paths using a semantic-aware path priority function, which simultaneously considers the accumulative cost and the estimated future cost for reaching the target. Finally, PathMind generates accurate and logically consistent responses via a dual-phase training strategy, including task-specific instruction tuning and path-wise preference alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PathMind consistently outperforms competitive baselines, particularly on complex reasoning tasks with fewer input tokens, by identifying essential reasoning paths.", "AI": {"tldr": "PathMind \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u2018\u68c0\u7d22-\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f-\u63a8\u7406\u2019\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684KGR\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8def\u5f84\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u5f53\u548c\u9ad8\u8c03\u7528\u6210\u672c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u51fd\u6570\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4ee5\u66f4\u5c11\u8f93\u5165\u6807\u8bb0\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u76f2\u76ee\u63d0\u53d6\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u5173\u566a\u58f0\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u52a8\u6001\u63a2\u7d22\u8def\u5f84\u9700\u8981\u9891\u7e41\u8c03\u7528LLM\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u68c0\u7d22\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "PathMind\u91c7\u7528\u2018\u68c0\u7d22-\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f-\u63a8\u7406\u2019\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u5757\u83b7\u53d6\u67e5\u8be2\u5b50\u56fe\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u8003\u8651\u7d2f\u79ef\u4ee3\u4ef7\u4e0e\u672a\u6765\u9884\u671f\u4ee3\u4ef7\uff0c\u7b5b\u9009\u91cd\u8981\u8def\u5f84\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u8def\u5f84\u7ea7\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPathMind\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u4e14\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u6807\u8bb0\u5373\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PathMind\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u8def\u5f84\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709LLM-KGR\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\u4e0e\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u4fe1\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

During compression training, entropy decreases, leading to shorter reasoning but limited exploration, while accuracy-oriented objectives increase entropy, lengthening reasoning chains. This can cause the model to get stuck in a local dilemma. Our analysis further reveals the origin of the entropy conflict: many high-entropy tokens are logical connectors that receive larger gradients and are encouraged under the performance objective, while the compression objective simultaneously penalizes these potentially redundant connectors. This opposing pressure creates a direct source of entropy conflict. To address these issues, we adopt an entropy-guided training framework. As entropy descends, the model is guided toward efficient reasoning by encouraging concise thought steps; as entropy rises, exploration is reinforced under the compact reasoning mode to improve robustness. Experiments on six mathematical benchmarks show that our method compresses reasoning length to 20% of the original while maintaining or even surpassing baseline accuracy.

A central task is Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking (MCVT), which generates vehicle trajectories and enables applications such as anomaly detection, traffic density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, most existing studies on MCVT emphasize accuracy while overlooking real-time performance and scalability. These two aspects are essential for real-world deployment and become increasingly challenging in city-scale applications as the number of cameras grows. To address this issue, we propose SAE-MCVT, the first scalable real-time MCVT framework. The system includes several edge devices that interact with one central workstation separately. On the edge side, live RTSP video streams are serialized and processed through modules including object detection, object tracking, geo-mapping, and feature extraction. Only lightweight metadata -- vehicle locations and deep appearance features -- are transmitted to the central workstation. On the central side, cross-camera association is calculated under the constraint of spatial-temporal relations between adjacent cameras, which are learned through a self-supervised camera link model. Experiments on the RoundaboutHD dataset show that SAE-MCVT maintains real-time operation on 2K 15 FPS video streams and achieves an IDF1 score of 61.2.

With the strong generation capabilities of LLMs, research has focused on generating verbalized confidence. This is further enhanced by combining chain-of-thought reasoning, which provides logical and transparent estimation. However, how reasoning strategies affect the estimated confidence is still under-explored. In this work, we demonstrate that predicting a verbalized probability distribution can effectively encourage in-depth reasoning for confidence estimation. Intuitively, it requires an LLM to consider all candidates within the answer space instead of basing on a single guess, and to carefully assign confidence scores to meet the requirements of a distribution. This method shows an advantage across different models and various tasks, regardless of whether the answer space is known. Its advantage is maintained even after reinforcement learning, and further analysis shows its reasoning patterns are aligned with human expectations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u53e3\u8bed\u5316\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u4f30\u8ba1\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4fc3\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5168\u9762\u8003\u8651\u7b54\u6848\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5019\u9009\uff0c\u5e76\u5408\u7406\u5206\u914d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e5f\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9884\u671f\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u65f6\uff0c\u867d\u5df2\u7ed3\u5408\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u900f\u660e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4ecd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8ba9\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u4e2a\u53e3\u8bed\u5316\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f3a\u5236\u5176\u5728\u56de\u7b54\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5168\u9762\u8003\u8651\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u9009\u9879\uff0c\u5e76\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5206\u914d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u7b54\u6848\u7a7a\u95f4\u662f\u5426\u5df2\u77e5\uff1b\u5373\u4f7f\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4f18\u52bf\u4f9d\u7136\u5b58\u5728\uff1b\u4e14\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f4\u89c9\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u6d4b\u53e3\u8bed\u5316\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u3001\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Large language models appear to bring this vision closer, showing impressive results in automatically generating models for classical benchmarks. However, much of this apparent success may derive from data contamination rather than genuine reasoning: many standard CP problems are likely included in the training data of these models. To examine this hypothesis, we systematically rephrased and perturbed a set of well-known CSPLib problems to preserve their structure while modifying their context and introducing misleading elements. We then compared the models produced by three representative LLMs across original and modified descriptions.

The benchmark spans five core categories: grammar, morphology, spelling, reading comprehension, and syntax, through 150 expert-designed multiple choice questions that directly assess structural language understanding. Evaluating 35 Arabic and bilingual LLMs reveals that current models demonstrate strong surface level proficiency but struggle with deeper grammatical and syntactic reasoning. AraLingBench highlights a persistent gap between high scores on knowledge-based benchmarks and true linguistic mastery, showing that many models succeed through memorization or pattern recognition rather than authentic comprehension. By isolating and measuring fundamental linguistic skills, AraLingBench provides a diagnostic framework for developing Arabic LLMs. The full evaluation code is publicly available on GitHub.", "AI": {"tldr": "AraLingBench \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u6db5\u76d6\u8bed\u6cd5\u3001\u5f62\u6001\u3001\u62fc\u5199\u3001\u9605\u8bfb\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u53e5\u6cd5\u4e94\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5305\u542b150\u9053\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u76f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bed\u8a00\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5bf935\u4e2a\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u53ca\u53cc\u8bedLLMs\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5728\u8868\u5c42\u5c42\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6df1\u5c42\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u53e5\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u9ad8\u5206\u4e0e\u771f\u6b63\u8bed\u8a00\u638c\u63e1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8bb8\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6216\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u7406\u89e3\u3002AraLingBench \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bedLLMs\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u5b8c\u6574\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u516c\u5f00\u4e8eGitHub\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8861\u91cf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u4e2d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6df1\u5c42\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u53e5\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u4e3a\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u8bed\u8a00\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6db5\u76d6\u4e94\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff1a\u8bed\u6cd5\u3001\u5f62\u6001\u3001\u62fc\u5199\u3001\u9605\u8bfb\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u53e5\u6cd5\uff1b\u7531\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbe\u8ba1150\u9053\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u9898\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u95ee\u9898\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u89e3\uff1b\u5bf935\u4e2a\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u53ca\u53cc\u8bed\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8868\u9762\u5c42\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u6df1\u5c42\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u53e5\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6216\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u6709\u6548\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "AraLingBench \u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u53ef\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u5b83\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6df1\u5c42\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u6ce8\u91cd\u8bed\u8a00\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u89e3\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u53ca\u5176\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u5c06\u4fc3\u8fdb\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, we find that reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuned CoT reasoning can paradoxically degrade performance in Visual Grounding tasks, particularly as CoT outputs become lengthy or complex. Additionally, our analysis reveals that increased dataset size does not always enhance performance due to varying data complexities. Motivated by these findings, we propose Curriculum-based Relative Policy Optimization (CuRPO), a novel training strategy that leverages CoT length and generalized Intersection over Union (gIoU) rewards as complexity indicators to progressively structure training data from simpler to more challenging examples. Extensive experiments on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and LISA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. CuRPO consistently outperforms existing methods, including Visual-RFT, with notable improvements of up to +12.52 mAP on RefCOCO. Moreover, CuRPO exhibits exceptional efficiency and robustness, delivering strong localization performance even in few-shot learning scenarios, particularly benefiting tasks characterized by ambiguous and intricate textual descriptions.The code is released on https://github.com/qyoung-yan/CuRPO.", "AI": {"tldr": "CuRPO\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528CoT\u957f\u5ea6\u548cgIoU\u5956\u52b1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u5230\u590d\u6742\u5730\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d1\u73b0RL\u5fae\u8c03\u7684CoT\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u8f93\u51fa\u8fc7\u957f\u6216\u590d\u6742\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u589e\u5927\u4e0d\u603b\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCuRPO\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CoT\u957f\u5ea6\u548cgIoU\u4f5c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6307\u793a\u5668\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u5230\u590d\u6742\u9010\u6b65\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728RefCOCO\u3001RefCOCO+\u3001RefCOCOg\u548cLISA\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCuRPO\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe+12.52 mAP\uff1b\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CuRPO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Although the current post hoc explanation methods offer valuable insights into feature importance, they are inherently disconnected from the model training process, limiting their faithfulness and utility. In this work, we introduce a novel differentiable approach to global explainability by design, integrating feature importance estimation directly into model training. Central to our method is the ScoresActivation function, a feature-ranking mechanism embedded within the learning pipeline. This integration enables models to prioritize features according to their contribution to predictive performance in a differentiable and end-to-end trainable manner. Evaluations across benchmark datasets show that our approach yields globally faithful, stable feature rankings aligned with SHAP values and ground-truth feature importance, while maintaining high predictive performance. Moreover, feature scoring is 150 times faster than the classical SHAP method, requiring only 2 seconds during training compared to SHAP's 300 seconds for feature ranking in the same configuration. Our method also improves classification accuracy by 11.24% with 10 features (5 relevant) and 29.33% with 16 features (5 relevant, 11 irrelevant), demonstrating robustness to irrelevant inputs.

This study examines how incorporating pluralistic values affects LLM behavior by systematically evaluating demographic variation and design parameters in the alignment pipeline. We collected alignment data from US and German participants (N = 1,095, 27,375 ratings) who rated LLM responses across five dimensions: Toxicity, Emotional Awareness (EA), Sensitivity, Stereotypical Bias, and Helpfulness. We fine-tuned multiple Large Language Models and Large Reasoning Models using preferences from different social groups while varying rating scales, disagreement handling methods, and optimization techniques. The results revealed systematic demographic effects: male participants rated responses 18% less toxic than female participants; conservative and Black participants rated responses 27.9% and 44% more emotionally aware than liberal and White participants, respectively. Models fine-tuned on group-specific preferences exhibited distinct behaviors. Technical design choices showed strong effects: the preservation of rater disagreement achieved roughly 53% greater toxicity reduction than majority voting, and 5-point scales yielded about 22% more reduction than binary formats; and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) consistently outperformed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in multi-value optimization. These findings represent a preliminary step in answering a critical question: How should alignment balance expert-driven and user-driven signals to ensure both safety and fair representation?", "AI":

While existing works primarily focus on assessing how well LLMs adhere to user instructions, they often overlook scenarios where instructions contain conflicting constraints-a common occurrence in complex prompts. The behavior of LLMs under such conditions remains under-explored. To bridge this gap, we introduce ConInstruct, a benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs' ability to detect and resolve conflicts within user instructions. Using this dataset, we evaluate LLMs' conflict detection performance and analyze their conflict resolution behavior. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) Most proprietary LLMs exhibit strong conflict detection capabilities, whereas among open-source models, only DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates similarly strong performance. DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-4.5-Sonnet achieve the highest average F1-scores at 91.5% and 87.3%, respectively, ranking first and second overall. (2) Despite their strong conflict detection abilities, LLMs rarely explicitly notify users about the conflicts or request clarification when faced with conflicting constraints. These results underscore a critical shortcoming in current LLMs and highlight an important area for future improvement when designing instruction-following LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faConInstruct\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0b\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dDeepSeek-R1\u548cClaude-4.5-Sonnet\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff08F1\u5206\u6570\u5206\u522b\u4e3a91.5%\u548c87.3%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u51b2\u7a81\u540e\u672a\u4e3b\u52a8\u544a\u77e5\u7528\u6237\u6216\u8bf7\u6c42\u6f84\u6e05\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u51fa\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8LLMs\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u9075\u5faa\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5374\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u6307\u4ee4\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u51b2\u7a81\u7ea6\u675f\u60c5\u5883\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u51b2\u7a81\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaConInstruct\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540cLLMs\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u5176\u54cd\u5e94\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "1. \u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u666e\u904d\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u51b2\u7a81\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ec5DeepSeek-R1\u5728\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\uff1b2. \u5c3d\u7ba1\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u4f46\u7edd\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u4e3b\u52a8\u63d0\u9192\u7528\u6237\u6216\u8bf7\u6c42\u6f84\u6e05\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u673a\u5236\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u53cd\u9988\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u9762\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u91cd\u70b9\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u3001\u77db\u76fe\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0b\u7684\u900f\u660e\u6027\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We identify a major bottleneck:the long-tail distribution of rollout lengths, where a small fraction of long generations dominates wall clock time and a complementary opportunity; the availability of historical rollouts that reveal stable prompt level patterns across training epochs. Motivated by these observations, we propose DAS, a Distribution Aware Speculative decoding framework that accelerates RL rollouts without altering model outputs. DAS integrates two key ideas: an adaptive, nonparametric drafter built from recent rollouts using an incrementally maintained suffix tree, and a length aware speculation policy that allocates more aggressive draft budgets to long trajectories that dominate makespan. This design exploits rollout history to sustain acceptance while balancing base and token level costs during decoding. Experiments on math and code reasoning tasks show that DAS reduces rollout time up to 50% while preserving identical training curves, demonstrating that distribution-aware speculative decoding can significantly accelerate RL post training without compromising learning quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "DAS\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u56de\u6eda\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u8d77\u8349\u5668\u548c\u957f\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u56de\u6eda\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c1150%\u7684\u56de\u6eda\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u5b66\u4e60\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "RL\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u56de\u6eda\u9636\u6bb5\u56e0\u957f\u8f68\u8ff9\u9010\u8bcd\u751f\u6210\u800c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u56de\u6eda\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5c11\u6570\u957f\u8f68\u8ff9\u5360\u636e\u5927\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5386\u53f2\u56de\u6eda\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u9690\u85cf\u7740\u63d0\u793a\u7ea7\u522b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDAS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u589e\u91cf\u7ef4\u62a4\u540e\u7f00\u6811\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u8d77\u8349\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6839\u636e\u8f68\u8ff9\u957f\u5ea6\u5206\u914d\u66f4\u6fc0\u8fdb\u8349\u6848\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5e73\u8861\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u5206\u8bcd\u7ea7\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cDAS\u5c06\u56de\u6eda\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c1150%\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5b8c\u5168\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u52a0\u901fRL\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5e03\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u56de\u6eda\u6570\u636e\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u63a8\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Procedural Warm-Up for Vision Transformers", "comment": null, "summary": "Transformers show remarkable versatility across domains, suggesting the existence of inductive biases beneficial across modalities. In this work, we explore a new way to instil such generic biases in vision transformers (ViTs) by pretraining on procedurally-generated data devoid of visual or semantic content. We generate this data with simple algorithms such as formal grammars, so the results bear no relationship to either natural or synthetic images. We use this procedurally-generated data to pretrain ViTs in a warm-up phase that bypasses their visual patch embedding mechanisms, thus encouraging the models to internalise abstract computational priors. When followed by standard image-based training, this warm-up significantly improves data efficiency, convergence speed, and downstream performance. On ImageNet-1k for example, allocating just 1% of the training budget to procedural data improves final accuracy by over 1.7%. In terms of its effect on performance, 1% procedurally generated data is thus equivalent to 28% of the ImageNet-1k data. These findings suggest a promising path toward new data-efficient and domain-agnostic pretraining strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u65e0\u89c6\u89c9\u6216\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08ViTs\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f15\u5165\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u901a\u7528\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bed\u6cd5\u7b49\u7b80\u5355\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed5\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u8865\u4e01\u5d4c\u5165\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u62bd\u8c61\u8ba1\u7b97\u5148\u9a8c\u3002\u8be5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3001\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728ImageNet-1k\u4e0a\u4ec5\u75281%\u7684\u9884\u7b97\u5373\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc71.7%\uff0c\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e28%\u7684ImageNet\u6570\u636e\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u65e0\u89c6\u89c9\u6216\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3ViTs\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bed\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8df3\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u8865\u4e01\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u62bd\u8c61\u8ba1\u7b97\u5148\u9a8c\u3002\u968f\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u51c6\u56fe\u50cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet-1k\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ec5\u75281%\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u53ef\u4f7f\u6700\u7ec8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc71.7%\uff0c\u5176\u6548\u679c\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e28%\u7684ImageNet\u6570\u636e\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3001\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u901a\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Traditional CIL methods, which do not leverage pre-trained models (PTMs), suffer from catastrophic forgetting (CF) due to the need to incrementally learn both feature representations and the classifier. The integration of PTMs into CIL has recently led to efficient approaches that treat the PTM as a fixed feature extractor combined with analytic classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, they still face a major limitation: the inability to continually adapt feature representations to best suit the CIL tasks, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose AnaCP (Analytic Contrastive Projection), a novel method that preserves the efficiency of analytic classifiers while enabling incremental feature adaptation without gradient-based training, thereby eliminating the CF caused by gradient updates.

Yet converting unstructured educational materials, such as lecture notes and slides, into KGs that capture key pedagogical content remains difficult. We propose a framework for knowledge graph construction and refinement grounded in rate-distortion (RD) theory and optimal transport geometry. In the framework, lecture content is modeled as a metric-measure space, capturing semantic and relational structure, while candidate KGs are aligned using Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) couplings to quantify semantic distortion. The rate term, expressed via the size of KG, reflects complexity and compactness. Refinement operators (add, merge, split, remove, rewire) minimize the rate-distortion Lagrangian, yielding compact, information-preserving KGs.

Concurrently, existing high-difficulty benchmarks often suffer from narrow disciplinary focus, oversimplified answer formats, and vulnerability to data contamination, creating a fidelity gap with real-world scientific inquiry. To address these challenges, we introduce ATLAS (AGI-Oriented Testbed for Logical Application in Science), a large-scale, high-difficulty, and cross-disciplinary evaluation suite composed of approximately 800 original problems. Developed by domain experts (PhD-level and above), ATLAS spans seven core scientific fields: mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, earth science, and materials science. Its key features include: (1) High Originality and Contamination Resistance, with all questions newly created or substantially adapted to prevent test data leakage; (2) Cross-Disciplinary Focus, designed to assess models' ability to integrate knowledge and reason across scientific domains; (3) High-Fidelity Answers, prioritizing complex, open-ended answers involving multi-step reasoning and LaTeX-formatted expressions over simple multiple-choice questions; and (4) Rigorous Quality Control, employing a multi-stage process of expert peer review and adversarial testing to ensure question difficulty, scientific value, and correctness. We also propose a robust evaluation paradigm using a panel of LLM judges for automated, nuanced assessment of complex answers. Preliminary results on leading models demonstrate ATLAS's effectiveness in differentiating their advanced scientific reasoning capabilities.

In this work, we propose AutoTool, a novel graph-based framework that bypasses repeated LLM inference by exploiting a key empirical observation: tool usage inertia - the tendency of tool invocations to follow predictable sequential patterns. AutoTool constructs a directed graph from historical agent trajectories, where nodes represent tools and edges capture transition probabilities, effectively modeling the inertia in tool selection. It further integrates parameter-level information to refine tool input generation. By traversing this structured representation, AutoTool efficiently selects tools and their parameters with minimal reliance on LLM inference. Extensive experiments across diverse agent tasks demonstrate that AutoTool reduces inference costs by up to 30% while maintaining competitive task completion rates, offering a practical and scalable enhancement for inference-heavy frameworks. Our work highlights the promise of integrating statistical structure into LLM agent design for greater efficiency without sacrificing performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "AutoTool proposes a graph-based framework to reduce inference costs in LLM agents by leveraging tool usage inertia\u2014predictable sequential patterns in tool selection.

To mitigate it, we propose normalized contextual calibration (NCC), an effective method that normalizes and calibrates predictions at the full-label level. NCC achieves statistically significant improvements over prior approaches across multiple datasets and models, with gains of up to 10% F1. Moreover, NCC extends bias mitigation to broader tasks such as multiple-choice question answering. Our analysis shows that, when combined with in-context learning, NCC is less sensitive to few-shot example selection, requires fewer examples for competitive performance, and produces more reliable confidence estimates. These findings highlight the importance of mitigating full-label biases to improve the performance and robustness of LLM-based methods, particularly in real-world applications where class labels naturally consist of multiple tokens.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6821\u51c6\uff08NCC\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7f13\u89e3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6807\u8bb0\u7c7b\u522b\u6807\u7b7e\u4e2d\u56e0\u6807\u7b7e\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u540c\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u957f\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002NCC\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5b8c\u6574\u6807\u7b7e\u5c42\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u548c\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0cF1\u5f97\u5206\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe10%\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5bf9\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u793a\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u9009\u9898\u95ee\u7b54\u7b49\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5019\u9009\u9009\u9879\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u591a\u6807\u8bb0\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6821\u51c6\uff08NCC\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5b8c\u6574\u6807\u7b7e\u5c42\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4e0e\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u6807\u7b7e\u957f\u5ea6\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "NCC\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6700\u5927F1\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe10%\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6d88\u9664\u5b8c\u6574\u6807\u7b7e\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0cNCC\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We therefore propose MargNet, incorporating successful algorithmic designs of statistical models into neural networks.

However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks, which can compromise safety alignment and lead to harmful outputs. Existing studies mainly focus on general safety evaluations, with limited attention to the unique safety requirements of educational scenarios. To address this gap, we construct EduHarm, a benchmark containing safe-unsafe instruction pairs across five representative educational scenarios, enabling systematic safety evaluation of educational LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage shield framework (TSSF) for educational LLMs that simultaneously mitigates both jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks. First, safety-aware attention realignment redirects attention toward critical unsafe tokens, thereby restoring the harmfulness feature that discriminates between unsafe and safe inputs. Second, layer-wise safety judgment identifies harmfulness features by aggregating safety cues across multiple layers to detect unsafe instructions. Finally, defense-driven dual routing separates safe and unsafe queries, ensuring normal processing for benign inputs and guarded responses for harmful ones. Extensive experiments across eight jailbreak attack strategies demonstrate that TSSF effectively strengthens safety while preventing over-refusal of benign queries. Evaluations on three fine-tuning attack datasets further show that it consistently achieves robust defense against harmful queries while maintaining preserving utility gains from benign fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e86EduHarm\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e94\u4e2a\u5178\u578b\u6559\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b89\u5168-\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u4ee4\u5bf9\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6559\u80b2\u7c7b\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u9632\u62a4\u6846\u67b6\uff08TSSF\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u3001\u5206\u5c42\u5b89\u5168\u5224\u65ad\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u9a71\u52a8\u53cc\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u62b5\u5fa1\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTSSF\u5728\u516b\u79cd\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8bef\u62d2\u826f\u6027\u67e5\u8be2\uff1b\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u5fae\u8c03\u653b\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u901a\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u6559\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u7279\u6709\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u6559\u80b2\u7c7b\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u53d7\u8d8a\u72f1\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u5931\u6548\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u6709\u5bb3\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u9632\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u76fe\u6784\u6846\u67b6\uff08TSSF\uff09\uff1a1\uff09\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u5371\u9669\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u6709\u5bb3\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2\uff09\u5206\u5c42\u5b89\u5168\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u591a\u5c42\u5b89\u5168\u7ebf\u7d22\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u6709\u5bb3\u6307\u4ee4\uff1b3\uff09\u9632\u5fa1\u9a71\u52a8\u53cc\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u826f\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u6b63\u5e38\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u6709\u5bb3\u8f93\u5165\u83b7\u5f97\u53d7\u63a7\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u57288\u79cd\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\uff0cTSSF\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62d2\u7edd\u826f\u6027\u8bf7\u6c42\uff1b\u57283\u4e2a\u5fae\u8c03\u653b\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u6709\u5bb3\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u826f\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "EduHarm\u57fa\u51c6\u548cTSSF\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6559\u80b2\u7c7b\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u9632\u62a4\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u8d8a\u72f1\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u969c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Today's models specialize for an individual sport, and suffer from the high cost and scarcity of expert-level supervision across the long tail of sports. Towards closing that gap, we explore transferable video representations for skill assessment. Our CrossTrainer approach discovers skill-attributes, such as balance, control, and hand positioning -- whose meaning transcends the boundaries of any given sport, then trains a multimodal language model to generate actionable feedback for a novel video, e.g., \"lift hands more to generate more power\" as well as its proficiency level, e.g., early expert. We validate the new model on multiple datasets for both cross-sport (transfer) and intra-sport (in-domain) settings, where it achieves gains up to 60% relative to the state of the art. By abstracting out the shared behaviors indicative of human skill, the proposed video representation generalizes substantially better than an array of existing techniques, enriching today's multimodal large language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCrossTrainer\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d1\u73b0\u8de8\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6280\u80fd\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u624b\u90e8\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff09\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u6280\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u540c\u8fd0\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534760%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6280\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u957f\u5c3e\u8fd0\u52a8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u8de8\u8fd0\u52a8\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCrossTrainer\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u53d1\u73b0\u8de8\u8fd0\u52a8\u901a\u7528\u6280\u80fd\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c5e\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u65b0\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u53cd\u9988\u4e0e\u6280\u80fd\u7b49\u7ea7\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8de8\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u540c\u8fd0\u52a8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5bf9\u589e\u76ca\u9ad8\u8fbe60%\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u62bd\u8c61\u5171\u901a\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6280\u80fd\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6280\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8de8\u8fd0\u52a8\u6280\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We present MedBench v4, a nationwide, cloud-based benchmarking infrastructure comprising over 700,000 expert-curated tasks spanning 24 primary and 91 secondary specialties, with dedicated tracks for LLMs, multimodal models, and agents. Items undergo multi-stage refinement and multi-round review by clinicians from more than 500 institutions, and open-ended responses are scored by an LLM-as-a-judge calibrated to human ratings. We evaluate 15 frontier models. Base LLMs reach a mean overall score of 54.1/100 (best: Claude Sonnet 4.5, 62.5/100), but safety and ethics remain low (18.4/100). Multimodal models perform worse overall (mean 47.5/100; best: GPT-5, 54.9/100), with solid perception yet weaker cross-modal reasoning. Agents built on the same backbones substantially improve end-to-end performance (mean 79.8/100), with Claude Sonnet 4.5-based agents achieving up to 85.3/100 overall and 88.9/100 on safety tasks. MedBench v4 thus reveals persisting gaps in multimodal reasoning and safety for base models, while showing that governance-aware agentic orchestration can markedly enhance benchmarked clinical readiness without sacrificing capability.

While optical sensors such as RGB and LiDAR offer high spatial fidelity, they suffer from severe occlusions and introduce privacy risks in indoor environments. In contrast, millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar preserves privacy and penetrates obstacles, but its inherently low spatial resolution makes reliable geometric reasoning difficult.\n  We introduce RISE, the first benchmark and system for single-static-radar indoor scene understanding, jointly targeting layout reconstruction and object detection. RISE is built upon the key insight that multipath reflections, traditionally treated as noise, encode rich geometric cues. To exploit this, we propose a Bi-Angular Multipath Enhancement that explicitly models Angle-of-Arrival and Angle-of-Departure to recover secondary (ghost) reflections and reveal invisible structures. On top of these enhanced observations, a simulation-to-reality Hierarchical Diffusion framework transforms fragmented radar responses into complete layout reconstruction and object detection.\n  Our benchmark contains 50,000 frames collected across 100 real indoor trajectories, forming the first large-scale dataset dedicated to radar-based indoor scene understanding. Extensive experiments show that RISE reduces the Chamfer Distance by 60% (down to 16 cm) compared to the state of the art in layout reconstruction, and delivers the first mmWave-based object detection, achieving 58% IoU. These results establish RISE as a new foundation for geometry-aware and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding using a single static radar.", "AI": {"tldr": "RISE \u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u9759\u6001\u96f7\u8fbe\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u53cd\u5c04\uff08\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u89c6\u4e3a\u566a\u58f0\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u89d2\u5ea6\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u4e8c\u6b21\u53cd\u5c04\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u9690\u85cf\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b 50,000 \u5e27\u3001100 \u6761\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRISE \u5728\u5e03\u5c40\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0a\u5c06 Chamfer \u8ddd\u79bb\u964d\u4f4e 60%\uff08\u964d\u81f3 16 \u5398\u7c73\uff09\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u4e0b\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230 58% IoU\uff0c\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u4e14\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5149\u5b66\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff08\u5982 RGB\u3001LiDAR\uff09\u867d\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\u4e14\u5728\u5ba4\u5185\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e26\u6765\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u800c\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u867d\u5177\u5907\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u7a7f\u900f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4f4e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5bfc\u81f4\u96be\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u9690\u79c1\u53c8\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Bi-Angular Multipath Enhancement \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u5230\u8fbe\u89d2\uff08AoA\uff09\u4e0e\u51fa\u53d1\u89d2\uff08AoD\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u4e8c\u6b21\u53cd\u5c04\uff08\u9b3c\u5f71\uff09\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528 Simulation-to-Reality Hierarchical Diffusion \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u788e\u7247\u5316\u7684\u96f7\u8fbe\u54cd\u5e94\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e03\u5c40\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cChamfer Distance \u964d\u4f4e 60%\uff08\u964d\u81f3 16 \u5398\u7c73\uff09\uff1b\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e mmWave \u96f7\u8fbe\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230 58% \u7684 IoU\u3002", "conclusion": "RISE \u6210\u529f\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u9759\u6001\u96f7\u8fbe\u7684\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u53cd\u5c04\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u667a\u80fd\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We systematically examine how varying BR from 0.2 to 5.0 affects RF performance across 39 heterogeneous regression datasets and 16 RF configurations, evaluating with repeated two-fold cross-validation and mean squared error. Our results demonstrate that tuning the BR can yield significant improvements over the default: the best setup relied on BR \\leq 1.0 for 24 datasets, BR > 1.0 for 15, and BR = 1.0 was optimal in 4 cases only. We establish a link between dataset characteristics and the preferred BR: datasets with strong global feature-target relationships favor higher BRs, while those with higher local target variance benefit from lower BRs. To further investigate this relationship, we conducted experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled noise levels. These experiments reproduce the observed bias-variance trade-off: in low-noise scenarios, higher BRs effectively reduce model bias, whereas in high-noise settings, lower BRs help reduce model variance. Overall, BR is an influential hyperparameter that should be tuned to optimize RF regression models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a9\u91c7\u6837\u7387\uff08BR\uff09\u57280.2\u52305.0\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8c03\u6574BR\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u591a\u6570\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6700\u4f18BR\u4e0d\u7b49\u4e8e\u9ed8\u8ba4\u503c1.0\uff0c\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u51b3\u5b9a\u6700\u4f73BR\uff1a\u5168\u5c40\u5173\u7cfb\u5f3a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9002\u5408\u9ad8BR\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u65b9\u5dee\u5927\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9002\u5408\u4f4eBR\u3002\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0eBR\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u9ed8\u8ba4\u81ea\u52a9\u91c7\u6837\u7387\uff08BR\uff09\u4e3a1.0\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u8bbe\u7f6e\u672a\u5fc5\u6700\u4f18\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540cBR\u5bf9\u56de\u5f52\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u3002", "method": "\u572839\u4e2a\u5f02\u6784\u56de\u5f52\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u752816\u79cd\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u914d\u7f6e\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u590d\u4e24\u6298\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6d4b\u8bd5BR\u4ece0.2\u52305.0\u7684\u53d6\u503c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81-\u76ee\u6807\u5173\u7cfb\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u76ee\u6807\u65b9\u5dee\uff09\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18BR\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u63a7\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u6743\u8861\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728BR \u2264 1.0\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c15\u4e2a\u5728BR > 1.0\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4ec54\u4e2a\u5728BR = 1.0\u65f6\u6700\u4f18\u3002\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u9ad8BR\u964d\u4f4e\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4f4eBR\u964d\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u3002\u8868\u660eBR\u662f\u5173\u952e\u53ef\u8c03\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u52a9\u91c7\u6837\u7387\uff08BR\uff09\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u56de\u5f52\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e94\u6839\u636e\u6570\u636e\u7279\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e3a1.0\u3002\u5408\u7406\u9009\u62e9BR\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is considered a key technology with significant potential for training such Agents; however, the effective application of RL to LLM Agents is still in its nascent stages and faces considerable challenges. Currently, this emerging field lacks in-depth exploration into RL approaches specifically tailored for the LLM Agent context, alongside a scarcity of flexible and easily extensible training frameworks designed for this purpose. To help advance this area, this paper first revisits and clarifies Reinforcement Learning methodologies for LLM Agents by systematically extending the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to comprehensively define the key components of an LLM Agent. Secondly, we introduce Agent-R1, a modular, flexible, and user-friendly training framework for RL-based LLM Agents, designed for straightforward adaptation across diverse task scenarios and interactive environments. We conducted experiments on Multihop QA benchmark tasks, providing initial validation for the effectiveness of our proposed methods and framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08MDP\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u660e\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u7528\u6237\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6Agent-R1\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u914d\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u5904\u4e8e\u521d\u7ea7\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08MDP\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5b9a\u4e49LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u8981\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aAgent-R1\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u5411\u66f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Missing plane orientation metadata can complicate analysis, increase domain shift when merging heterogeneous datasets, and reduce accuracy of diagnostic classifiers. This study develops a classifier that accurately generates plane orientation metadata. We adopt a 2.5D context-aware model that leverages multi-slice information to avoid ambiguity from isolated slices and enable robust feature learning. We train the 2.5D model on both 3D slice sequences and static 2D images. While our 2D reference model achieves 98.74% accuracy, our 2.5D method raises this to 99.49%, reducing errors by 60%, highlighting the importance of 2.5D context. We validate the utility of our generated metadata in a brain tumor detection task. A gated strategy selectively uses metadata-enhanced predictions based on uncertainty scores, boosting accuracy from 97.0% with an image-only model to 98.0%, reducing misdiagnoses by 33.3%.

We introduce the LiveRAG benchmark, a publicly available dataset of 895 synthetic questions and answers designed to support systematic evaluation of RAG-based Q&A systems. This synthetic benchmark is derived from the one used during the SIGIR'2025 LiveRAG Challenge, where competitors were evaluated under strict time constraints. It is augmented with information that was not made available to competitors during the Challenge, such as the ground-truth answers, together with their associated supporting claims which were used for evaluating competitors' answers.

Also, in conventional AL, annotation effort is a function of the ROI- larger regions make the task cognitively easier but incur higher annotation costs, whereas smaller regions demand finer precision and more attention from the expert. In this context, language guidance provides an effective alternative, requiring minimal expert effort while bypassing the cognitively demanding task of precise boundary delineation in segmentation. Towards this goal, we introduce LINGUAL: a framework that receives natural language instructions from an expert, translates them into executable programs through in-context learning, and automatically performs the corresponding sequence of sub-tasks without any human intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LINGUAL in active domain adaptation (ADA) achieving comparable or superior performance to AL baselines while reducing estimated annotation time by approximately 80%.", "AI": {"tldr": "LINGUAL \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u4e13\u5bb6\u6307\u4ee4\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u76f8\u5f53\u4f20\u7edf\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u6807\u6ce8\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea680%\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u8fb9\u754c\u6a21\u7cca\u4e14\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u4e13\u5bb6\u7cbe\u786e\u52fe\u753b\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u8d39\u65f6\u8d39\u529b\u4e14\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u62c5\u91cd\uff1b\u5c0f\u533a\u57df\u867d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4f46\u66f4\u8017\u7cbe\u529b\uff0c\u5927\u533a\u57df\u867d\u6613\u6807\u6ce8\u4f46\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u5bfc\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u6807\u6ce8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e13\u5bb6\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "method": "LINGUAL \u6846\u67b6\u63a5\u6536\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u52a8\u5b8c\u6210\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cLINGUAL \u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6807\u6ce8\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea680%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u6846\u67b6 LINGUAL \u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u9ad8\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, the optimization landscape for SAE training can be challenging due to correlations in the input data. We demonstrate that applying PCA Whitening to input activations -- a standard preprocessing technique in classical sparse coding -- improves SAE performance across multiple metrics. Through theoretical analysis and simulation, we show that whitening transforms the optimization landscape, making it more convex and easier to navigate. We evaluate both ReLU and Top-K SAEs across diverse model architectures, widths, and sparsity regimes. Empirical evaluation on SAEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for sparse autoencoders, reveals that whitening consistently improves interpretability metrics, including sparse probing accuracy and feature disentanglement, despite minor drops in reconstruction quality. Our results challenge the assumption that interpretability aligns with an optimal sparsity--fidelity trade-off and suggest that whitening should be considered as a default preprocessing step for SAE training, particularly when interpretability is prioritized over perfect reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAE\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u524d\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5e94\u7528PCA\u53bb\u76f8\u5173\u5316\uff08whitening\uff09\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u7565\u6709\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u4f18\u5316\u666f\u89c2\u66f4\u51f8\uff0c\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u56e0\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u56f0\u96be\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528PCA Whitening\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30ReLU\u4e0eTop-K SAE\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53bb\u76f8\u5173\u5316\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u63a2\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u8026\u6027\uff0c\u867d\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u8f7b\u5fae\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u6574\u4f53\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u660e\u663e\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53bb\u76f8\u5173\u5316\u5e94\u4f5c\u4e3aSAE\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9ed8\u8ba4\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4ee5\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e3a\u9996\u8981\u76ee\u6807\u65f6\u3002"}}

We investigate techniques to identify the best possible alignment and evaluation method between claim sets, with the aim of providing a reliable evaluation framework. Our approach enables comparison between model-extracted and human-annotated claim sets, serving as a metric for assessing the extraction performance of models and also as a possible measure of inter-annotator agreement. We conduct experiments on newly collected dataset-claims extracted from comments under Czech and Slovak news articles-domains that pose additional challenges due to the informal language, strong local context, and subtleties of these closely related languages. The results draw attention to the limitations of current evaluation approaches when applied to document-level claim extraction and highlight the need for more advanced methods-ones able to correctly capture semantic similarity and evaluate essential claim properties such as atomicity, checkworthiness, and decontextualization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u6587\u6863\u7ea7\u58f0\u660e\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u5206\u6765\u6bd4\u8f83\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u58f0\u660e\u96c6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u5728\u6377\u514b\u548c\u65af\u6d1b\u4f10\u514b\u65b0\u95fb\u8bc4\u8bba\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u5730\u65b9\u8bed\u5883\u53ca\u8bed\u8a00\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u5f02\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u53d1\u5c55\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u58f0\u660e\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u548c\u53bb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5316\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u6863\u7ea7\u58f0\u660e\u63d0\u53d6\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u9886\u57df\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u63d0\u53d6\u58f0\u660e\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u624b\u6bb5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6216\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u5883\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u58f0\u660e\u96c6\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u4f73\u58f0\u660e\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u58f0\u660e\u96c6\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6377\u514b\u548c\u65af\u6d1b\u4f10\u514b\u65b0\u95fb\u8bc4\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u58f0\u660e\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6355\u6349\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u53ca\u5224\u65ad\u58f0\u660e\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u3001\u53bb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5316\u7b49\u5c5e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6587\u6863\u7ea7\u58f0\u660e\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u53d1\u5c55\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u58f0\u660e\u6838\u5fc3\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u6807\u6ce8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Instead of training detectors tailored to specific datasets, we study a training-free approach leveraging self-supervised models without requiring prior data knowledge. These models, pre-trained with augmentations like RandomResizedCrop, learn to produce consistent representations across varying resolutions. Motivated by this, we propose WaRPAD, a training-free AI-generated image detection algorithm based on self-supervised models. Since neighborhood pixel differences in images are highly sensitive to resizing operations, WaRPAD first defines a base score function that quantifies the sensitivity of image embeddings to perturbations along high-frequency directions extracted via Haar wavelet decomposition. To simulate robustness against cropping augmentation, we rescale each image to a multiple of the models input size, divide it into smaller patches, and compute the base score for each patch. The final detection score is then obtained by averaging the scores across all patches. We validate WaRPAD on real datasets of diverse resolutions and domains, and images generated by 23 different generative models. Our method consistently achieves competitive performance and demonstrates strong robustness to test-time corruptions. Furthermore, as invariance to RandomResizedCrop is a common training scheme across self-supervised models, we show that WaRPAD is applicable across self-supervised models.", "AI": {"tldr": "WaRPAD\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Haar\u5c0f\u6ce2\u5206\u89e3\u63d0\u53d6\u9ad8\u9891\u65b9\u5411\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u6270\u52a8\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u5757\u5e73\u5747\u5f97\u5206\u5b9e\u73b0\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5bf9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u566a\u58f0\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u7c7b\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0cAI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u968f\u673a\u7f29\u653e\u7b49\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u8868\u793a\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u901a\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "WaRPAD\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7Haar\u5c0f\u6ce2\u5206\u89e3\u63d0\u53d6\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u57fa\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u7f29\u653e\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u5165\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7684\u500d\u6570\uff0c\u5206\u5272\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u5c0f\u5757\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u5757\u7684\u57fa\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b\u6700\u7ec8\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u5757\u7684\u5f97\u5206\u53d6\u5e73\u5747\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u68c0\u6d4b\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "WaRPAD\u572823\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u53ca\u591a\u9886\u57df\u3001\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u63a5\u8fd1\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7684\u5404\u7c7b\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u53d8\u6362\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u666e\u904d\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u914d\u4e8e\u5404\u7c7b\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "WaRPAD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3-free AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u968f\u673a\u7f29\u653e\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Our approach proceeds in two stages. First, we introduce a semantically aware labeling algorithm that, given a generated SQL and a gold reference, assigns node-level correctness without over-penalizing structural containers or alias variation. Second, we represent each node with a rich set of schema-aware and lexical features - capturing identifier validity, alias resolution, type compatibility, ambiguity in scope, and typo signals - and train a supervised classifier to predict per-node error probabilities. We interpret these probabilities as calibrated uncertainty, enabling fine-grained diagnostics that pinpoint exactly where a query is likely to be wrong. Across multiple databases and datasets, our method substantially outperforms token log-probabilities: average AUC improves by +27.44% while maintaining robustness under cross-database evaluation.

The key challenges of the task lie in two aspects: (1) faithfully preserving the garment details, and (2) gaining fine-grained controllability over the model's appearance. Existing methods typically require performing garment deformation in the generation process, which often leads to garment texture distortions. Also, they fail to control the fine-grained attributes of the generated models, due to the lack of specifically designed mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose FashionMAC, a novel diffusion-based deformation-free framework that achieves high-quality and controllable fashion showcase image generation. The core idea of our framework is to eliminate the need for performing garment deformation and directly outpaint the garment segmented from a dressed person, which enables faithful preservation of the intricate garment details. Moreover, we propose a novel region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) mechanism along with a chained mask injection strategy to achieve fine-grained appearance controllability over the synthesized human models. Specifically, RADA adaptively predicts the generated regions for each fine-grained text attribute and enforces the text attribute to focus on the predicted regions by a chained mask injection strategy, significantly enhancing the visual fidelity and the controllability. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our framework compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "FashionMAC is a diffusion-based, deformation-free framework for garment-centric fashion image generation that preserves detailed garment textures and enables fine-grained controllability through a region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) mechanism and chained mask injection strategy.", "motivation": "Existing methods struggle with garment texture distortions due to required deformation during generation and lack fine-grained control over human model appearance, limiting realism and controllability in fashion image synthesis.", "method": "FashionMAC eliminates garment deformation by directly outpainting segmented garments from dressed persons.

We used electronic health record (EHR) data to dynamically track AKI patients' clinical evolution and characterize AKI-to-CKD progression. Post-AKI clinical states were identified by clustering patient vectors derived from longitudinal medical codes and creatinine measurements. Transition probabilities between states and progression to CKD were estimated using multi-state modeling. After identifying common post-AKI trajectories, CKD risk factors in AKI subpopulations were identified through survival analysis. Of 20,699 patients with AKI at admission, 3,491 (17%) developed CKD. We identified fifteen distinct post-AKI states, each with different probabilities of CKD development.

Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic models generate high-resolution flood maps using numerical methods requiring fine-grid discretization; which are computationally intensive and impractical for real-time large-scale applications. While recent studies have applied convolutional neural networks for flood map super-resolution with good accuracy and speed, they suffer from limited generalizability to unseen areas. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models to perform super-resolution on coarse-grid flood maps, with the objective of achieving the accuracy of fine-grid flood maps while significantly reducing inference time. Experimental results demonstrate that latent diffusion models substantially decrease the computational time required to produce high-fidelity flood maps without compromising on accuracy, enabling their use in real-time flood risk management. Moreover, diffusion models exhibit superior generalizability across different physical locations, with transfer learning further accelerating adaptation to new geographic regions. Our approach also incorporates physics-informed inputs, addressing the common limitation of black-box behavior in machine learning, thereby enhancing interpretability.

Although recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have enabled automatic bias classification, the extent to which large language models (LLMs) align with human judgment still remains relatively underexplored and not yet well understood. This study aims to present a comparative framework for evaluating the detection of political bias across human annotations and multiple LLMs, including GPT, BERT, RoBERTa, and FLAN. We construct a manually annotated dataset of news articles and assess annotation consistency, bias polarity, and inter-model agreement to quantify divergence between human and model perceptions of bias. Experimental results show that among traditional transformer-based models, RoBERTa achieves the highest alignment with human labels, whereas generative models such as GPT demonstrate the strongest overall agreement with human annotations in a zero-shot setting. Among all transformer-based baselines, our fine-tuned RoBERTa model acquired the highest accuracy and the strongest alignment with human-annotated labels. Our findings highlight systematic differences in how humans and LLMs perceive political slant, underscoring the need for hybrid evaluation frameworks that combine human interpretability with model scalability in automated media bias detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u6587\u7ae0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08GPT\u3001BERT\u3001RoBERTa\u3001FLAN\uff09\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u504f\u89c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4f20\u7edfTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e2dRoBERTa\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u6700\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6a21\u578bGPT\u6574\u4f53\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u543b\u5408\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\u3002\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684RoBERTa\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u653f\u6cbb\u503e\u5411\u4e0a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u504f\u89c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u4e00\u81f4\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u6587\u7ae0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u6ce8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u504f\u89c1\u6781\u6027\u53ca\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u591a\u4e2aLLM\uff08GPT\u3001BERT\u3001RoBERTa\u3001FLAN\uff09\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "RoBERTa\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u6700\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6a21\u578bGPT\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6574\u4f53\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6700\u5f3a\uff1b\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684RoBERTa\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u504f\u89c1\u611f\u77e5\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u53d1\u5c55\u878d\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5a92\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a new method to automatically detect, localize and classify defects in concrete bridge structures using drone imagery. This framework is constituted of two main stages. The first stage uses saliency for defect region proposals where defects often exhibit local discontinuities in the normal surface patterns with regard to their surrounding. The second stage employs a YOLOX-based deep learning detector that operates on saliency-enhanced images obtained by applying bounding-box level brightness augmentation to salient defect regions. Experimental results on standard datasets confirm the performance of our framework and its suitability in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, which give a huge potential to be implemented in a self-powered inspection system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\u6865\u6881\u7ed3\u6784\u7f3a\u9677\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u5229\u7528\u663e\u8457\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u7f3a\u9677\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u56e0\u7f3a\u9677\u5e38\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u5c40\u90e8\u8868\u9762\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eYOLOX\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u7ea7\u4eae\u5ea6\u589e\u5f3a\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5728\u81ea\u4f9b\u7535\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7f3a\u9677\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u3001\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u6865\u6881\u8868\u9762\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u7f3a\u9677\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ecd\u662f\u6311\u6218\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u7a0b\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u663e\u8457\u6027\u5206\u6790\u751f\u6210\u7f3a\u9677\u533a\u57df\u5019\u9009\u6846\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u5c40\u90e8\u8868\u9762\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u5bf9\u5019\u9009\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u7ea7\u4eae\u5ea6\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f3a\u5316\u7f3a\u9677\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u91c7\u7528YOLOX\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u540e\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7f3a\u9677\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u591a\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8e\u81ea\u4f9b\u7535\u667a\u80fd\u5de1\u68c0\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u663e\u8457\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u589e\u5f3a\u578bYOLOX\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\u6865\u6881\u7f3a\u9677\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Breaking Certified Defences with Ghost Certificates", "comment": "Published as a conference paper at the Fortieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-26). Code available at: https://github.com/ghostcert/ghostcert", "summary": "Certified defenses promise provable robustness guarantees. We study the malicious exploitation of probabilistic certification frameworks to better understand the limits of guarantee provisions. Now, the objective is to not only mislead a classifier, but also manipulate the certification process to generate a robustness guarantee for an adversarial input certificate spoofing. A recent study in ICLR demonstrated that crafting large perturbations can shift inputs far into regions capable of generating a certificate for an incorrect class. Our study investigates if perturbations needed to cause a misclassification and yet coax a certified model into issuing a deceptive, large robustness radius for a target class can still be made small and imperceptible. We explore the idea of region-focused adversarial examples to craft imperceptible perturbations, spoof certificates and achieve certification radii larger than the source class ghost certificates. Extensive evaluations with the ImageNet demonstrate the ability to effectively bypass state-of-the-art certified defenses such as Densepure.

However, extending AR models to general image editing remains challenging due to weak and inefficient conditioning, often leading to poor instruction adherence and visual artifacts. To address this, we propose SCAR, a Semantic-Context-driven method for Autoregressive models. SCAR introduces two key components: Compressed Semantic Prefilling, which encodes high-level semantics into a compact and efficient prefix, and Semantic Alignment Guidance, which aligns the last visual hidden states with target semantics during autoregressive decoding to enhance instruction fidelity. Unlike decoding-stage injection methods, SCAR builds upon the flexibility and generality of vector-quantized-based prefilling while overcoming its semantic limitations and high cost.

Augmented retrieval yields the largest gains when narratives pair with prioritized variants by resolving ambiguity and aligning candidates to mechanisms.

Existing token compression methods, while varied, often lack a high-level semantic understanding, leading to suboptimal merges, information redundancy, or context loss. To address these limitations, we introduce CORE (Compact Object-centric REpresentations), a new paradigm for visual token compression. CORE leverages an efficient segmentation decoder to generate object masks, which serve as a high-level semantic prior to guide the merging of visual tokens into a compact set of object-centric representations. Furthermore, a novel centroid-guided sorting mechanism restores a coherent spatial order to the merged tokens, preserving vital positional information. Extensive experiments show that CORE not only establishes a new state-of-the-art on six authoritative benchmarks for fixed-rate compression, but also achieves dramatic efficiency gains in adaptive-rate settings. Even under extreme compression, after aggressively retaining with only 2.2% of all visual tokens, CORE still maintains 97.4% of baseline performance.

In one such case--the comparative illusion (CI), e.g., More students have been to Russia than I have--comprehenders tend to judge the sentence as acceptable despite its underlying nonsensical comparison. Prior research has argued that this phenomenon can be explained as Bayesian inference over a noisy channel: the posterior probability of an interpretation of a sentence is proportional to both the prior probability of that interpretation and the likelihood of corruption into the observed (CI) sentence. Initial behavioral work has supported this claim by evaluating a narrow set of alternative interpretations of CI sentences and showing that comprehenders favor interpretations that are more likely to have been corrupted into the illusory sentence. In this study, we replicate and go substantially beyond this earlier work by directly predicting the strength of illusion with a quantitative model of the posterior probability of plausible interpretations, which we derive through a novel synthesis of statistical language models with human behavioral data. Our model explains not only the fine gradations in the strength of CI effects, but also a previously unexplained effect caused by pronominal vs. full noun phrase than-clause subjects. These findings support a noisy-channel theory of sentence comprehension by demonstrating that the theory makes novel predictions about the comparative illusion that bear out empirically. This outcome joins related evidence of noisy channel processing in both illusory and non-illusory contexts to support noisy channel inference as a unified computational-level theory of diverse language processing phenomena.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9a\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u6bd4\u8f83\u9519\u89c9\uff08CI\uff09\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86CI\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8fd8\u9996\u6b21\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4ee3\u8bcd\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u540d\u8bcd\u77ed\u8bed\u4f5c\u4ece\u53e5\u4e3b\u8bed\u65f6\u7684\u672a\u89e3\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u53e5\u5b50\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u901a\u9053\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5c42\u7ea7\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6bd4\u8f83\u9519\u89c9\uff08CI\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u566a\u58f0\u901a\u9053\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u6b64\u7c7b\u73b0\u8c61\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u540e\u9a8c\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u6bd4\u8f83\u9519\u89c9\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u9519\u89c9\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5148\u524d\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4ee3\u8bcd\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u540d\u8bcd\u77ed\u8bed\u4e3b\u8bed\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u901a\u9053\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u566a\u58f0\u901a\u9053\u7406\u8bba\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u91ca\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9519\u89c9\u548c\u975e\u9519\u89c9\u60c5\u5883\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8ba1\u7b97\u5c42\u7ea7\u7406\u8bba\u3002"}}

This dependency on \"big data\" is a critical bottleneck in the medical domain, where patient data is inherently difficult to acquire and expert annotation is expensive, particularly for rare diseases where samples are scarce by definition. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel paradigm: Zero-Training Task-Specific Model Synthesis (ZS-TMS). Instead of adapting a pre-existing model or training a new one, our approach leverages a large-scale, pre-trained generative engine to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier. Our framework, the Semantic-Guided Parameter Synthesizer (SGPS), takes as input minimal, multi-modal task information as little as a single example image (1-shot) and a corresponding clinical text description to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier.\n  The generative engine interprets these inputs to generate the weights for a lightweight, efficient classifier (e.g., an EfficientNet-V2), which can be deployed for inference immediately without any task-specific training or fine-tuning. We conduct extensive evaluations on challenging few-shot classification benchmarks derived from the ISIC 2018 skin lesion dataset and a custom rare disease dataset. Our results demonstrate that SGPS establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming advanced few-shot and zero-shot learning methods, especially in the ultra-low data regimes of 1-shot and 5-shot classification.

Exponential maps preserve geodesics but have stiff, radius-dependent Jacobians, while volume-preserving charts maintain densities but distort geodesic distances. Both approaches entangle curvature with model parameters, inflating gradient variance. In high-dimensional latent normalizing flows, the wrapped exponential prior can stretch radii far beyond the curvature scale, leading to poor test likelihoods and stiff solvers. We introduce Radial Compensation (RC), an information-geometric method that selects the base density in the tangent space so that the likelihood depends only on geodesic distance from a pole, decoupling parameter semantics from curvature. RC lets radial parameters retain their usual meaning in geodesic units, while the chart can be tuned as a numerical preconditioner. We extend RC to manifolds with known geodesic polar volume and show that RC is the only construction for geodesic-radial likelihoods with curvature-invariant Fisher information. We derive the Balanced-Exponential (bExp) chart family, balancing volume distortion and geodesic error. Under RC, all bExp settings preserve the same manifold density and Fisher information, with smaller dial values reducing gradient variance and flow cost. Empirically, RC yields stable generative models across densities, VAEs, flows on images and graphs, and protein models. RC improves likelihoods, restores clean geodesic radii, and prevents radius blow-ups in high-dimensional flows, making RC-bExp a robust default for likelihood-trained generative models on manifolds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRadial Compensation\uff08RC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u66f2\u9762\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u56e0\u66f2\u7387\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u7ea0\u7f20\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002RC\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u5207\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u4f3c\u7136\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6d4b\u5730\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f2\u7387\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u89e3\u8026\u3002\u5f15\u5165Balanced-Exponential\uff08bExp\uff09\u56fe\u8868\u65cf\uff0c\u5728\u4f53\u79ef\u5931\u771f\u4e0e\u6d4b\u5730\u8bef\u5dee\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u6240\u6709bExp\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u540c\u6d41\u5f62\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u8d39\u96ea\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5c0f\u62e8\u53f7\u503c\u964d\u4f4e\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0e\u6d41\u6210\u672c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eRC\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u56fe\u3001\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u4f3c\u7136\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u9632\u6b62\u534a\u5f84\u7206\u70b8\uff0c\u662f\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u4f3c\u7136\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u9ed8\u8ba4\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u66f2\u9762\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fe\u8868\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u4f46\u6307\u6570\u6620\u5c04\u5b58\u5728\u534a\u5f84\u76f8\u5173\u521a\u6027\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\uff0c\u4fdd\u4f53\u79ef\u56fe\u8868\u5219\u626d\u66f2\u6d4b\u5730\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u5747\u5c06\u66f2\u7387\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u5927\u3001\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6d41\u4e2d\u534a\u5f84\u81a8\u80c0\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4f3c\u7136\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5Radial Compensation\uff08RC\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5207\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u4f3c\u7136\u51fd\u6570\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4ece\u6781\u70b9\u51fa\u53d1\u7684\u6d4b\u5730\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u8026\u53c2\u6570\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u66f2\u7387\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6784\u5efaBalanced-Exponential\uff08bExp\uff09\u56fe\u8868\u65cf\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4f53\u79ef\u7578\u53d8\u4e0e\u6d4b\u5730\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u552f\u4e00\u6ee1\u8db3\u66f2\u7387\u4e0d\u53d8\u8d39\u96ea\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6784\u9020\u3002", "result": "RC-bExp\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u56fe\u3001\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7b49\u591a\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f3c\u7136\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u6d4b\u5730\u534a\u5f84\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u534a\u5f84\u7206\u70b8\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8d39\u96ea\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5c0f\u53c2\u6570\u503c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "Radial Compensation\u7ed3\u5408bExp\u56fe\u8868\u662f\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u4f3c\u7136\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u9ed8\u8ba4\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u66f2\u7387\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u3002"}}

Traditional motion analysis systems are often expensive and intrusive, limiting their use in natural training environments. To address this limitation, we propose a machine learning-based multimodal framework that integrates wearable sensor data for simultaneous action recognition and stress estimation. Using a self-developed wrist-worn device equipped with an accelerometer and photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, we collected synchronized motion and physiological data during real archery sessions. For motion recognition, we introduce a novel feature--Smoothed Differential Acceleration (SmoothDiff)--and employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to identify motion phases, achieving 96.8% accuracy and 95.9% F1-score. For stress estimation, we extract heart rate variability (HRV) features from PPG signals and apply a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, achieving 80% accuracy in distinguishing high- and low-stress levels. The proposed framework demonstrates that integrating motion and physiological sensing can provide meaningful insights into athletes' technical and mental states.

This limitation stems in part from training data that focuses on language reasoning rather than spatial understanding due to scarce 3D resources, leaving inherent grounding biases unresolved. To address this, we propose 3D scene editing as a key mechanism to generate precise visual counterfactuals that mitigate these biases through fine-grained spatial manipulation, without requiring costly scene reconstruction or large-scale 3D data collection. Furthermore, to make these edits targeted and directly address the specific weaknesses of the model, we introduce DEER-3D, an error-driven framework following a structured \"Decompose, Diagnostic Evaluation, Edit, and Re-train\" workflow, rather than broadly or randomly augmenting data as in conventional approaches. Specifically, upon identifying a grounding failure of the 3D-LLM, our framework first diagnoses the exact predicate-level error (e.g., attribute or spatial relation). It then executes minimal, predicate-aligned 3D scene edits, such as recoloring or repositioning, to produce targeted counterfactual supervision for iterative model fine-tuning, significantly enhancing grounding accuracy. We evaluate our editing pipeline across multiple benchmarks for 3D grounding and scene understanding tasks, consistently demonstrating improvements across all evaluated datasets through iterative refinement. DEER-3D underscores the effectiveness of targeted, error-driven scene editing in bridging linguistic reasoning capabilities with spatial grounding in 3D LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDEER-3D\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bef\u5dee\u9a71\u52a8\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u7f16\u8f91\u6765\u63d0\u53473D-LLM\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u2018\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u7f16\u8f91\u3001\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u2019\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0a\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u9519\u8bef\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u5982\u91cd\u7f6e\u989c\u8272\u6216\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00-\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a3D\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d3D-LLM\u5728\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e3D\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5143\u7d20\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u504f\u91cd\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u800c\u975e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf3D\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u504f\u5dee\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDEER-3D\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u2018\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u7f16\u8f91\u3001\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u2019\u56db\u6b65\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u8bc6\u522b3D-LLM\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5931\u8d25\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\u5728\u8c13\u8bcd\u5c42\u9762\uff08\u5982\u5c5e\u6027\u6216\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\u8bca\u65ad\u9519\u8bef\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u6267\u884c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u8c13\u8bcd\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u7f16\u8f91\uff08\u5982\u91cd\u8272\u3001\u79fb\u4f4d\uff09\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u76d1\u7763\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u7528\u4e8e\u8fed\u4ee3\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a3D\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDEER-3D\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8bef\u5dee\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u573a\u666f\u7f16\u8f91\u5728\u589e\u5f3a3D-LLM\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a5\u5730\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DEER-3D\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u51c6\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u9519\u8bef\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u54083D-LLM\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While existing approaches have made significant progress in learning medication representations, they suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) treating medical entities as independent features without modeling their synergistic effects on medication selection; (ii) employing static causal relationships that fail to adapt to patient-specific contexts and health states. To address these challenges, we propose CafeMed, a framework that integrates dynamic causal reasoning with cross-modal attention for safe and accurate medication recommendation. CafeMed introduces two key components: the Causal Weight Generator (CWG) that transforms static causal effects into dynamic modulation weights based on individual patient states, and the Channel Harmonized Attention Refinement Module (CHARM) that captures complex interdependencies between diagnoses and procedures. This design enables CafeMed to model how different medical conditions jointly influence treatment decisions while maintaining medication safety constraints. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that CafeMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior accuracy in medication prediction while maintaining the lower drug--drug interaction rates. Our results indicate that incorporating dynamic causal relationships and cross-modal synergies leads to more clinically-aligned and personalized medication recommendations.

During training, CFG stochastically alternates between conditional and null prompts to enable both conditional and unconditional generation. However, during sampling, CFG outputs both null and conditional prompts simultaneously, leading to inconsistent noise estimates between the training and sampling processes. To reduce this error, we propose CFG-EC, a versatile correction scheme augmentable to any CFG-based method by refining the unconditional noise predictions. CFG-EC actively realigns the unconditional noise error component to be orthogonal to the conditional error component. This corrective maneuver prevents interference between the two guidance components, thereby constraining the sampling error's upper bound and establishing more reliable guidance trajectories for high-fidelity image generation.

The existing LTR methods based on cross-entropy (CE) loss not only struggle to learn features with desirable properties but also couple imbalanced classifier vectors in the denominator of its Softmax, amplifying the imbalance effects in LTR. In this paper, for the LTR, we propose a binary cross-entropy (BCE)-based tripartite synergistic learning, termed BCE3S, which consists of three components: (1) BCE-based joint learning optimizes both the classifier and sample features, which achieves better compactness and separability among features than the CE-based joint learning, by decoupling the metrics between feature and the imbalanced classifier vectors in multiple Sigmoid; (2) BCE-based contrastive learning further improves the intra-class compactness of features; (3) BCE-based uniform learning balances the separability among classifier vectors and interactively enhances the feature properties by combining with the joint learning. The extensive experiments show that the LTR model trained by BCE3S not only achieves higher compactness and separability among sample features, but also balances the classifier's separability, achieving SOTA performance on various long-tailed datasets such as CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u5143\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\uff08BCE\uff09\u7684\u4e09\u91cd\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08BCE3S\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u957f\u5c3e\u8bc6\u522b\uff08LTR\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5411\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7c7b\u5185\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u548c\u7c7b\u95f4\u53ef\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u957f\u5c3e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\uff08CE\uff09\u635f\u5931\u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5728Softmax\u7684\u5206\u6bcd\u4e2d\u8026\u5408\u4e86\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u957f\u5c3e\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u89e3\u8026\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3001\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "BCE3S\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a(1) \u57fa\u4e8eBCE\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2aSigmoid\u89e3\u8026\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u6837\u672c\u7279\u5f81\uff1b(2) \u57fa\u4e8eBCE\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u589e\u5f3a\u7c7b\u5185\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\uff1b(3) \u57fa\u4e8eBCE\u7684\u5747\u5300\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBCE3S\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u4e5f\u5f97\u5230\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u5c3e\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728CIFAR10-LT\u3001CIFAR100-LT\u3001ImageNet-LT\u548ciNaturalist2018\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\uff08SOTA\uff09\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "BCE3S\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u91cd\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u957f\u5c3e\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u5c3e\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing auditing methods, however, pose a significant challenge for large-scale systems since they require modifying the training dataset -- for instance, by injecting out-of-distribution canaries or removing samples from training. Such interventions on the training data pipeline are resource-intensive and involve considerable engineering overhead. We introduce a novel observational auditing framework that leverages the inherent randomness of data distributions, enabling privacy evaluation without altering the original dataset.

However, existing methods often rely on task-specific designs or latent routing strategies, making it hard to adapt to real-world scenarios with various degradations. We propose FAPE-IR, a Frequency-Aware Planning and Execution framework for image restoration. It uses a frozen Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a planner to analyze degraded images and generate concise, frequency-aware restoration plans. These plans guide a LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (LoRA-MoE) module within a diffusion-based executor, which dynamically selects high- or low-frequency experts, complemented by frequency features of the input image. To further improve restoration quality and reduce artifacts, we introduce adversarial training and a frequency regularization loss. By coupling semantic planning with frequency-based restoration, FAPE-IR offers a unified and interpretable solution for all-in-one image restoration.

While offloading experts to host memory is a common solution, it introduces a severe I/O bottleneck over the PCIe bus, as the data-dependent nature of expert selection places these synchronous transfers directly on the critical path of execution, crippling performance.\n  This paper argues that the I/O bottleneck can be overcome by trading a small amount of cheap, on-device computation to hide the immense cost of data movement. We present MoE-SpeQ, a new inference system built on a novel co-design of speculative execution and expert offloading. MoE-SpeQ employs a small, on-device draft model to predict the sequence of required experts for future tokens. This foresight enables a runtime orchestrator to prefetch these experts from host memory, effectively overlapping the expensive I/O with useful computation and hiding the latency from the critical path. To maximize performance, an adaptive governor, guided by an Amortization Roofline Model, dynamically tunes the speculation strategy to the underlying hardware. Our evaluation on memory-constrained devices shows that for the Phi-MoE model, MoE-SpeQ achieves at most 2.34x speedup over the state-of-the-art offloading framework. Our work establishes a new, principled approach for managing data-dependent memory access in resource-limited environments, making MoE inference more accessible on commodity hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoE-SpeQ\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u6d4b\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u5378\u8f7d\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u578b\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u8349\u7a3f\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u4ee4\u724c\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u63d0\u524d\u4ece\u4e3b\u673a\u5185\u5b58\u9884\u53d6\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9690\u85cf\u6570\u636e\u79fb\u52a8\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MoE\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5c06\u4e13\u5bb6\u5378\u8f7d\u5230\u4e3b\u673a\u5185\u5b58\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u4e25\u91cd\u7684PCIe I/O\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e14\u7531\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u6b65\u4f20\u8f93\u76f4\u63a5\u4f4d\u4e8e\u6267\u884c\u5173\u952e\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5c0f\u578b\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u8349\u7a3f\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u4ee4\u724c\u6240\u9700\u4e13\u5bb6\uff1b\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u534f\u8c03\u5668\u636e\u6b64\u9884\u53d6\u4e13\u5bb6\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6298\u65e7\u5c4b\u9876\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u8282\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u9002\u914d\u786c\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5bf9Phi-MoE\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cMoE-SpeQ\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5378\u8f7d\u6846\u67b6\u6700\u9ad8\u5b9e\u73b02.34\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ba1\u7406\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u65b0\u539f\u5219\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7fMoE\u63a8\u7406\u66f4\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u3002"}}

While existing methods can modify video content if explicit descriptions of editing targets with precise spatial locations and temporal boundaries are provided, these requirements become impractical when users attempt to conceptualize edits through implicit queries referencing semantic properties or object relationships. We introduce reasoning video editing, a task where video editing models must interpret implicit queries through multi-hop reasoning to infer editing targets before executing modifications, and a first model attempting to solve this complex task, RIVER (Reasoning-based Implicit Video Editor). RIVER decouples reasoning from generation through digital twin representations of video content that preserve spatial relationships, temporal trajectories, and semantic attributes. A large language model then processes this representation jointly with the implicit query, performing multi-hop reasoning to determine modifications, then outputs structured instructions that guide a diffusion-based editor to execute pixel-level changes. RIVER training uses reinforcement learning with rewards that evaluate reasoning accuracy and generation quality. Finally, we introduce RVEBenchmark, a benchmark of 100 videos with 519 implicit queries spanning three levels and categories of reasoning complexity specifically for reasoning video editing. RIVER demonstrates best performance on the proposed RVEBenchmark and also achieves state-of-the-art performance on two additional video editing benchmarks (VegGIE and FiVE), where it surpasses six baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRIVER\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u8981\u6c42\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u7406\u89e3\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u52a8\u63a8\u65ad\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002RIVER\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u8868\u793a\u6765\u4fdd\u7559\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6307\u4ee4\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b8c\u6210\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4fee\u6539\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u540c\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6RVEBenchmark\uff0c\u5305\u542b100\u6bb5\u89c6\u9891\u548c519\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u67e5\u8be2\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRIVER\u5728RVEBenchmark\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5e76\u5728VegGIE\u548cFiVE\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u516d\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5bf9\u7f16\u8f91\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u660e\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\uff08\u5982\u7cbe\u786e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5c5e\u6027\u6216\u5bf9\u8c61\u5173\u7cfb\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u8981\u6c42\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u7406\u89e3\u62bd\u8c61\u3001\u95f4\u63a5\u6587\u672c\u6307\u4ee4\u5e76\u81ea\u4e3b\u63a8\u65ad\u7f16\u8f91\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "RIVER\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4fdd\u7559\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8054\u5408\u5904\u7406\u8be5\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u9690\u5f0f\u6587\u672c\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u4fee\u6539\u5185\u5bb9\uff1b\u8f93\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u7531\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6267\u884c\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u7f16\u8f91\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "RIVER\u5728\u81ea\u5efa\u7684RVEBenchmark\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5728VegGIE\u548cFiVE\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "RIVER\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u9690\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u8868\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u7cbe\u51c6\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u667a\u80fd\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Standard practice collapses these label distributions into single labels, aggregating diverse human judgments into point estimates. We argue that this approach is epistemically misaligned for ambiguous data--the annotation distribution itself should be regarded as the ground truth. Training on collapsed single labels forces models to express false confidence on fundamentally ambiguous cases, creating a misalignment between model certainty and the diversity of human perception. We demonstrate empirically that soft-label training, which treats annotation distributions as ground truth, preserves epistemic uncertainty. Across both vision and NLP tasks, soft-label training achieves 32% lower KL divergence from human annotations and 61% stronger correlation between model and annotation entropy, while matching the accuracy of hard-label training. Our work repositions annotation distributions from noisy signals to be aggregated away, to faithful representations of epistemic uncertainty that models should learn to reproduce.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6807\u6ce8\u5206\u5e03\u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u5408\u5e76\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u6807\u7b7e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u6807\u7b7e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u7559\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u7684KL\u6563\u5ea6\uff0832%\uff09\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6807\u6ce8\u71b5\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0861%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u786c\u6807\u7b7e\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u505a\u6cd5\u5c06\u591a\u6837\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u5408\u5e76\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u865a\u5047\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8f6f\u6807\u7b7e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5c06\u6807\u6ce8\u5206\u5e03\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5efa\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u548cNLP\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u8f6f\u6807\u7b7e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u7684KL\u6563\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e32%\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6807\u6ce8\u71b5\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u63d0\u534761%\uff0c\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u786c\u6807\u7b7e\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6807\u6ce8\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5e94\u88ab\u5f53\u4f5c\u9700\u8981\u805a\u5408\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u800c\u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u53cd\u6620\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u5b66\u4f1a\u91cd\u73b0\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

The simplicity and flexibility of self-supervised monocular depth estimation are conducive to its role in these fields. However, most existing monocular depth estimation models consume many computing resources. Although some methods have reduced the model's size and improved computing efficiency, the performance deteriorates, seriously hindering the real-world deployment of self-supervised monocular depth estimation models in the real world. To address this problem, we proposed a real-time self-supervised monocular depth estimation method and implemented it in the real world. It is called RTS-Mono, which is a lightweight and efficient encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder is based on Lite-Encoder, and the decoder is designed with a multi-scale sparse fusion framework to minimize redundancy, ensure performance, and improve inference speed. RTS-Mono achieved state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance in high and low resolutions with extremely low parameter counts (3 M) in experiments based on the KITTI dataset.

The need for answering such \"when-if\" questions--how the timing of an event would change under a specified intervention--commonly arises in real-world settings with heterogeneous treatment adoption and confounding. To address these challenges, we propose Synthetic Survival Control (SSC) to estimate counterfactual hazard trajectories in a panel data setting where multiple units experience potentially different treatments over multiple periods. In such a setting, SSC estimates the counterfactual hazard trajectory for a unit of interest as a weighted combination of the observed trajectories from other units. To provide formal justification, we introduce a panel framework with a low-rank structure for causal survival analysis. Indeed, such a structure naturally arises under classical parametric survival models. Within this framework, for the causal estimand of interest, we establish identification and finite sample guarantees for SSC. We validate our approach using a multi-country clinical dataset of cancer treatment outcomes, where the staggered introduction of new therapies creates a quasi-experimental setting. Empirically, we find that access to novel treatments is associated with improved survival, as reflected by lower post-intervention hazard trajectories relative to their synthetic counterparts. Given the broad relevance of survival analysis across medicine, economics, and public policy, our framework offers a general and interpretable tool for counterfactual survival inference using observational data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSynthetic Survival Control (SSC)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u56e0\u679c\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u98ce\u9669\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5220\u5931\u3001\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u5c0f\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u5206\u914d\u975e\u968f\u673a\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u548c\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u56fd\u764c\u75c7\u6cbb\u7597\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u7597\u6cd5\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u7387\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u5b58\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e38\u9700\u56de\u7b54\u2018\u5982\u679c\u67d0\u5e72\u9884\u4f55\u65f6\u53d1\u751f\u2019\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u5220\u5931\u3001\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u5c0f\u53ca\u975e\u968f\u673a\u6cbb\u7597\u5206\u914d\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSSC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u5355\u4f4d\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u98ce\u9669\u8f68\u8ff9\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5176\u4ed6\u5355\u4f4d\u89c2\u6d4b\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9762\u677f\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u56fd\u764c\u75c7\u6cbb\u7597\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u65b0\u7597\u6cd5\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u4e0e\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8f68\u8ff9\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u751f\u5b58\u7387\uff1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u5907\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "SSC\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c2\u5bdf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u751f\u5b58\u63a8\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u516c\u5171\u653f\u7b56\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

State-of-the-art methods aggregate features from deep backbones to form global descriptors. Optimal transport-based aggregation methods reformulate feature-to-cluster assignment as a transport problem, but the standard Sinkhorn algorithm symmetrically treats source and target marginals, limiting effectiveness when image features and cluster centers exhibit substantially different distributions. We propose an asymmetric aggregation VPR method with geometric constraints for locally aggregated descriptors, called $A^2$GC-VPR. Our method employs row-column normalization averaging with separate marginal calibration, enabling asymmetric matching that adapts to distributional discrepancies in visual place recognition. Geometric constraints are incorporated through learnable coordinate embeddings, computing compatibility scores fused with feature similarities, thereby promoting spatially proximal features to the same cluster and enhancing spatial awareness.

Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches steer fairness by shaping reward through post hoc orchestrations, leaving no certifiable self-enforceable fairness that is immutable by individual agents at runtime. Contextualized within a setting where each agent shares resources with others, we address this shortcoming with a learning enabled optimization scheme among self-interested decision makers whose individual actions affect those of other agents. This extends the problem to a generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) game-theoretic framework where we steer group policy to a safe and locally efficient equilibrium, so that no agent can improve its utility function by unilaterally changing its decisions. Fair-GNE models MARL as a constrained generalized Nash equilibrium-seeking (GNE) game, prescribing an ideal equitable collective equilibrium within the problem's natural fabric.

Identifying and mitigating biases in LLMs is crucial to ensure fair outputs, as they can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misinformation. This study highlights the need to address biases in LLMs amid growing generative AI. We studied bias-specific benchmarks such as StereoSet and CrowSPairs to evaluate the existence of various biases in multiple generative models such as BERT and GPT 3.5. We proposed an automated Bias-Identification Framework to recognize various social biases in LLMs such as gender, race, profession, and religion. We adopted a two-pronged approach to detect explicit and implicit biases in text data. Results indicated fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but excelled at identifying and avoiding racial biases. Our findings illustrated that despite having some success, LLMs often over-relied on keywords. To illuminate the capability of the analyzed LLMs in detecting implicit biases, we employed Bag-of-Words analysis and unveiled indications of implicit stereotyping within the vocabulary. To bolster the model performance, we applied an enhancement strategy involving fine-tuning models using prompting techniques and data augmentation of the bias benchmarks. The fine-tuned models exhibited promising adaptability during cross-dataset testing and significantly enhanced performance on implicit bias benchmarks, with performance gains of up to 20%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u663e\u6027\u548c\u9690\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u504f\u89c1\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7StereoSet\u548cCrowSPairs\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86BERT\u548cGPT 3.5\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u7ba1\u9f50\u4e0b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u663e\u6027\u548c\u9690\u6027\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u79cd\u65cf\u504f\u89c1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u4e14\u666e\u904d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bcd\u888b\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bcd\u6c47\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u9690\u6027\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u9690\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe20%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7ee7\u627f\u4e86\u663e\u6027\u548c\u9690\u6027\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u52a0\u5267\u793e\u4f1a\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u89c1\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u8f93\u51fa\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002\u968f\u7740\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u5c24\u4e3a\u8feb\u5207\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u663e\u6027\u4e0e\u9690\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5229\u7528StereoSet\u548cCrowSPairs\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u504f\u89c1\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u5e94\u7528\u8bcd\u888b\u5206\u6790\u63a2\u7d22\u9690\u6027\u504f\u89c1\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9690\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534720%\uff1b\u4f46\u5bf9\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u504f\u89c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u5e94\u5bf9\u4ecd\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\uff0c\u4e14\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9690\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, controllable fine-tuning that prevents models from learning undesired concepts present in the fine-tuning data, and from entangling those concepts with user prompts, remains an open challenge. It is crucial for downstream tasks like bias mitigation, preventing malicious adaptation, attribute disentanglement, and generalizable fine-tuning of diffusion policy. We propose Coffee that allows using language to specify undesired concepts to regularize the adaptation process. The crux of our method lies in keeping the embeddings of the user prompt from aligning with undesired concepts. Crucially, Coffee requires no additional training and enables flexible modification of undesired concepts by modifying textual descriptions.

Although existing video-based systems can detect when incidents occur, they provide little insight into how these events unfold across the distinct cognitive phases of pedestrian behavior. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for video understanding, but they remain limited in that they typically process videos in isolation, without explicit temporal structuring or multi-view integration. This paper introduces Multi-view Phase-aware Pedestrian-Vehicle Incident Reasoning (MP-PVIR), a unified framework that systematically processes multi-view video streams into structured diagnostic reports through four stages: (1) event-triggered multi-view video acquisition, (2) pedestrian behavior phase segmentation, (3) phase-specific multi-view reasoning, and (4) hierarchical synthesis and diagnostic reasoning. The framework operationalizes behavioral theory by automatically segmenting incidents into cognitive phases, performing synchronized multi-view analysis within each phase, and synthesizing results into causal chains with targeted prevention strategies. Particularly, two specialized VLMs underpin the MP-PVIR pipeline: TG-VLM for behavioral phase segmentation (mIoU = 0.4881) and PhaVR-VLM for phase-aware multi-view analysis, achieving a captioning score of 33.063 and up to 64.70% accuracy on question answering. Finally, a designated large language model is used to generate comprehensive reports detailing scene understanding, behavior interpretation, causal reasoning, and prevention recommendations. Evaluation on the Woven Traffic Safety dataset shows that MP-PVIR effectively translates multi-view video data into actionable insights, advancing AI-driven traffic safety analytics for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "MP-PVIR \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u3001\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u884c\u4eba-\u8f66\u8f86\u4e8b\u6545\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u9891\u91c7\u96c6\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u5272\u3001\u9636\u6bb5\u5185\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e8b\u6545\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bca\u65ad\u3002\u5229\u7528\u4e13\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08TG-VLM \u548c PhaVR-VLM\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u95ee\u7b54\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5305\u542b\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u9884\u9632\u5efa\u8bae\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u5728 Woven Traffic Safety \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u884c\u4eba-\u8f66\u8f86\u4e8b\u6545\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e8b\u6545\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u884c\u4eba\u8ba4\u77e5\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e3b\u6d41\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5b64\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u7f3a\u5c11\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa MP-PVIR \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u56db\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u83b7\u53d6\u3001\u884c\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u5272\u3001\u9636\u6bb5\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u8bca\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u91c7\u7528 TG-VLM \u8fdb\u884c\u884c\u4e3a\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u5272\uff0cPhaVR-VLM \u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u4f4d\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u8bca\u65ad\u62a5\u544a\u3002", "result": "TG-VLM \u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u5272\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230 mIoU = 0.4881\uff1bPhaVR-VLM \u5728\u63cf\u8ff0\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5f97\u5206 33.063\uff0c\u95ee\u7b54\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe 64.70%\uff1b\u6574\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u5728 Woven Traffic Safety \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u9884\u9632\u7b56\u7565\u5236\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "MP-PVIR \u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u884c\u4eba-\u8f66\u8f86\u4e8b\u6545\u5168\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86 AI \u5728\u4ea4\u901a\u5b89\u5168\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f66\u8def\u534f\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u7684\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

While traditional ensemble prediction (EPS) addresses this through computationally intensive simulations, recent advances in Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL) offer a promising but often disconnected alternative. We bridge these paradigms through a unified hybrid Bayesian Deep Learning framework for ensemble weather forecasting that explicitly decomposes predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components, learned via variational inference and a physics-informed stochastic perturbation scheme modeling flow-dependent atmospheric dynamics, respectively. We further establish a unified theoretical framework that rigorously connects BDL and EPS, providing formal theorems that decompose total predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components under the hybrid BDL framework. We validate our framework on the large-scale 40-year ERA5 reanalysis dataset (1979-2019) with 0.25\u00b0 spatial resolution. Experimental results show that our method not only improves forecast accuracy and yields better-calibrated uncertainty quantification but also achieves superior computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art probabilistic diffusion models.

This capability can open new applications spanning robotics, augmented reality, and logistics. Our approach leverages millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless signals, which can penetrate common occlusions and reflect off hidden objects. In contrast to past mmWave reconstruction methods, which suffer from limited coverage and high noise, Wave-Former introduces a physics-aware shape completion model capable of inferring full 3D geometry. At the heart of Wave-Former's design is a novel three-stage pipeline which bridges raw wireless signals with recent advancements in vision-based shape completion by incorporating physical properties of mmWave signals. The pipeline proposes candidate geometric surfaces, employs a transformer-based shape completion model designed specifically for mmWave signals, and finally performs entropy-guided surface selection. This enables Wave-Former to be trained using entirely synthetic point-clouds, while demonstrating impressive generalization to real-world data.In head-to-head comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines, Wave-Former raises recall from 54% to 72% while maintaining a high precision of 85%.", "AI": {"tldr": "Wave-Former \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\u5b8c\u5168\u906e\u6321\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u65e5\u5e38\u7269\u4f53\u76843D\u5f62\u72b6\u3002\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\uff08mmWave\uff09\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a7f\u900f\u5e38\u89c1\u906e\u6321\u5e76\u53cd\u5c04\u9690\u85cf\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u8865\u5168\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u5f62\u72b6\u8865\u5168\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\u548cmmWave\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9700\u5408\u6210\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4ece54%\u63d0\u5347\u81f372%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u630185%\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfmmWave\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u6709\u9650\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u5efa\u5b8c\u5168\u906e\u6321\u7269\u4f53\u76843D\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u548c\u7269\u6d41\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea63D\u5f62\u72b6\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "Wave-Former\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u7ba1\u9053\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u63d0\u51fa\u5019\u9009\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u9762\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u4e3ammWave\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u8865\u5168\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8868\u9762\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u6574\u4e2a\u6d41\u7a0b\u878d\u5408\u4e86mmWave\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ec5\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e2d\uff0cWave-Former\u5c06\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4ece54%\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u81f372%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u630185%\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u91cd\u5efa\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Wave-Former\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5b8c\u5168\u906e\u6321\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea63D\u5f62\u72b6\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfmmWave\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

We identify the primary bottleneck as the absence of a large-scale dataset that jointly models sketches, photorealistic images, and corresponding natural language instructions. To address this, we present two key contributions: (1) a new, large-scale dataset of image-sketch-instruction triplets designed to facilitate both pretraining and instruction tuning, and (2) O3SLM, an LVLM trained on this dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple sketch-based tasks: (a) object localization, (b) counting, (c) image retrieval i.e., (SBIR and fine-grained SBIR), and (d) visual question answering (VQA); while incorporating the three existing sketch datasets, namely QuickDraw!, Sketchy, and Tu Berlin, along with our generated SketchVCL dataset, show that O3SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming existing LVLMs in sketch comprehension and reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u624b\u7ed8\u8349\u56fe\u7b49\u62bd\u8c61\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u50cf-\u8349\u56fe-\u6307\u4ee4\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86O3SLM\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8349\u56fe\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cO3SLM\u5728\u5bf9\u8c61\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u8ba1\u6570\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u624b\u7ed8\u8349\u56fe\u8fd9\u7c7b\u62bd\u8c61\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u8349\u56fe\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u56fe\u50cf-\u8349\u56fe-\u6307\u4ee4\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9LVLM\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5f97\u5230O3SLM\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "O3SLM\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8349\u56fe\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u8c61\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u8ba1\u6570\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\uff08SBIR\u4e0e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6SBIR\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8349\u56fe\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

This is mainly due to two overlooked risks that affect cross-domain multimodal generalization. The first is the modal representation invariant risk, i.e., whether representations remain generalizable under domain shift. We theoretically show that the inherent class asymmetry in FAS (diverse spoofs vs. compact reals) enlarges the upper bound of generalization error, and this effect is further amplified in multimodal settings. The second is the modal synergy invariant risk, where models overfit to domain-specific inter-modal correlations. Such spurious synergy cannot generalize to unseen attacks in target domains, leading to performance drops. To solve these issues, we propose a provable framework, namely Multimodal Representation and Synergy Invariance Learning (RiSe). For representation risk, RiSe introduces Asymmetric Invariant Risk Minimization (AsyIRM), which learns an invariant spherical decision boundary in radial space to fit asymmetric distributions, while preserving domain cues in angular space. For synergy risk, RiSe employs Multimodal Synergy Disentanglement (MMSD), a self-supervised task enhancing intrinsic, generalizable modal features via cross-sample mixing and disentanglement. Theoretical analysis and experiments verify RiSe, which achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRiSe\u7684\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4eba\u8138\u53cd\u6b3a\u9a97\uff08FAS\uff09\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u4e24\u79cd\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff1a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u540c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0d\u53d8\u98ce\u9669\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff08AsyIRM\uff09\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u540c\u89e3\u8026\uff08MMSD\uff09\uff0cRiSe\u5728\u5f84\u5411\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u53d8\u7403\u5f62\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u89d2\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4fdd\u7559\u57df\u7ebf\u7d22\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u4efb\u52a1\u589e\u5f3a\u8de8\u6837\u672c\u6df7\u5408\u4e0e\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u9886\u5148\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4eba\u8138\u53cd\u6b3a\u9a97\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u57df\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff1a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u540c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u524d\u8005\u7531FAS\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u771f\u5b9e\u6837\u672c\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u4f2a\u9020\u6837\u672c\u591a\u6837\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u653e\u5927\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0a\u754c\uff1b\u540e\u8005\u6e90\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u57df\u5185\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRiSe\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a(1) \u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0d\u53d8\u98ce\u9669\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff08AsyIRM\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5f84\u5411\u7a7a\u95f4\u6784\u5efa\u4e0d\u53d8\u7403\u5f62\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u89d2\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fdd\u7559\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b(2) \u591a\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u540c\u89e3\u8026\uff08MMSD\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u8de8\u6837\u672c\u6df7\u5408\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u3001\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "result": "RiSe\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8de8\u57df\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u4e24\u7c7b\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "RiSe\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u534f\u540c\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001FAS\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, existing robustness benchmarks typically focus on hallucination or misleading textual inputs, while largely overlooking the equally critical challenge posed by misleading visual inputs in assessing visual understanding. To fill this important gap, we introduce MVI-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specially designed for evaluating how Misleading Visual Inputs undermine the robustness of LVLMs. Grounded in fundamental visual primitives, the design of MVI-Bench centers on three hierarchical levels of misleading visual inputs: Visual Concept, Visual Attribute, and Visual Relationship. Using this taxonomy, we curate six representative categories and compile 1,248 expertly annotated VQA instances. To facilitate fine-grained robustness evaluation, we further introduce MVI-Sensitivity, a novel metric that characterizes LVLM robustness at a granular level. Empirical results across 18 state-of-the-art LVLMs uncover pronounced vulnerabilities to misleading visual inputs, and our in-depth analyses on MVI-Bench provide actionable insights that can guide the development of more reliable and robust LVLMs. The benchmark and codebase can be accessed at https://github.com/chenyil6/MVI-Bench.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMVI-Bench\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u672c\u8981\u7d20\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u5206\u7c7b\uff1a\u89c6\u89c9\u6982\u5ff5\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u516d\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u51711,248\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684VQA\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165MVI-Sensitivity\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b018\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41LVLMs\u5728\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5e7b\u89c9\u6216\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u7b49\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4e3a\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u8bef\u5bfc\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1MVI-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4f9d\u636e\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u672c\u8981\u7d20\u5212\u5206\u4e09\u5c42\u6b21\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\uff08\u89c6\u89c9\u6982\u5ff5\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u3001\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u516d\u7c7b\u5178\u578b\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u5e76\u6807\u6ce81,248\u4e2aVQA\u6837\u672c\uff1b\u63d0\u51faMVI-Sensitivity\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u572818\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdbLVLM\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5bf9\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6d1e\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "MVI-Bench\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30LVLM\u5728\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u53d1\u3002\u5f00\u6e90\u8d44\u6e90\u5df2\u53d1\u5e03\uff0c\u4f9b\u7814\u7a76\u793e\u533a\u4f7f\u7528\u3002"}}

Within this domain, short-term prediction of rapid behavioral changes in complex maritime environments has established multimodal trajectory prediction (MTP) as a promising research area. However, existing vessel MTP methods suffer from limited scenario applicability and insufficient explainability. To address these challenges, we propose a unified MTP framework incorporating explainable navigation intentions, which we classify into sustained and transient categories. Our method constructs sustained intention trees from historical trajectories and models dynamic transient intentions using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), while using a non-local attention mechanism to maintain global scenario consistency. Experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) datasets demonstrates our method's broad applicability across diverse scenarios, achieving significant improvements in both ADE and FDE. Furthermore, our method improves explainability by explicitly revealing the navigational intentions underlying each predicted trajectory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8239\u8236\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u822a\u884c\u610f\u56fe\uff08\u5206\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u4e0e\u77ac\u65f6\u6027\u4e24\u7c7b\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6d77\u4e8b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u8f68\u8ff9\u6784\u5efa\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u610f\u56fe\u6811\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08CVAE\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u52a8\u6001\u77ac\u65f6\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4fdd\u6301\u5168\u5c40\u573a\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9eAIS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5728ADE\u548cFDE\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u591f\u660e\u786e\u63ed\u793a\u9884\u6d4b\u8f68\u8ff9\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u822a\u884c\u610f\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8239\u8236\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6d77\u4e8b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u573a\u666f\u9002\u7528\u6027\u6709\u9650\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u5feb\u901f\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u610f\u56fe\u6811\u4ee5\u5206\u6790\u5386\u53f2\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08CVAE\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u52a8\u6001\u77ac\u65f6\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u786e\u4fdd\u5168\u5c40\u573a\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u822a\u884c\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9eAIS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728ADE\u548cFDE\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u6e05\u6670\u63ed\u793a\u9884\u6d4b\u8f68\u8ff9\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u822a\u884c\u610f\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u822a\u884c\u610f\u56fe\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u573a\u666f\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u6d77\u4e8b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, patch-level tokenization leads to a quadratic growth in image tokens, burdening MLLMs' understanding and reasoning with enormous computation and memory. Additionally, the traditional patch-wise scanning tokenization workflow misaligns with the human vision cognition system, further leading to hallucination and computational redundancy. To address this issue, we propose an object-level token merging strategy for Adaptive Token compression, revealing the consistency with human vision system. The experiments are conducted on multiple comprehensive benchmarks, which show that our approach averagely, utilizes only 10% tokens while achieving almost 96% of the vanilla model's performance.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes Dominance-Game Contrastive Learning network for skeleton-based action Recognition (DoGCLR), a self-supervised framework based on game theory. DoGCLR models the construction of positive and negative samples as a dynamic Dominance Game, where both sample types interact to reach an equilibrium that balances semantic preservation and discriminative strength. Specifically, a spatio-temporal dual weight localization mechanism identifies key motion regions and guides region-wise augmentations to enhance motion diversity while maintaining semantics. In parallel, an entropy-driven dominance strategy manages the memory bank by retaining high entropy (hard) negatives and replacing low-entropy (weak) ones, ensuring consistent exposure to informative contrastive signals. Extensive experiments are conducted on NTU RGB+D and PKU-MMD datasets. On NTU RGB+D 60 X-Sub/X-View, DoGCLR achieves 81.1%/89.4% accuracy, and on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Sub/X-Set, DoGCLR achieves 71.2%/75.5% accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 0.1%, 2.7%, 1.1%, and 2.3%, respectively.

Leveraging the common essence of soft effects, i.e., semi-transparent occlusions, we introduce a foundational versatile model UniSER, capable of addressing diverse degradations caused by soft effects within a single framework. Our methodology centers on curating a massive 3.8M-pair dataset to ensure robustness and generalization, which includes novel, physically-plausible data to fill critical gaps in public benchmarks, and a tailored training pipeline that fine-tunes a Diffusion Transformer to learn robust restoration priors from this diverse data, integrating fine-grained mask and strength controls. This synergistic approach allows UniSER to significantly outperform both specialist and generalist models, achieving robust, high-fidelity restoration in the wild.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578bUniSER\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7380\u4e07\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u6269\u6563Transformer\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u8f6f\u6548\u5e94\uff08\u5982\u955c\u5934\u5149\u6655\u3001\u96fe\u973e\u3001\u9634\u5f71\uff09\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e13\u7528\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u8f6f\u6548\u5e94\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5b64\u7acb\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u4e13\u4e00\u6027\u8fc7\u5f3a\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\uff1b\u800c\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u5927\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4fee\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u573a\u666f\u8eab\u4efd\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b380\u4e07\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5927\u578b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u586b\u8865\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u7a7a\u767d\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u6269\u6563Transformer\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a9\u7801\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "UniSER\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e13\u7528\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8f6f\u6548\u5e94\u9000\u5316\u4fee\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "UniSER\u901a\u8fc7\u6355\u6349\u8f6f\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5171\u540c\u672c\u8d28\u2014\u2014\u534a\u900f\u660e\u906e\u6321\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u9000\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

These methods employ a locally supervised approach for semantic supervision, which limits the uniformity of semantic distribution. However, VA-VAE proves that a more uniform feature distribution yields better generation performance. In this work, we introduce a Global Perspective Tokenizer (GloTok), which utilizes global relational information to model a more uniform semantic distribution of tokenized features. Specifically, a codebook-wise histogram relation learning method is proposed to transfer the semantics, which are modeled by pre-trained models on the entire dataset, to the semantic codebook. Then, we design a residual learning module that recovers the fine-grained details to minimize the reconstruction error caused by quantization. Through the above design, GloTok delivers more uniformly distributed semantic latent representations, which facilitates the training of autoregressive (AR) models for generating high-quality images without requiring direct access to pre-trained models during the training process.

Small, imbalanced, and noisy datasets, coupled with high-dimensional and weakly identified clinical features, amplify this multiplicity and make conventional validation schemes unreliable. As a result, selecting among equally performing models becomes uncertain, particularly when resource constraints and operational priorities are not considered by conventional metrics like F1 score. To address these issues, we propose two complementary tools for robust model assessment and selection: Intervention Efficiency (IE) and the Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF). IE is a capacity-aware metric that quantifies how efficiently a model identifies actionable true positives when only limited interventions are feasible, thereby linking predictive performance with clinical utility. PVF introduces a structured approach to assess the stability of models under data perturbations, identifying models whose performance remains most invariant across noisy or shifted validation sets. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world healthcare datasets show that using these tools facilitates the selection of models that generalize more robustly and align with capacity constraints, offering a new direction for tackling the Rashomon Effect in clinical settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u56e0\u591a\u91cd\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u8fd1\uff08\u5373Rashomon\u6548\u5e94\uff09\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u5de5\u5177\uff1a\u5e72\u9884\u6548\u7387\uff08IE\uff09\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff08PVF\uff09\u3002IE\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u5e72\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u771f\u9633\u6027\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u5173\u8054\uff1bPVF\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u6270\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u4e34\u5e8a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684Rashomon\u6548\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u56f0\u96be\uff1b\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u3001\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u53ca\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5f31\u8bc6\u522b\u7279\u5f81\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5982F1\u5206\u6570\u5ffd\u7565\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u64cd\u4f5c\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e72\u9884\u6548\u7387\uff08IE\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bb9\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u5e72\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6270\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff08PVF\uff09\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa\u66f4\u5177\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408IE\u4e0ePVF\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\u3001\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165IE\u4e0ePVF\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684Rashomon\u6548\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u4e34\u5e8a\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

To evaluate the real behavioral safety of AVs controlled in the black box, we present the first end-to-end benchmark dataset collected entirely by autonomous-driving mode in the real world. This dataset contains over 100 hours of naturalistic data from multiple production autonomous-driving vehicle models in the market. We segment the original data into 32,727 key frames, each consisting of four synchronized camera images and high-precision GNSS/IMU data (0.8 cm localization accuracy). For each key frame, 20 Hz vehicle trajectories spanning the past 6 s and future 5 s are provided, along with detailed 2D annotations of surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights, and traffic signs. These key frames have rich scenario-level attributes, including driver intent, area type (covering highways, urban roads, and residential areas), lighting (day, night, or dusk), weather (clear or rain), road surface (paved or unpaved), traffic and vulnerable road users (VRU) density, traffic lights, and traffic signs (warning, prohibition, and indication). To evaluate the safety of AVs, we employ an end-to-end motion planning model that predicts vehicle trajectories with an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 1.4 m on autonomous-driving frames. The dataset continues to expand by over 10 hours of new data weekly, thereby providing a sustainable foundation for research on AV driving behavior analysis and safety evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u7531\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u91c7\u96c6\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8d85\u8fc7100\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u79cd\u91cf\u4ea7\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u578b\u3002\u6570\u636e\u88ab\u5206\u5272\u4e3a32,727\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5e27\uff0c\u6bcf\u5e27\u5305\u542b\u56db\u8def\u540c\u6b65\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6GNSS/IMU\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea60.8\u5398\u7c73\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u524d\u540e\u54046\u79d2\u548c5\u79d2\u768420Hz\u8f66\u8f86\u8f68\u8ff9\u53ca\u8be6\u7ec62D\u6807\u6ce8\uff08\u8f66\u8f86\u3001\u884c\u4eba\u3001\u4ea4\u901a\u706f\u3001\u4ea4\u901a\u6807\u5fd7\uff09\u3002\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u5177\u5907\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u9a7e\u9a76\u610f\u56fe\u3001\u533a\u57df\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u5149\u7167\u3001\u5929\u6c14\u3001\u8def\u9762\u72b6\u51b5\u3001\u4ea4\u901a\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u7b49\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5e27\u4e0a\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\uff08ADE\uff09\u4e3a1.4\u7c73\u3002\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6bcf\u5468\u65b0\u589e\u8d8510\u5c0f\u65f6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5982KITTI\u3001nuScenes\u3001Waymo Perception Dataset\uff09\u591a\u7531\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u6216\u672a\u660e\u786e\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u5f0f\u91c7\u96c6\uff0c\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u4e3a\u771f\u6b63\u8bc4\u4f30\u9ed1\u7bb1\u63a7\u5236\u4e0b\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u5f0f\u91c7\u96c6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6b3e\u5e02\u552e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u5f0f\u91c7\u96c6\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5272\u4e3a32,727\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5e27\uff0c\u6bcf\u5e27\u5305\u542b\u56db\u8def\u540c\u6b65\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6GNSS/IMU\u6570\u636e\uff080.8\u5398\u7c73\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u524d\u540e\u54046\u79d2\u4e0e5\u79d2\u768420Hz\u8f66\u8f86\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u5468\u56f4\u8f66\u8f86\u3001\u884c\u4eba\u3001\u4ea4\u901a\u706f\u3001\u4ea4\u901a\u6807\u5fd7\u7684\u8be6\u7ec62D\u6807\u6ce8\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6807\u6ce8\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u7684\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u533a\u57df\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u5149\u7167\u3001\u5929\u6c14\u3001\u9053\u8def\u8868\u9762\u3001\u4ea4\u901a\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u7c7b\u578b\u7b49\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8d85\u8fc7100\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65f6\u7a7a\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u6ce8\u3002\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5e27\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b01.4\u7c73\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\uff08ADE\uff09\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6bcf\u5468\u65b0\u589e\u8d8510\u5c0f\u65f6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u6301\u7eed\u6269\u5c55\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u5f0f\u91c7\u96c6\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Chamon"], "title": "Learning with Statistical Equality Constraints", "comment": "to be published in the 39th Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems", "summary": "As machine learning applications grow increasingly ubiquitous and complex, they face an increasing set of requirements beyond accuracy. The prevalent approach to handle this challenge is to aggregate a weighted combination of requirement violation penalties into the training objective. To be effective, this approach requires careful tuning of these hyperparameters (weights), involving trial-and-error and cross-validation, which becomes ineffective even for a moderate number of requirements. These issues are exacerbated when the requirements involve parities or equalities, as is the case in fairness and boundary value problems. An alternative technique uses constrained optimization to formulate these learning problems. Yet, existing approximation and generalization guarantees do not apply to problems involving equality constraints. In this work, we derive a generalization theory for equality-constrained statistical learning problems, showing that their solutions can be approximated using samples and rich parametrizations. Using these results, we propose a practical algorithm based on solving a sequence of unconstrained, empirical learning problems. We showcase its effectiveness and the new formulations enabled by equality constraints in fair learning, interpolating classifiers, and boundary value problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u9664\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5916\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u9700\u6c42\uff08\u5982\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u503c\u95ee\u9898\uff09\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u6cdb\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u52a0\u6743\u60e9\u7f5a\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u7e41\u7410\u8c03\u53c2\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5931\u6548\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u6c42\u89e3\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u539f\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u63d2\u503c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u503c\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u65b0\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u4f9d\u8d56\u52a0\u6743\u60e9\u7f5a\u5904\u7406\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5982\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\uff09\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u89e3\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6837\u672c\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u903c\u8fd1\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u539f\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u63d2\u503c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u53ca\u8fb9\u754c\u503c\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6cdb\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u9700\u6c42\u4e0b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u63a7\u5236\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Minimally invasive repairs involving branch vessels necessitate detailed 3D anatomical analysis. Existing methods often overlook hierarchical anatomical relationships while struggling with severe class imbalance inherent in vascular structures. We address these challenges with a curriculum learning strategy that leverages a novel fractal softmax for hierarchical semantic learning. Inspired by human cognition, our approach progressively learns anatomical constraints by decomposing complex structures from simple to complex components. The curriculum learning framework naturally addresses class imbalance by first establishing robust feature representations for dominant classes before tackling rare but anatomically critical structures, significantly accelerating model convergence in multi-class scenarios. Our two-stage inference strategy achieves up to fivefold acceleration, enhancing clinical practicality. On the validation set at epoch 50, our hierarchical semantic loss improves the Dice score of nnU-Net ResEnc M by 11.65%. The proposed model demonstrates a 5.6% higher Dice score than baselines on the test set. Experimental results show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and efficiency, making the framework suitable for real-time clinical applications.

However, this distributed learning paradigm faces several security threats, particularly to its integrity, such as backdoor attacks that aim to inject malicious behavior during the local training steps of certain clients. We present the first analysis of the influence of LoRA on state-of-the-art backdoor attacks targeting model adaptation in FL. Specifically, we focus on backdoor lifespan, a critical characteristic in FL, that can vary depending on the attack scenario and the attacker's ability to effectively inject the backdoor.

However, existing general-to-customized CMR methods typically assume that the entire target-domain data is available, which is easily violated in real-world scenarios and thus inevitably suffer from the query shift (QS) problem. Specifically, query shift embraces the following two characteristics and thus poses new challenges to CMR. i) Online Shift: real-world queries always arrive in an online manner, rendering it impractical to access the entire query set beforehand for customization approaches; ii) Diverse Shift: even with domain customization, the CMR models struggle to satisfy queries from diverse users or scenarios, leaving an urgent need to accommodate diverse queries. In this paper, we observe that QS would not only undermine the well-structured common space inherited from the source model, but also steer the model toward forgetting the indispensable general knowledge for CMR. Inspired by the observations, we propose a novel method for achieving online and harmonious adaptation against QS, dubbed Robust adaptation with quEry ShifT (REST). To deal with online shift, REST first refines the retrieval results to formulate the query predictions and accordingly designs a QS-robust objective function on these predictions to preserve the well-established common space in an online manner. As for tackling the more challenging diverse shift, REST employs a gradient decoupling module to dexterously manipulate the gradients during the adaptation process, thus preventing the CMR model from forgetting the general knowledge. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across three CMR tasks verify the effectiveness of our method against QS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\uff08CMR\uff09\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u504f\u79fb\uff08QS\uff09\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aREST\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u5e94\u5bf9\u5728\u7ebf\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u591a\u6837\u504f\u79fb\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u9884\u6d4b\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u7ef4\u6301\u901a\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u89e3\u8026\u6a21\u5757\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u9057\u5fd8\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u572820\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u7528\u5230\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u5168\u90e8\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u67e5\u8be2\u662f\u5728\u7ebf\u5230\u8fbe\u4e14\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\u591a\u6837\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u67e5\u8be2\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faREST\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u89e3\u8026\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u901a\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u77e5\u8bc6\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "result": "\u572820\u4e2a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cREST\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u67e5\u8be2\u504f\u79fb\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "REST\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u89e3\u8026\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u591a\u6837\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, some existing vessel Re-ID methods are directly adapted from pedestrian-focused algorithms, making them ill-suited for mitigating the unique problems present in vessel images, particularly the greater intra-identity variations and more severe missing of local parts, which lead to the emergence of outlier samples within the same identity. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-scale Correlation-aware Transformer Network (MCFormer), which explicitly models multi-scale correlations across the entire input set to suppress the adverse effects of outlier samples with intra-identity variations or local missing, incorporating two novel modules, the Global Correlation Module (GCM), and the Local Correlation Module (LCM). Specifically, GCM constructs a global similarity affinity matrix across all input images to model global correlations through feature aggregation based on inter-image consistency, rather than solely learning features from individual images as in most existing approaches. Simultaneously, LCM mines and aligns local features of positive samples with contextual similarity to extract local correlations by maintaining a dynamic memory bank, effectively compensating for missing or occluded regions in individual images. To further enhance feature robustness, MCFormer integrates global and local features that have been respectively correlated across multiple scales, effectively capturing latent relationships among image features.

Recently, we introduced ComplexEye, a multi-lens array microscope comprising 16 independent aberration-corrected glass lenses arranged at the pitch of a 96-well plate, capable of capturing high-resolution movies of migrating cells. This architecture enables high-throughput live-cell video microscopy for migration analysis, supporting routine quantification of autonomous motility with strong potential for clinical translation. However, ComplexEye and similar high-throughput imaging platforms generate data at an exponential rate, imposing substantial burdens on storage and transmission. To address this challenge, we present FlowRoI, a fast optical-flow-based region of interest (RoI) extraction framework designed for high-throughput image compression in immune cell migration studies. FlowRoI estimates optical flow between consecutive frames and derives RoI masks that reliably cover nearly all migrating cells. The raw image and its corresponding RoI mask are then jointly encoded using JPEG2000 to enable RoI-aware compression. FlowRoI operates with high computational efficiency, achieving runtimes comparable to standard JPEG2000 and reaching an average throughput of about 30 frames per second on a modern laptop equipped with an Intel i7-1255U CPU.

Diffusion-based priors currently deliver state-of-the-art reconstructions, but existing approaches either adapt image diffusion models with ad hoc temporal regularizers - leading to temporal artifacts - or rely on native video diffusion models whose iterative posterior sampling is far too slow for real-time use. We introduce InstantViR, an amortized inference framework for ultra-fast video reconstruction powered by a pre-trained video diffusion prior. We distill a powerful bidirectional video diffusion model (teacher) into a causal autoregressive student that maps a degraded video directly to its restored version in a single forward pass, inheriting the teacher's strong temporal modeling while completely removing iterative test-time optimization. The distillation is prior-driven: it only requires the teacher diffusion model and known degradation operators, and does not rely on externally paired clean/noisy video data. To further boost throughput, we replace the video-diffusion backbone VAE with a high-efficiency LeanVAE via an innovative teacher-space regularized distillation scheme, enabling low-latency latent-space processing. Across streaming random inpainting, Gaussian deblurring and super-resolution, InstantViR matches or surpasses the reconstruction quality of diffusion-based baselines while running at over 35 FPS on NVIDIA A100 GPUs, achieving up to 100 times speedups over iterative video diffusion solvers.

In this paper, we demonstrate the severity of this restriction and introduce a simple yet powerful technique, mirage infusion, which enables diffusion models to change the state of the atoms that make up the crystal from existent to non-existent (mirage) and vice versa. We show that this technique improves model quality by up to $\\times2.5$ compared to the same model without this modification. The resulting model, Mirage Atom Diffusion (MiAD), is an equivariant joint diffusion model for de novo crystal generation that is capable of altering the number of atoms during the generation process.

However, some fundamental cardiac biomarkers of interest, including stroke volume and cardiac output, require invasive measurements, e.g., arterial pressure waveforms (APW). As a non-invasive alternative, photoplethysmography (PPG) measurements are routinely collected in hospital settings. Unfortunately, the prediction of key cardiac biomarkers from PPG instead of APW remains an open challenge, further complicated by the scarcity of annotated PPG measurements. As a solution, we propose a hybrid approach that uses hemodynamic simulations and unlabeled clinical data to estimate cardiovascular biomarkers directly from PPG signals. Our hybrid model combines a conditional variational autoencoder trained on paired PPG-APW data with a conditional density estimator of cardiac biomarkers trained on labeled simulated APW segments.

However, existing methods typically produce deterministic results, struggling to capture this one-to-many nature. In this paper, we propose a Measurement-Constrained Sampling (MCS) approach that enables diverse LQ face reconstructions conditioned on different textual prompts. Specifically, we formulate BFR as a measurement-constrained generative task by constructing an inverse problem through controlled degradations of coarse restorations, which allows posterior-guided sampling within text-to-image diffusion.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel autoregressive diffusion model that processes input audio in a streaming manner. This design ensures flexibility with varying audio lengths and achieves low latency independent of audio duration. Specifically, we select a limited number of past frames as historical motion context and combine them with the audio input to create a dynamic condition. This condition guides the diffusion process to iteratively generate facial motion frames, enabling real-time synthesis with high-quality results. Additionally, we implemented a real-time interactive demo, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

Current approaches face a fundamental tradeoff: custom implementations like TransformerLens ensure consistent interfaces but require coding a manual adaptation for each architecture, introducing numerical mismatch with the original models, while direct HuggingFace access through NNsight preserves exact behavior but lacks standardization across models. To bridge this gap, we develop nnterp, a lightweight wrapper around NNsight that provides a unified interface for transformer analysis while preserving original HuggingFace implementations. Through automatic module renaming and comprehensive validation testing, nnterp enables researchers to write intervention code once and deploy it across 50+ model variants spanning 16 architecture families. The library includes built-in implementations of common interpretability methods (logit lens, patchscope, activation steering) and provides direct access to attention probabilities for models that support it. By packaging validation tests with the library, researchers can verify compatibility with custom models locally. nnterp bridges the gap between correctness and usability in mechanistic interpretability tooling.", "AI": {"tldr": "nnterp \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5c01\u88c5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e NNsight \u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u7684 Transformer \u5206\u6790\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u517c\u987e HuggingFace \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u6a21\u5757\u91cd\u547d\u540d\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728 50+ \u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u4f53\u300116 \u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e2d\u590d\u7528\u5e72\u9884\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u5185\u7f6e\u5e38\u89c1\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982 logit lens\u3001patchscope\u3001activation steering\uff09\u53ca\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6982\u7387\u8bbf\u95ee\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6613\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u5b9e\u73b0\uff08\u5982 TransformerLens\uff09\u867d\u5177\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u63a5\u53e3\u4f46\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u9002\u914d\u5404\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6613\u5f15\u5165\u6570\u503c\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u800c\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528 HuggingFace \u7684 NNsight \u867d\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5374\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u5177\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "nnterp \u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u91cd\u547d\u540d\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u96c6\u6210\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5c06 NNsight \u4e0e HuggingFace \u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u7f1d\u5bf9\u63a5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u63a5\u53e3\u3002\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u517c\u5bb9\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u5185\u7f6e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5e72\u9884\u4ee3\u7801\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u53ef\u9760\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "result": "nnterp \u53ef\u5728 50+ \u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u4f53\u300116 \u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u6b21\u7f16\u5199\u3001\u591a\u5904\u90e8\u7f72\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u5e38\u89c1\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6982\u7387\u8bbf\u95ee\uff1b\u5185\u7f6e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u672c\u5730\u9a8c\u8bc1\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u6a21\u578b\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "nnterp \u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5de5\u5177\u4e2d\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u4e3a\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u7684 Transformer \u5185\u90e8\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, given access to some data from downstream tasks, a natural question arises: can the performance of these models be further improved? To this end, we propose WeSTAR, a parameter-efficient framework that performs Weakly supervised Self-Training Adaptation with Regularization, designed to enhance the robustness of MDE foundation models in unseen and diverse domains. We first adopt a dense self-training objective as the primary source of structural self-supervision. To further improve robustness, we introduce semantically-aware hierarchical normalization, which exploits instance-level segmentation maps to perform more stable and multi-scale structural normalization. Beyond dense supervision, we introduce a cost-efficient weak supervision in the form of pairwise ordinal depth annotations to further guide the adaptation process, which enforces informative ordinal constraints to mitigate local topological errors. Finally, a weight regularization loss is employed to anchor the LoRA updates, ensuring training stability and preserving the model's generalizable knowledge. Extensive experiments on both realistic and corrupted out-of-distribution datasets under diverse and challenging scenarios demonstrate that WeSTAR consistently improves generalization and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "WeSTAR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u9002\u5e94\u4e0e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08MDE\uff09\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc6\u96c6\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u3001\u6210\u5bf9\u5e8f\u6570\u6df1\u5ea6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u4ee5\u53ca\u6743\u91cd\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5982Depth Anything\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u5df2\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e9f\u5f85\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faWeSTAR\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u5bc6\u96c6\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u6210\u5bf9\u5e8f\u6570\u6df1\u5ea6\u6807\u6ce8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u7ea6\u675f\u5c40\u90e8\u62d3\u6251\u9519\u8bef\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u6743\u91cd\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u786e\u4fddLoRA\u66f4\u65b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u53d7\u635f\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cWeSTAR\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "WeSTAR\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u673a\u5236\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the inherent temporal heterogeneous induced by localized perturbations present significant challenges for generating structurally consistent time series. While flow matching provides a promising paradigm by modeling temporal dynamics through trajectory-level supervision, it fails to adequately capture abrupt transitions in perturbed time series, as the use of globally shared parameters constrains the velocity field to a unified representation. To address these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{PAFM}, a \\textbf{P}erturbation-\\textbf{A}ware \\textbf{F}low \\textbf{M}atching framework that models perturbed trajectories to ensure stable and structurally consistent time series generation. The framework incorporates perturbation-guided training to simulate localized disturbances and leverages a dual-path velocity field to capture trajectory deviations under perturbation, enabling refined modeling of perturbed behavior to enhance the structural coherence. In order to further improve sensitivity to trajectory perturbations while enhancing expressiveness, a mixture-of-experts decoder with flow routing dynamically allocates modeling capacity in response to different trajectory dynamics. Extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional generation tasks demonstrate that PAFM consistently outperforms strong baselines.

To tackle this challenge, we propose a robust GNSS-free collaborative perception framework based on LiDAR localization. Specifically, we propose a lightweight Pose Generator with Confidence (PGC) to estimate compact pose and confidence representations. To alleviate the effects of localization errors, we further develop the Pose-Aware Spatio-Temporal Alignment Transformer (PASTAT), which performs confidence-aware spatial alignment while capturing essential temporal context. Additionally, we present a new simulation dataset, V2VLoc, which can be adapted for both LiDAR localization and collaborative detection tasks. V2VLoc comprises three subsets: Town1Loc, Town4Loc, and V2VDet. Town1Loc and Town4Loc offer multi-traversal sequences for training in localization tasks, whereas V2VDet is specifically intended for the collaborative detection task.

Recent offloading systems migrate the KVCache to CPU memory and incorporate top-k attention to reduce the volume of data transferred from the CPU, while further applying system-level optimizations such as on-GPU caching and prefetching to lower transfer overhead. However, they overlook the CPU bottleneck in three aspects: (1) substantial overhead of fine-grained dynamic cache management performed on the CPU side, (2) significant transfer overhead from poor PCIe bandwidth utilization caused by heavy gathering operations at the CPU side, and (3) GPU runtime bubbles introduced by coarse-grained CPU-centric synchronization. To address these challenges, we propose CLO, a CPU-light KVCache offloading system via algorithm-system co-design. CLO features: (1) a coarse-grained head-wise approximate on-GPU caching strategy with negligible cache management cost, (2) seamless combination of data prefetching and on-GPU persistent caching for lower transfer overhead, (3) a zero-copy transfer engine to fully exploit PCIe bandwidth, and a GPU-centric synchronization method to eliminate GPU stalls. Evaluation on two widely-used LLMs demonstrates that CLO achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art systems, while substantially minimizing CPU overhead, fully utilizing PCIe bandwidth, thus improving decoding throughput by 9.3%-66.6%.

Building upon ManipBench, we propose \\textbf{ManipShield}, an all-in-one model based on a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that leverages contrastive LoRA fine-tuning and task-specific decoders to achieve unified image manipulation detection, localization, and explanation. Extensive experiments on ManipBench and several public datasets demonstrate that ManipShield achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generality to unseen manipulation models. Both ManipBench and ManipShield will be released upon publication.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faManipBench\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u548cManipShield\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u7be1\u6539\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u8986\u76d6\u6709\u9650\u53ca\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002ManipBench\u5305\u542b45\u4e07+\u5f20\u753125\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6db5\u76d612\u7c7b\u7be1\u6539\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d10\u4e07\u5f20\u914d\u6709\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u3001\u5224\u65ad\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u6587\u672c\u89e3\u91ca\uff1bManipShield\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u9886\u5148\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u7be1\u6539\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff08IMDL\uff09\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u5bb9\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u7a84\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u968f\u7740\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u5df2\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b0\u578b\u9ad8\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaManipBench\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d625\u79cd\u524d\u6cbf\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u768445\u4e07+\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c12\u7c7b\u7be1\u6539\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d10\u4e07\u5f20\u542b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6807\u6ce8\uff08\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u3001\u5224\u65ad\u7ebf\u7d22\u3001\u6587\u672c\u89e3\u91ca\uff09\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1ManipShield\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u7528\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7be1\u6539\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "ManipShield\u5728ManipBench\u53ca\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u7be1\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684ManipBench\u4e0eManipShield\u5c06\u5728\u8bba\u6587\u53d1\u8868\u540e\u516c\u5f00\u3002", "conclusion": "ManipBench\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u7be1\u6539\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u591a\u6837\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\uff0cManipShield\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u590d\u6742\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, two critical limitations of t-SVD methods persist: (1) the approximation of the latent tensor (e.g., tensor factorizations) is coarse and fails to accurately capture spatial local high-frequency information; (2) The transform matrix is composed of fixed basis atoms (e.g., complex exponential atoms in DFT and cosine atoms in DCT) and cannot precisely capture local high-frequency information along the mode-3 fibers. To address these two limitations, we propose a Gaussian Splatting-based Low-rank tensor Representation (GSLR) framework, which compactly and continuously represents multi-dimensional images. Specifically, we leverage tailored 2D Gaussian splatting and 1D Gaussian splatting to generate the latent tensor and transform matrix, respectively. The 2D and 1D Gaussian splatting are indispensable and complementary under this representation framework, which enjoys a powerful representation capability, especially for local high-frequency information. To evaluate the representation ability of the proposed GSLR, we develop an unsupervised GSLR-based multi-dimensional image recovery model.

This heterogeneous structure presents significant challenges for existing diffusion-based imputation models, which typically assume a homogeneous feature space and rely on stochastic denoising trajectories. Such assumptions make it difficult to maintain conditional consistency, and they often lead to information collapse for categorical variables or instability when numerical variables require deterministic updates. These limitations indicate that a single diffusion process is insufficient for mixed-type tabular imputation.\n  We propose a hybrid deterministic diffusion framework that separates heterogeneous features into two complementary generative channels. A continuous DDIM-based channel provides efficient and stable deterministic denoising for numerical variables, while a discrete latent-path diffusion channel, inspired by loopholing-based discrete diffusion, models categorical and discrete features without leaving their valid sample manifolds. The two channels are trained under a unified conditional imputation objective, enabling coherent reconstruction of mixed-type incomplete data.\n  Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that the proposed framework achieves higher imputation accuracy, more stable sampling trajectories, and improved robustness across MCAR, MAR, and MNAR settings compared with existing diffusion-based and classical methods. These results demonstrate the importance of structure-aware diffusion processes for advancing deep learning approaches to incomplete tabular data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u5305\u542b\u6570\u503c\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u751f\u6210\u901a\u9053\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eDDIM\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u901a\u9053\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u7a33\u5b9a\u5730\u5bf9\u6570\u503c\u53d8\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53bb\u566a\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6f5c\u5728\u8def\u5f84\u6269\u6563\u901a\u9053\u5219\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u53d8\u91cf\u5728\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6837\u672c\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u4e24\u8005\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u63d2\u8865\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6df7\u5408\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u91cd\u5efa\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u7c7b\u7f3a\u5931\u673a\u5236\uff08MCAR\u3001MAR\u3001MNAR\uff09\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u63d2\u8865\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u540c\u8d28\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u968f\u673a\u53bb\u566a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u6761\u4ef6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7c7b\u522b\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u574d\u584c\uff0c\u6216\u5728\u9700\u8981\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u503c\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0a\u51fa\u73b0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u5355\u4e00\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6df7\u5408\u7c7b\u578b\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u63d2\u8865\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5f02\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u901a\u9053\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eDDIM\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u503c\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53bb\u566a\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6f5c\u5728\u8def\u5f84\u6269\u6563\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u4e0d\u8131\u79bb\u6709\u6548\u6837\u672c\u6d41\u5f62\u3002\u4e24\u901a\u9053\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u6761\u4ef6\u63d2\u8865\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u7c7b\u578b\u534f\u540c\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5404\u7c7b\u7f3a\u5931\u673a\u5236\uff08MCAR\u3001MAR\u3001MNAR\uff09\u4e0b\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63d2\u8865\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bf9\u63a8\u8fdb\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u5f02\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u751f\u6210\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u7c7b\u578b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u63d2\u8865\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

First, they struggle with coarse semantic alignment, often failing to capture fine-grained prompt details. Second, they lack robust 3D spatial understanding, leading to geometric inconsistencies and catastrophic failures in part assembly and spatial relationships. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a general framework that repurposes large vision-language models (VLMs) as powerful, differentiable semantic and spatial critics. Our core contribution is a dual-query critic signal derived from the VLM's Yes or No log-odds, which assesses both semantic fidelity and geometric coherence. We demonstrate the generality of this guidance signal across two distinct paradigms: (1) As a reward objective for optimization-based pipelines, VLM3D significantly outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks. (2) As a test-time guidance module for feed-forward pipelines, it actively steers the iterative sampling process of SOTA native 3D models to correct severe spatial errors. VLM3D establishes a principled and generalizable path to inject the VLM's rich, language-grounded understanding of both semantics and space into diverse 3D generative pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "VLM3D\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u6279\u8bc4\u8005\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u67e5\u8be2\u6279\u8bc4\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u662f/\u5426\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\uff09\u540c\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u578b\u548c\u524d\u9988\u578b3D\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u7ea0\u6b63\u4e25\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u79cd3D\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u6ce8\u5165\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u8a00-\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u52303D\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c3D\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVLM3D\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u53cc\u67e5\u8be2\u6279\u8bc4\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u662f/\u5426\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u8be5\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u578b\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u76ee\u6807\u6216\u524d\u9988\u578b\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u4fee\u6b63\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cVLM3D\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u578b\u548c\u524d\u9988\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7ea0\u6b63\u590d\u6742\u90e8\u4ef6\u88c5\u914d\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "conclusion": "VLM3D\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u539f\u7406\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u901a\u7528\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00-\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u591a\u6837\u5316\u76843D\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u52303D\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, projecting datasets in lower dimensions often entails some distortion, which is not necessarily easy to recognize but can lead users to misleading conclusions. Several Projection Quality Metrics (PQMs) have been developed as tools to quantify the goodness-of-fit of a DR projection; however, they mostly focus on measuring how well the projection captures the global or local structure of the data, without taking into account the visual distortion of the resulting plots, thus often ignoring the presence of outliers or artifacts that can mislead a visual analysis of the projection. In this work, we introduce the Warping Index (WI), a new metric for measuring the quality of DR projections onto the 2D plane, based on the assumption that the correct preservation of empty regions between points is of crucial importance towards a faithful visual representation of the data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6295\u5f71\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u626d\u66f2\u6307\u6570\uff08Warping Index, WI\uff09\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u964d\u7ef4\uff08DR\uff09\u6295\u5f71\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5168\u5c40\u6216\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cWI\u7279\u522b\u5f3a\u8c03\u7a7a\u533a\u57df\uff08\u5373\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u7a7a\u95f4\uff09\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u533a\u57df\u5bf9\u4e8e\u907f\u514d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bef\u5bfc\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u53ef\u80fd\u7531\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u6216\u4f2a\u5f71\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08PQMs\uff09\u5927\u591a\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6216\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6295\u5f71\u56fe\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u5982\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u6216\u4f2a\u5f71\u9020\u6210\u7684\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7528\u6237\u5f97\u51fa\u9519\u8bef\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a7a\u533a\u57df\u4fdd\u7559\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u626d\u66f2\u6307\u6570\uff08WI\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u6295\u5f71\u524d\u540e\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7a7a\u533a\u57df\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u6295\u5f71\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6216\u5931\u771f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u51fa\u4f20\u7edf\u5ea6\u91cf\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u6216\u975e\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u964d\u7ef4\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u626d\u66f2\u6307\u6570\uff08WI\uff09\u4e3a\u964d\u7ef4\u6295\u5f71\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u3001\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u9632\u6b62\u56e0\u89c6\u89c9\u5931\u771f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8bef\u5224\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002"}}

However, despite the abundance of \\textit{closed-vocabulary} models that are not pre-trained with language supervision, applying task arithmetic to these models remains unexplored. In this paper, we deploy and study task addition in closed-vocabulary image classification models. We consider different pre-training schemes and find that \\textit{weight disentanglement} -- the property enabling task arithmetic -- is a general consequence of pre-training, as it appears in different pre-trained closed-vocabulary models. In fact, we find that pre-trained closed-vocabulary vision transformers can also be edited with task arithmetic, achieving high task addition performance and enabling the efficient deployment of multi-task models. Finally, we demonstrate that simple linear probing is a competitive baseline to task addition.

While recent approaches have explored episodic memory (Reflexion), gradient-based prompt optimization (TextGrad),and hierarchical task decomposition independently, their potential for synergistic integration remains unexplored. We introduce ReflexGrad, a novel architecture that tightly couples three complementary mechanisms: (1) LLM-based hierarchical TODO decomposition for strategic planning, (2) history-aware causal reflection that analyzes recent action patterns to identify failure root causes and enable within-trial learning, and (3) gradient-based optimization for systematic improvement. Unlike prior work relying on few-shot demonstrations, our system achieves true zero-shot generalization through pure LLM semantic reasoning,requiring no task-specific examples, fine-tuning, or hardcoded similarity metrics. Evaluated on ALFWorld benchmark tasks, ReflexGrad demonstrates 67% zero-shot success rate on Trial 0 without any prior task experience or demonstrations, establishing effective performance on first exposure.

During surgery, these plans must be accurately transferred, relying on precise cross-registration between preoperative and intraoperative data. However, substantial modality heterogeneity across imaging modalities makes this registration challenging and error-prone. Robust, automatic, and modality-agnostic bone surface registration is therefore clinically important. We propose NeuralBoneReg, a self-supervised, surface-based framework that registers bone surfaces using 3D point clouds as a modality-agnostic representation. NeuralBoneReg includes two modules: an implicit neural unsigned distance field (UDF) that learns the preoperative bone model, and an MLP-based registration module that performs global initialization and local refinement by generating transformation hypotheses to align the intraoperative point cloud with the neural UDF. Unlike SOTA supervised methods, NeuralBoneReg operates in a self-supervised manner, without requiring inter-subject training data. We evaluated NeuralBoneReg against baseline methods on two publicly available multi-modal datasets: a CT-ultrasound dataset of the fibula and tibia (UltraBones100k) and a CT-RGB-D dataset of spinal vertebrae (SpineDepth). The evaluation also includes a newly introduced CT--ultrasound dataset of cadaveric subjects containing femur and pelvis (UltraBones-Hip), which will be made publicly available. NeuralBoneReg matches or surpasses existing methods across all datasets, achieving mean RRE/RTE of 1.68\u00b0/1.86 mm on UltraBones100k, 1.88\u00b0/1.89 mm on UltraBones-Hip, and 3.79\u00b0/2.45 mm on SpineDepth.

CI methods fail to leverage the potential insights from inter-channel interactions, resulting in models that may not fully exploit the underlying statistical dependencies present in the data.

To address these issues, we introduce the Adaptive Forecasting Transformer (\\textbf{Adapformer}), an advanced Transformer-based framework that merges the benefits of CI and CD methodologies through effective channel management.

However, practical systems are often constrained by ultra-sparse-view sampling, which significantly degrades reconstruction quality. Traditional methods struggle under ultra-sparse-view settings, where interpolation becomes inaccurate and the resulting reconstructions are unsatisfactory. To address this challenge, this study proposes Diffusion-Refined Neural Attenuation Fields (Diff-NAF), an iterative framework tailored for multi-source stationary CT under ultra-sparse-view conditions. Diff-NAF combines a Neural Attenuation Field representation with a dual-branch conditional diffusion model. The process begins by training an initial NAF using ultra-sparse-view projections. New projections are then generated through an Angle-Prior Guided Projection Synthesis strategy that exploits inter view priors, and are subsequently refined by a Diffusion-driven Reuse Projection Refinement Module.

While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) shows promise for novel view synthesis, its application to the standard clinical triad of unposed anterior and bilateral buccal photographs is challenging. The large view baselines, inconsistent illumination, and specular surfaces common in intraoral settings can destabilize simultaneous pose and geometry estimation. Furthermore, sparse-view photometric supervision often induces a frequency bias, leading to over-smoothed reconstructions that lose critical diagnostic details. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{Dental3R}, a pose-free, graph-guided pipeline for robust, high-fidelity reconstruction from sparse intraoral photographs. Our method first constructs a Geometry-Aware Pairing Strategy (GAPS) to intelligently select a compact subgraph of high-value image pairs. The GAPS focuses on correspondence matching, thereby improving the stability of the geometry initialization and reducing memory usage. Building on the recovered poses and point cloud, we train the 3DGS model with a wavelet-regularized objective. By enforcing band-limited fidelity using a discrete wavelet transform, our approach preserves fine enamel boundaries and interproximal edges while suppressing high-frequency artifacts. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset of 950 clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases.

However, existing deep-learning approaches rely heavily on modality-specific training, large annotated datasets, and controlled scanning conditions, which limit generalization across devices and hinder deployment in real clinical workflows. Moreover, raw intraoral meshes exhibit substantial variation in arch pose, incomplete geometry caused by occlusion or tooth contact, and a lack of texture cues, making unified semantic interpretation highly challenging. To address these limitations, we propose ArchMap, a training-free and knowledge-guided framework for robust structured dental understanding. ArchMap first introduces a geometry-aware arch-flattening module that standardizes raw 3D meshes into spatially aligned, continuity-preserving multi-view projections. We then construct a Dental Knowledge Base (DKB) encoding hierarchical tooth ontology, dentition-stage policies, and clinical semantics to constrain the symbolic reasoning space. We validate ArchMap on 1060 pre-/post-orthodontic cases, demonstrating robust performance in tooth counting, anatomical partitioning, dentition-stage classification, and the identification of clinical conditions such as crowding, missing teeth, prosthetics, and caries.

These factors hinder the stability of appearance-based similarity metrics and often lead to convergence failures or anatomically implausible alignments. To address these limitations, we propose DentalSCR, a pose-stable, contour-guided framework for accurate and interpretable silhouette-to-contour registration. Our method first constructs a U-Midline Dental Axis (UMDA) to establish a unified cross-arch anatomical coordinate system, thereby stabilizing initialization and standardizing projection geometry across cases. Using this reference frame, we generate radiograph-like projections via a surface-based DRR formulation with coronal-axis perspective and Gaussian splatting, which preserves clinical source-object-detector magnification and emphasizes external silhouettes. Registration is then formulated as a 2D similarity transform optimized with a symmetric bidirectional Chamfer distance under a hierarchical coarse-to-fine schedule, enabling both large capture range and subpixel-level contour agreement. We evaluate DentalSCR on 34 expert-annotated clinical cases. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reductions in landmark error-particularly at posterior teeth-tighter dispersion on the lower jaw, and low Chamfer and controlled Hausdorff distances at the curve level. These findings indicate that DentalSCR robustly handles real-world cephalograms and delivers high-fidelity, clinically inspectable 3D--2D alignment, outperforming conventional baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDentalSCR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8de8\u7259\u5f13\u89e3\u5256\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\uff08UMDA\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8868\u9762\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u91cd\u5efa\u5c04\u7ebf\u56fe\uff08DRR\uff09\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u771f\u5b9e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u53e3\u5185\u626b\u63cf\u4e0e\u4fa7\u4f4d\u5934\u9885\u7247\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u8f6e\u5ed3\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u7c97\u5230\u7cbe\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u53cc\u5411\u5207\u6bd4\u96ea\u592b\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u6295\u5f71\u653e\u5927\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u5931\u771f\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u540e\u7259\u533a\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u988c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u66f2\u7ebf\u5c42\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u5207\u6bd4\u96ea\u592b\u4e0e\u53d7\u63a7\u8c6a\u65af\u591a\u592b\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u914d\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u56e0\u5934\u9885\u7247\u5b58\u5728\u6295\u5f71\u653e\u5927\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u5931\u771f\u3001\u7259\u51a0\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u4f4e\u53ca\u6210\u50cf\u5dee\u5f02\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5916\u89c2\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u6536\u655b\u5931\u8d25\u6216\u89e3\u5256\u4e0a\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u76843D-2D\u914d\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDentalSCR\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u6784\u5efaU-Midline Dental Axis (UMDA)\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8de8\u7259\u5f13\u89e3\u5256\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5e76\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6295\u5f71\u51e0\u4f55\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8868\u9762\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u91cd\u5efa\u5c04\u7ebf\u56fe\uff08DRR\uff09\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u51a0\u72b6\u8f74\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0e\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\u4e91\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u6e90-\u7269-\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u653e\u5927\u5173\u7cfb\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u5916\u90e8\u8f6e\u5ed3\uff1b\u6ce8\u518c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u7c97\u5230\u7cbe\u76842D\u76f8\u4f3c\u53d8\u6362\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u5bf9\u79f0\u53cc\u5411\u5207\u6bd4\u96ea\u592b\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e3a\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u6355\u83b7\u4e0e\u4e9a\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u8f6e\u5ed3\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u572834\u4f8b\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cDentalSCR\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u540e\u7259\u533a\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4e0b\u988c\u5206\u5e03\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\uff0c\u66f2\u7ebf\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5207\u6bd4\u96ea\u592b\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u8c6a\u65af\u591a\u592b\u8ddd\u79bb\u5747\u8f83\u4f4e\u4e14\u53ef\u63a7\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u914d\u51c6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u68c0\u67e5\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DentalSCR\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u591a\u53d8\u7684\u5934\u9885\u7247\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u7cbe\u51c6\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u76843D-2D\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e3a\u6b63\u7578\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u50cf\u878d\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Alvarez", "Miaomiao Liu"], "title": "IBGS: Image-Based Gaussian Splatting", "comment": "Accepted to NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a fast, high-quality method for novel view synthesis (NVS). However, its use of low-degree spherical harmonics limits its ability to capture spatially varying color and view-dependent effects such as specular highlights. Existing works augment Gaussians with either a global texture map, which struggles with complex scenes, or per-Gaussian texture maps, which introduces high storage overhead. We propose Image-Based Gaussian Splatting, an efficient alternative that leverages high-resolution source images for fine details and view-specific color modeling. Specifically, we model each pixel color as a combination of a base color from standard 3DGS rendering and a learned residual inferred from neighboring training images.

To this end, we propose the first texture-enabled physical adversarial attack against stereo matching models in the context of autonomous driving. Our method employs a 3D PAE with global camouflage texture rather than a local 2D patch-based one, ensuring both visual consistency and attack effectiveness across different viewpoints of stereo cameras. To cope with the disparity effect of these cameras, we also propose a new 3D stereo matching rendering module that allows the PAE to be aligned with real-world positions and headings in binocular vision. We further propose a novel merging attack that seamlessly blends the target into the environment through fine-grained PAE optimization.

However, current LLM-based driving agents lack explicit mechanisms to enforce traffic rules and often struggle to reliably detect small, safety-critical objects such as traffic lights and signs. To address this limitation, we introduce TLS-Assist, a modular redundancy layer that augments LLM-based autonomous driving agents with explicit traffic light and sign recognition. TLS-Assist converts detections into structured natural language messages that are injected into the LLM input, enforcing explicit attention to safety-critical cues.

Project website: https://bedlam2.is.tue.mpg.de", "summary": "Inferring 3D human motion from video remains a challenging problem with many applications. While traditional methods estimate the human in image coordinates, many applications require human motion to be estimated in world coordinates. This is particularly challenging when there is both human and camera motion. Progress on this topic has been limited by the lack of rich video data with ground truth human and camera movement. We address this with BEDLAM2.0, a new dataset that goes beyond the popular BEDLAM dataset in important ways. In addition to introducing more diverse and realistic cameras and camera motions, BEDLAM2.0 increases diversity and realism of body shape, motions, clothing, hair, and 3D environments. Additionally, it adds shoes, which were missing in BEDLAM. BEDLAM has become a key resource for training 3D human pose and motion regressors today and we show that BEDLAM2.0 is significantly better, particularly for training methods that estimate humans in world coordinates. We compare state-of-the art methods trained on BEDLAM and BEDLAM2.0, and find that BEDLAM2.0 significantly improves accuracy over BEDLAM.

Existing methods face a fundamental dilemma. On one hand, projecting all domains into a single unified visual space leads to inter-domain interference and semantic distortion, as large shifts may vary with not only visual appearance but also underlying semantics. On the other hand, isolating domain-specific parameters causes knowledge fragmentation, creating \"knowledge islands\" that hamper knowledge reuse and exacerbate forgetting. To address this issue, we propose LAVA (Language-Anchored Visual Alignment), a novel DIL framework that replaces direct feature alignment with relative alignment driven by a text-based reference anchor. LAVA guides the visual representations of each incoming domain to preserve a consistent relative geometry, which is defined by mirroring the pairwise semantic similarities between the class names.

Traditional methods for locating landmarks are time-consuming and require specialized knowledge and expertise. Current methods utilize superimposition and deep learning-based methods that employ automatic annotation of landmarks. However, these methods are not reliable due to insufficient large-scale validation studies. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework Cranio-ID: First, an automatic annotation of landmarks on 2D skulls (which are X-ray scans of faces) with their respective optical images using our trained YOLO-pose models. Second, cross-modal matching by formulating these landmarks into graph representations and then finding semantic correspondence between graphs of these two modalities using cross-attention and optimal transport framework. Our proposed framework is validated on the S2F and CUHK datasets (CUHK dataset resembles with S2F dataset). Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed framework, which demonstrates significant improvements in both reliability and accuracy, as well as its effectiveness in cross-domain skull-to-face and sketch-to-face matching in forensic science.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCranio-ID\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6cd5\u533b\u9885\u9762\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9885\u9aa8\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5339\u914d\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684YOLO-pose\u6a21\u578b\u57282D\u9885\u9aa8\u56fe\u50cf\uff08\u5982\u9762\u90e8X\u5149\u7247\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\u6784\u5efa\u6210\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u6a21\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u5e94\u5339\u914d\u3002\u5728S2F\u548cCUHK\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u57df\u9885\u9aa8-\u4eba\u8138\u3001\u8349\u56fe-\u4eba\u8138\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9885\u9aa8\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u50cf\u7d20\u6216\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u6cd5\u533b\u9885\u9762\u8bc6\u522b\u53ca\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCranio-ID\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a(1) \u4f7f\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684YOLO-pose\u6a21\u578b\u5bf92D\u9885\u9aa8\u56fe\u50cf\uff08X\u5149\u7247\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u5149\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\u6807\u6ce8\uff1b(2) \u5c06\u6807\u6ce8\u7ed3\u679c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u5e94\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728S2F\u548cCUHK\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cCranio-ID\u5728\u9885\u9aa8-\u4eba\u8138\u548c\u8349\u56fe-\u4eba\u8138\u5339\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Cranio-ID\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5728\u6cd5\u533b\u9885\u9762\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u7684\u751f\u7269\u7279\u5f81\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

To explore the ecological advantages of such staged \"visual diets\", we train self-supervised learning (SSL) models on object-centric videos under constraints that simulate infant vision: grayscale-to-color (C), blur-to-sharp (A), and preserved temporal continuity (T)-collectively termed CATDiet. For evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark across ten datasets, covering clean and corrupted image recognition, texture-shape cue conflict tests, silhouette recognition, depth-order classification, and the visual cliff paradigm. All CATDiet variants demonstrate enhanced robustness in object recognition, despite being trained solely on object-centric videos. Remarkably, models also exhibit biologically aligned developmental patterns, including neural plasticity changes mirroring synaptic density in macaque V1 and behaviors resembling infants' visual cliff responses. Building on these insights, CombDiet initializes SSL with CATDiet before standard training while preserving temporal continuity. Trained on object-centric or head-mounted infant videos, CombDiet outperforms standard SSL on both in-domain and out-of-domain object recognition and depth perception. Together, these results suggest that the developmental progression of early infant visual experience offers a powerful reverse-engineering framework for understanding the emergence of robust visual intelligence in machines.

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, they typically process videos largely in a single-pass manner with limited support for evidence revisit and iterative refinement. While recently emerging agent-based methods enable long-horizon reasoning, they either depend heavily on expensive proprietary models or require extensive agentic RL training. To overcome these limitations, we propose Agentic Video Intelligence (AVI), a flexible and training-free framework that can mirror human video comprehension through system-level design and optimization. AVI introduces three key innovations: (1) a human-inspired three-phase reasoning process (Retrieve-Perceive-Review) that ensures both sufficient global exploration and focused local analysis, (2) a structured video knowledge base organized through entity graphs, along with multi-granularity integrated tools, constituting the agent's interaction environment, and (3) an open-source model ensemble combining reasoning LLMs with lightweight base CV models and VLM, eliminating dependence on proprietary APIs or RL training. Experiments on LVBench, VideoMME-Long, LongVideoBench, and Charades-STA demonstrate that AVI achieves competitive performance while offering superior interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAgentic Video Intelligence (AVI)\u7684\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08\u68c0\u7d22-\u611f\u77e5-\u56de\u987e\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u4e0e\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u6b21\u904d\u5386\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bc1\u636e\u56de\u6eaf\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u5927\u91cf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u63a8\u5e7f\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "AVI\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08Retrieve-Perceive-Review\uff09\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u4f53\u56fe\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u5de5\u5177\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u63a8\u7406\u578bLLM\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u57fa\u7840CV\u6a21\u578b\u548cVLM\uff09\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u5bf9\u4e13\u6709API\u6216\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u5728LVBench\u3001VideoMME-Long\u3001LongVideoBench\u548cCharades-STA\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cAVI\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AVI\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The task is particularly challenging for smallholder farms, where accurate delineation requires the use of high resolution (HR) imagery which are available only at low revisit frequencies (e.g., annually). To support more frequent (sub-) seasonal monitoring, HR images could be combined as references (ref) with low resolution (LR) images -- having higher revisit frequency (e.g., weekly) -- using reference-based super-resolution (Ref-SR) methods. However, current Ref-SR methods optimize perceptual quality and smooth over crucial features needed for downstream tasks, and are unable to meet the large scale-factor requirements for this task. Further, previous two-step approaches of SR followed by segmentation do not effectively utilize diverse satellite sources as inputs. We address these problems through a new approach, $\\textbf{SEED-SR}$, which uses a combination of conditional latent diffusion models and large-scale multi-spectral, multi-source geo-spatial foundation models. Our key innovation is to bypass the explicit SR task in the pixel space and instead perform SR in a segmentation-aware latent space. This unique approach enables us to generate segmentation maps at an unprecedented 20$\\times$ scale factor, and rigorous experiments on two large, real datasets demonstrate up to $\\textbf{25.5}$ and $\\textbf{12.9}$ relative improvement in instance and semantic segmentation metrics respectively over approaches based on state-of-the-art Ref-SR methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSEED-SR\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5206\u5272\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5c0f\u519c\u6237\u519c\u7530\u8fb9\u754c\u63d0\u53d6\u4e2d\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u83b7\u53d6\u9891\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u3001\u591a\u6e90\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8df3\u8fc7\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8620\u500d\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5c3a\u5ea6\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u5927\u578b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u53c2\u8003\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e8625.5%\u548c12.9%\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u519c\u6237\u519c\u7530\u8fb9\u754c\u63d0\u53d6\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u83b7\u53d6\u9891\u7387\u4f4e\uff08\u5982\u6bcf\u5e74\u4e00\u6b21\uff09\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u76d1\u6d4b\u3002\u867d\u7136\u53ef\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u9ad8\u91cd\u8bbf\u9891\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u4f7f\u7528\u53c2\u8003\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u65f6\u4f1a\u6a21\u7cca\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u56e0\u5b50\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4e24\u6b65\u6cd5\uff08\u5148\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u518d\u5206\u5272\uff09\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u536b\u661f\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSEED-SR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6e90\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ece\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u5206\u5272\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u76f4\u63a5\u91cd\u5efa\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u5272\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u5927\u578b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cSEED-SR\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8620\u500d\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5c3a\u5ea6\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u534725.5%\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u534712.9%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SEED-SR\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5206\u5272\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u56e0\u5b50\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e3a\u519c\u4e1a\u9065\u611f\u4e2d\u7684\u9891\u7e41\u3001\u7cbe\u51c6\u519c\u7530\u8fb9\u754c\u63d0\u53d6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Existing methods predominantly utilize convolutional layers and attention mechanisms to explore task-level interactions. In this work, we introduce a novel decoder-based framework, Parameter Aware Mamba Model (PAMM), specifically designed for dense prediction in multi-task learning setting. Distinct from approaches that employ Transformers to model holistic task relationships, PAMM leverages the rich, scalable parameters of state space models to enhance task interconnectivity. It features dual state space parameter experts that integrate and set task-specific parameter priors, capturing the intrinsic properties of each task. This approach not only facilitates precise multi-task interactions but also allows for the global integration of task priors through the structured state space sequence model (S4).

To avoid cross-component interference, we design dedicated encoders for each decoupled component and adopt a shared 3D decoder to maintain spatiotemporal consistency during reconstruction.

However, this comes at the price of a deterioration in image quality due to the low dose of radiation used to reduce the risk of secondary cancer development. While some efficient methods have been proposed to enhance LDCT quality, many overestimate noise and perform excessive smoothing, leading to a loss of critical details. In this paper, we introduce D-PerceptCT, a novel architecture inspired by key principles of the Human Visual System (HVS) to enhance LDCT images. The objective is to guide the model to enhance or preserve perceptually relevant features, thereby providing radiologists with CT images where critical anatomical structures and fine pathological details are perceptu- ally visible. D-PerceptCT consists of two main blocks: 1) a Visual Dual-path Extractor (ViDex), which integrates semantic priors from a pretrained DINOv2 model with local spatial features, allowing the network to incorporate semantic-awareness during enhancement; (2) a Global-Local State-Space block that captures long-range information and multiscale features to preserve the important structures and fine details for diagnosis. In addition, we propose a novel deep perceptual loss, designated as the Deep Perceptual Relevancy Loss Function (DPRLF), which is inspired by human contrast sensitivity, to further emphasize perceptually important features.

Although automated methods for WMH segmentation have advanced, most provide only global lesion load and overlook their spatial distribution across distinct white matter regions. We propose a deep learning framework for robust WMH segmentation and localization, evaluated across public datasets and an independent Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our results show that the predicted lesion loads are in line with the reference WMH estimates, confirming the robustness to variations in lesion load, acquisition, and demographics. Beyond accurate segmentation, we quantify WMH load within anatomically defined regions and combine these measures with brain structure volumes to assess diagnostic value. Regional WMH volumes consistently outperform global lesion burden for disease classification, and integration with brain atrophy metrics further improves performance, reaching area under the curve (AUC) values up to 0.97. Several spatially distinct regions, particularly within anterior white matter tracts, are reproducibly associated with diagnostic status, indicating localized vulnerability in AD. These results highlight the added value of regional WMH quantification.

While integrating complementary information from various MRI sequences is a common practice, the frequent absence of one or more modalities in real-world clinical settings poses a significant challenge, severely compromising the performance and generalizability of deep learning-based segmentation models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Cross-Modal Compositional Self-Distillation (CCSD) framework that can flexibly handle arbitrary combinations of input modalities. CCSD adopts a shared-specific encoder-decoder architecture and incorporates two self-distillation strategies: (i) a hierarchical modality self-distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge across modality hierarchies to reduce semantic discrepancies, and (ii) a progressive modality combination distillation approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities by simulating gradual modality dropout during training. Extensive experiments on public brain tumor segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that CCSD achieves state-of-the-art performance across various missing-modality scenarios, with strong generalization and stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7ec4\u5408\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\uff08CCSD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001MRI\u4e2d\u4efb\u610f\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab-\u7279\u5b9a\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u4e00\u79cd\u6216\u591a\u79cdMRI\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u7075\u6d3b\u5e94\u5bf9\u4efb\u610f\u6a21\u6001\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5171\u4eab-\u7279\u5b9a\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u6a21\u6001\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u673a\u5236\uff08\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u5f02\uff09\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u6a21\u6001\u7ec4\u5408\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u6a21\u62df\u6a21\u6001\u9010\u6b65\u7f3a\u5931\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCCSD\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CCSD\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001MRI\u4e2d\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

An SDF is an implicit function that can query signed distances at specific coordinates for recovering a 3D surface. Although implicit functions work well on a single shape or scene, they pose obstacles when analyzing multiple SDFs with high-fidelity geometry details, due to the limited information encoded in the latent space for SDFs and the loss of geometry details. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce a method to represent multiple SDFs in a common space, aiming to recover more high-fidelity geometry details with more compact latent representations. Our key idea is to take full advantage of the benefits of generalization-based and overfitting-based learning strategies, which manage to preserve high-fidelity geometry details with compact latent codes.

We follow the trend of dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting based methods, and address several significant challenges. To model complex hand-object interaction with mutual occlusion and edge blur, we present interaction-aware hand-object Gaussians with newly introduced optimizable parameters aiming to adopt piecewise linear hypothesis for clearer structural representation. Moreover, considering the complementarity and tightness of hand shape and object shape during interaction dynamics, we incorporate hand information into object deformation field, constructing interaction-aware dynamic fields to model flexible motions. To further address difficulties in the optimization process, we propose a progressive strategy that handles dynamic regions and static background step by step. Correspondingly, explicit regularizations are designed to stabilize the hand-object representations for smooth motion transition, physical interaction reality, and coherent lighting. Experiments show that our approach surpasses existing dynamic 3D-GS-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing dynamic hand-object interaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u7269\u4f53\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u52a8\u60013D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u624b-\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u5916\u89c2\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\u77e5\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u624b\u5f62\u4e0e\u7269\u4f53\u5f62\u53d8\u573a\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u906e\u6321\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u624b-\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u7269\u4f53\u5148\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u624b-\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u5916\u89c2\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u76f8\u4e92\u906e\u6321\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5f62\u53d8\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u624b-\u7269\u4f53\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u6bb5\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b\u5c06\u624b\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5165\u7269\u4f53\u5f62\u53d8\u573a\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u573a\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u663e\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u624b-\u7269\u4f53\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fd0\u52a8\u8fc7\u6e21\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u624b-\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u60013D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u5916\u89c2\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\u77e5\u52a8\u60013D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65e0\u5148\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u624b-\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

To bridge this gap, we present OmniZip, a training-free, audio-guided audio-visual token-compression framework that optimizes multimodal token representation and accelerates inference. Specifically, OmniZip first identifies salient audio tokens, then computes an audio retention score for each time group to capture information density, thereby dynamically guiding video token pruning and preserving cues from audio anchors enhanced by cross-modal similarity.

Extensive experiments on the data from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study show that our model outperforms the baseline models in regression generalization and robustness. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of both cross-attention fusion and the customized loss function. Experimental results show that the integration of multimodal data via cross-attention outperforms naive feature concatenation without cross-attention, reducing MSE by 16.7%, MAE by 6.03%, and increasing the R2 score by 16.4%, highlighting the effectiveness of the approach for femoral neck BMD estimation.

Most predictive algorithms that infer ST directly from histology treat each section independently and ignore 3D structure, while existing 3D-aware approaches are not generative and do not scale well. We present Holographic Tissue Expression Inpainting and Analysis (HoloTea), a 3D-aware flow-matching framework that imputes spot-level gene expression from H&E while explicitly using information from adjacent sections. Our key idea is to retrieve morphologically corresponding spots on neighboring slides in a shared feature space and fuse this cross section context into a lightweight ControlNet, allowing conditioning to follow anatomical continuity. To better capture the count nature of the data, we introduce a 3D-consistent prior for flow matching that combines a learned zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) prior with a spatial-empirical prior constructed from neighboring sections. A global attention block introduces 3D H&E scaling linearly with the number of spots in the slide, enabling training and inference on large 3D ST datasets. Across three spatial transcriptomics datasets spanning different tissue types and resolutions, HoloTea consistently improves 3D expression accuracy and generalization compared to 2D and 3D baselines.

Project page: https://miya-oi.github.io/SparseSurf-project", "summary": "Recent advances in optimizing Gaussian Splatting for scene geometry have enabled efficient reconstruction of detailed surfaces from images. However, when input views are sparse, such optimization is prone to overfitting, leading to suboptimal reconstruction quality. Existing approaches address this challenge by employing flattened Gaussian primitives to better fit surface geometry, combined with depth regularization to alleviate geometric ambiguities under limited viewpoints. Nevertheless, the increased anisotropy inherent in flattened Gaussians exacerbates overfitting in sparse-view scenarios, hindering accurate surface fitting and degrading novel view synthesis performance. In this paper, we propose \\net{}, a method that reconstructs more accurate and detailed surfaces while preserving high-quality novel view rendering. Our key insight is to introduce Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment, which bridges rendering quality and geometry estimation, thereby jointly enhancing both surface reconstruction and view synthesis. In addition, we present a Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency that enforces multi-view geometric consistency by incorporating both training and unseen views, effectively mitigating overfitting caused by sparse supervision. Extensive experiments on the DTU, BlendedMVS, and Mip-NeRF360 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\net{}\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\u9635\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7acb\u4f53\u51e0\u4f55-\u7eb9\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u4f2a\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u672a\u89c1\u89c6\u89d2\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u7a00\u758f\u76d1\u7763\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002\u5728DTU\u3001BlendedMVS\u548cMip-NeRF360\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u5bb9\u6613\u56e0\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u91c7\u7528\u6241\u5e73\u5316\u9ad8\u65af\u539f\u578b\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6539\u5584\u51e0\u4f55\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u8868\u9762\u62df\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u6548\u679c\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u51e0\u4f55\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStereo Geometry-Texture Alignment\uff08\u7acb\u4f53\u51e0\u4f55-\u7eb9\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u4ee5\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency\uff08\u4f2a\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u672a\u89c1\u89c6\u89d2\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728DTU\u3001BlendedMVS\u548cMip-NeRF360\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\net{}\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55-\u7eb9\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u4f2a\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u66f4\u7ec6\u8282\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

We propose SLAM-AGS, a Slide-Label-Aware Multitask pretraining framework that jointly optimizes (i) a weakly supervised similarity objective on slide-negative patches and (ii) a self-supervised contrastive objective on slide-positive patches, yielding stronger performance on downstream tasks. To stabilize learning, we apply Adaptive Gradient Surgery to tackle conflicting task gradients and prevent model collapse. We integrate the pretrained encoder into an attention-based Multiple Instance Learning aggregator for bag-level prediction and attention-guided retrieval of the most abnormal instances in a bag. On a publicly available bone-marrow cytology dataset, with simulated witness rates from 10% down to 0.5%, SLAM-AGS improves bag-level F1-Score and Top 400 positive cell retrieval over other pretraining methods, with the largest gains at low witness rates, showing that resolving gradient interference enables stable pretraining and better performance on downstream tasks. To facilitate reproducibility, we share our complete implementation and evaluation framework as open source: https://github.com/Ace95/SLAM-AGS.", "AI": {"tldr": "SLAM-AGS \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u9aa8\u9ad3\u7ec6\u80de\u5b66\u4e2d\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u9633\u6027\u6837\u672c\u6781\u4f4e\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68af\u5ea6\u624b\u672f\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u9633\u6027\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u5f02\u5e38\u7ec6\u80de\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u590d\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ec6\u80de\u5b66\u4e2d\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4ee5\u53ca\u9633\u6027\u6837\u672c\uff08\u89c1\u8bc1\u7387\uff09\u6781\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSLAM-AGS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6ed1\u7247\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u6ed1\u7247\u6b63\u6837\u672c\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68af\u5ea6\u624b\u672f\u7f13\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u805a\u5408\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u888b\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u5e76\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f02\u5e38\u5b9e\u4f8b\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u9aa8\u9ad3\u7ec6\u80de\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u89c1\u8bc1\u7387\u4ece10%\u964d\u81f30.5%\u65f6\uff0cSLAM-AGS\u5728\u888b\u7ea7F1\u5206\u6570\u548c\u524d400\u4e2a\u9633\u6027\u7ec6\u80de\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u89c1\u8bc1\u7387\u4e0b\u4f18\u52bf\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u68af\u5ea6\u5e72\u6270\u7f13\u89e3\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u66f4\u4f18\u4e0b\u6e38\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "SLAM-AGS\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\u4e0e\u4f4e\u89c1\u8bc1\u7387\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u534f\u540c\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7ec6\u80de\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
