### [1] [PHANTOM: PHysical ANamorphic Threats Obstructing Connected Vehicle Mobility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19711)
*Md Nahid Hasan Shuvo,Moinul Hossain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHANTOM is a novel framework that uses anamorphic art to create perspective-dependent adversarial examples for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), exploiting vision-based DNNs and V2X communication. It operates in black-box settings, achieves over 90% attack success rate under optimal conditions, and maintains 60-80% effectiveness in degraded environments. The attack activates within 6-10 meters, leaving insufficient time for safe response, and causes network-wide disruption by propagating false emergency messages through V2X links, increasing Peak Age of Information by 68-89%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAVs are vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks that can compromise safety and efficiency. Existing attacks often lack realism or transferability across models. PHANTOM addresses these gaps by leveraging anamorphic art to generate natural-looking but misclassified adversarial examples that work across diverse object detectors and real-world conditions.

Method: PHANTOM uses anamorphic art techniques to design adversarial patches that appear normal to human observers but cause high-confidence misclassification by state-of-the-art object detectors. The framework operates in a black-box setting without requiring model access and demonstrates strong transferability across YOLOv5, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet. Evaluations were conducted in CARLA simulations under varying speeds, weather, and lighting, and co-simulations with SUMO-OMNeT++ assessed the impact on V2X communication.

Result: PHANTOM achieves over 90% attack success rate under optimal conditions and maintains 60-80% effectiveness in challenging environments. The attack activates within 6-10 meters of the target, reducing reaction time. False emergency messages propagate via V2X, increasing Peak Age of Information by 68-89%, severely degrading safety-critical communication.

Conclusion: PHANTOM reveals critical vulnerabilities in both perception and communication layers of CAV ecosystems. By exploiting geometric distortions through anamorphic art, it enables effective, realistic, and transferable physical adversarial attacks that can disrupt entire CAV networks, highlighting the urgent need for robust defenses.

Abstract: Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) rely on vision-based deep neural networks (DNNs) and low-latency (Vehicle-to-Everything) V2X communication to navigate safely and efficiently. Despite their advances, these systems remain vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce PHANTOM (PHysical ANamorphic Threats Obstructing connected vehicle Mobility), a novel framework for crafting and deploying perspective-dependent adversarial examples using \textit{anamorphic art}. PHANTOM exploits geometric distortions that appear natural to humans but are misclassified with high confidence by state-of-the-art object detectors. Unlike conventional attacks, PHANTOM operates in black-box settings without model access and demonstrates strong transferability across four diverse detector architectures (YOLOv5, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet). Comprehensive evaluation in CARLA across varying speeds, weather conditions, and lighting scenarios shows that PHANTOM achieves over 90\% attack success rate under optimal conditions and maintains 60-80\% effectiveness even in degraded environments. The attack activates within 6-10 meters of the target, providing insufficient time for safe maneuvering. Beyond individual vehicle deception, PHANTOM triggers network-wide disruption in CAV systems: SUMO-OMNeT++ co-simulation demonstrates that false emergency messages propagate through V2X links, increasing Peak Age of Information by 68-89\% and degrading safety-critical communication. These findings expose critical vulnerabilities in both perception and communication layers of CAV ecosystems.

### [2] [Learning to Refocus with Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19823)
*SaiKiran Tedla,Zhoutong Zhang,Xuaner Zhang,Shumian Xin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于视频扩散模型的后捕获重新对焦方法，仅需一张模糊图像即可生成感知上准确的焦点堆栈（以视频序列形式呈现），支持交互式重新对焦，并释放了一系列下游应用潜力。研究还发布了一个大规模、在真实手机环境下采集的焦点堆栈数据集，以推动该领域的发展。所提方法在感知质量和鲁棒性方面均优于现有技术，适用于复杂场景。代码与数据已公开。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动对焦系统常无法准确捕捉预期主体，且用户通常希望在拍摄后调整焦点。然而，现有的后处理对焦方法在真实场景中表现不佳，缺乏自然感和鲁棒性。因此，亟需一种能够生成高质量、真实感焦点变化的方法，以实现灵活的后期焦点编辑。

Method: 利用视频扩散模型，从单张模糊图像中生成一个包含多个聚焦层级的视频序列（即焦点堆栈）。该方法通过学习真实世界中的焦点变化模式，重建出自然过渡的清晰图像序列，支持用户交互式选择不同焦点位置。同时，结合大规模真实条件下的焦点堆栈数据集进行训练与评估。

Result: 所提方法在多种复杂真实场景下均表现出显著优于现有方法的感知质量与鲁棒性，能够生成逼真且连贯的焦点变化视频序列，有效支持后捕获重新对焦及后续应用。

Conclusion: 本工作为日常摄影中的焦点编辑提供了新范式，通过视频扩散模型实现了高质量、可交互的后捕获重新对焦，推动了智能摄影的发展。相关代码与数据已公开，有助于未来研究。

Abstract: Focus is a cornerstone of photography, yet autofocus systems often fail to capture the intended subject, and users frequently wish to adjust focus after capture. We introduce a novel method for realistic post-capture refocusing using video diffusion models. From a single defocused image, our approach generates a perceptually accurate focal stack, represented as a video sequence, enabling interactive refocusing and unlocking a range of downstream applications. We release a large-scale focal stack dataset acquired under diverse real-world smartphone conditions to support this work and future research. Our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in both perceptual quality and robustness across challenging scenarios, paving the way for more advanced focus-editing capabilities in everyday photography.

### [3] [RANSAC Scoring Functions: Analysis and Reality Check](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19850)
*A. Shekhovtsov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了在RANSAC中为候选几何模型分配评分（拟合质量）的问题，提出基于球面噪声的几何误差扩展，并在鲁棒设置下通过混合均匀分布异常值，统一了似然估计与鲁棒M-估计器及其局部优化方法。分析发现MAGSAC++的推导不遵循严谨原则，其得分函数在数值上等价于一个简单的高斯-均匀似然模型。此外，提出一种实验评估方法，结果表明所有评分函数表现相同，包括使用学习的内点分布，MAGSAC++并未显示出对阈值超参数的更低敏感性或更优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评分函数在理论和实践上的有效性缺乏系统验证，尤其是先进方法如MAGSAC++的推导基础存疑，且其实际优势未被充分证实，因此需要重新审视评分函数的设计原则与评估标准。

Method: 通过概率建模扩展几何误差至球面噪声；构建混合模型以统一似然与鲁棒估计；对MAGSAC++进行理论溯源与数值等价性分析；设计基于大验证集或小随机验证集的期望评估方法，进行多评分函数对比实验。

Result: MAGSAC++的得分函数在数值上等价于基础的高斯-均匀似然模型，其性能与其他简单评分函数无显著差异；所有评分函数在实验中表现一致，说明当前基准不足以区分其优劣，且阈值选择对性能影响不大。

Conclusion: 当前最先进的评分函数（如MAGSAC++）并无理论或实证上的显著优势，应重新审视其设计原理与评估框架，未来研究需建立更严格、可复现的评价体系，以推动鲁棒几何拟合方法的发展。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of assigning a score (a quality of fit) to candidate geometric models -- one of the key components of RANSAC for robust geometric fitting. In a non-robust setting, the ``gold standard'' scoring function, known as the geometric error, follows from a probabilistic model with Gaussian noises. We extend it to spherical noises. In a robust setting, we consider a mixture with uniformly distributed outliers and show that a threshold-based parameterization leads to a unified view of likelihood-based and robust M-estimators and associated local optimization schemes.
  Next we analyze MAGSAC++ which stands out for two reasons. First, it achieves the best results according to existing benchmarks. Second, it makes quite different modeling assumptions and derivation steps. We discovered, however that the derivation does not correspond to sound principles and the resulting score function is in fact numerically equivalent to a simple Gaussian-uniform likelihood, a basic model within the proposed framework.
  Finally, we propose an experimental methodology for evaluating scoring functions: assuming either a large validation set, or a small random validation set in expectation. We find that all scoring functions, including using a learned inlier distribution, perform identically. In particular, MAGSAC++ score is found to be neither better performing than simple contenders nor less sensitive to the choice of the threshold hyperparameter.
  Our theoretical and experimental analysis thus comprehensively revisit the state-of-the-art, which is critical for any future research seeking to improve the methods or apply them to other robust fitting problems.

### [4] [HyGE-Occ: Hybrid View-Transformation with 3D Gaussian and Edge Priors for 3D Panoptic Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19871)
*Jong Wook Kim,Wonseok Roh,Ha Dam Baek,Pilhyeon Lee,Jonghyun Choi,Sangpil Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyGE-Occ提出一种新颖的3D全景占据预测框架，通过结合3D高斯和边缘先验的混合视图转换分支，提升几何一致性和边界感知能力。该方法融合连续高斯深度表示与离散深度桶格式，生成具有更好几何一致性和结构连贯性的鸟瞰图（BEV）特征，并利用从BEV特征中提取的边缘图作为辅助信息以学习边缘线索，在Occ3D-nuScenes数据集上显著优于现有方法，展现出更强的3D几何推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D全景占据预测方法在保持精确几何形状和捕捉3D实例的空间范围方面存在困难，导致分割不准确，尤其在复杂环境中表现不佳。因此需要更精确的几何推理与空间一致性表达方式。

Method: 提出HyGE-Occ框架，采用混合视图转换分支，融合连续高斯深度表示与离散深度桶表示，生成更具几何一致性的BEV特征；同时从BEV特征中提取边缘图，作为辅助信息以增强边界感知能力。

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，HyGE-Occ显著优于现有方法，特别是在几何精度和实例分离方面表现优异，验证了其在复杂场景下实现更鲁棒3D理解的能力。

Conclusion: HyGE-Occ通过引入高斯与边缘先验的混合视图转换机制，有效提升了3D全景占据预测中的几何一致性与边界感知能力，为构建精确、连贯的3D场景地图提供了新思路。

Abstract: 3D Panoptic Occupancy Prediction aims to reconstruct a dense volumetric scene map by predicting the semantic class and instance identity of every occupied region in 3D space. Achieving such fine-grained 3D understanding requires precise geometric reasoning and spatially consistent scene representation across complex environments. However, existing approaches often struggle to maintain precise geometry and capture the precise spatial range of 3D instances critical for robust panoptic separation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce HyGE-Occ, a novel framework that leverages a hybrid view-transformation branch with 3D Gaussian and edge priors to enhance both geometric consistency and boundary awareness in 3D panoptic occupancy prediction. HyGE-Occ employs a hybrid view-transformation branch that fuses a continuous Gaussian-based depth representation with a discretized depth-bin formulation, producing BEV features with improved geometric consistency and structural coherence. In parallel, we extract edge maps from BEV features and use them as auxiliary information to learn edge cues. In our extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset, HyGE-Occ outperforms existing work, demonstrating superior 3D geometric reasoning.

### [5] [Widget2Code: From Visual Widgets to UI Code via Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19918)
*Houston H. Zhang,Tao Zhang,Baoze Lin,Yuanqi Xue,Yincheng Zhu,Huan Liu,Li Gu,Linfeng Ye,Ziqiang Wang,Xinxin Zuo,Yang Wang,Yuanhao Yu,Zhixiang Chi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出Widget2Code任务，针对应用组件的图像到代码生成，构建了首个仅基于图像的基准测试集，并设计了细粒度评估指标。尽管通用多模态大模型表现优于专用方法，但生成结果仍存在不可靠和视觉不一致问题。为此，作者提出WidgetFactory系统，结合遵循界面设计原则的感知理解模块与结构化代码生成框架，引入可重用可视化组件和图标检索机制，并开发了跨平台的WidgetDSL及编译器，支持多种前端实现（如React、HTML/CSS），同时通过自适应渲染优化空间紧凑性，显著提升视觉保真度，为未来研究奠定坚实基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UI2Code研究主要集中在网页和移动界面，而应用组件（widgets）因其紧凑、上下文无关、布局密集且受空间限制的特点，缺乏有效的生成方法。此外，组件设计通常为专有资源，难以获取对应的标记语言，导致数据稀缺。因此亟需专门针对widget的生成框架与评估体系。

Method: 提出WidgetFactory系统：1）在感知层面，依据组件设计原则，通过原子组件组合构建完整布局，集成图标检索与可复用可视化模块；2）在系统层面，设计框架无关的领域特定语言WidgetDSL，配合编译器将DSL转换为多种前端实现（如React、HTML/CSS）；3）引入自适应渲染模块，动态调整空间布局以满足紧凑性要求。

Result: 所提方法在图像到代码生成任务中显著提升了视觉保真度与一致性，生成代码更符合实际组件设计规范。实验表明，尽管通用多模态大模型表现较好，但仍存在可靠性不足的问题；而本方法通过联合优化感知理解与结构生成，构建了一个高效、可扩展且高保真的基线系统。

Conclusion: 该研究首次系统地定义并推动了Widget2Code任务的发展，提出了一个兼具感知建模与结构生成能力的统一基础设施WidgetFactory，为后续在紧凑型微界面生成方向的研究提供了重要参考与技术路径。

Abstract: User interface to code (UI2Code) aims to generate executable code that can faithfully reconstruct a given input UI. Prior work focuses largely on web pages and mobile screens, leaving app widgets underexplored. Unlike web or mobile UIs with rich hierarchical context, widgets are compact, context-free micro-interfaces that summarize key information through dense layouts and iconography under strict spatial constraints. Moreover, while (image, code) pairs are widely available for web or mobile UIs, widget designs are proprietary and lack accessible markup. We formalize this setting as the Widget-to-Code (Widget2Code) and introduce an image-only widget benchmark with fine-grained, multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. Benchmarking shows that although generalized multimodal large language models (MLLMs) outperform specialized UI2Code methods, they still produce unreliable and visually inconsistent code. To address these limitations, we develop a baseline that jointly advances perceptual understanding and structured code generation. At the perceptual level, we follow widget design principles to assemble atomic components into complete layouts, equipped with icon retrieval and reusable visualization modules. At the system level, we design an end-to-end infrastructure, WidgetFactory, which includes a framework-agnostic widget-tailored domain-specific language (WidgetDSL) and a compiler that translates it into multiple front-end implementations (e.g., React, HTML/CSS). An adaptive rendering module further refines spatial dimensions to satisfy compactness constraints. Together, these contributions substantially enhance visual fidelity, establishing a strong baseline and unified infrastructure for future Widget2Code research.

### [6] [Unified Brain Surface and Volume Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19928)
*S. Mazdak Abulnaga,Andrew Hoopes,Malte Hoffmann,Robin Magnet,Maks Ovsjanikov,Lilla Zöllei,John Guttag,Bruce Fischl,Adrian Dalca*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeurAlign is a deep learning framework that jointly registers 3D brain MRI scans by aligning both cortical and subcortical regions through a unified volume-and-surface representation. It uses spherical coordinate space to bridge surface and volume anatomy, ensuring geometric coherence and anatomical accuracy. The method outperforms traditional and state-of-the-art approaches in registration accuracy (up to 7-point Dice improvement), maintains smooth deformation fields, and is significantly faster and easier to use—requiring only an MRI scan as input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional brain MRI registration methods treat volumetric and surface-based alignment separately, leading to inconsistencies that hinder cross-subject neuroscientific analysis. There is a need for a unified approach that ensures anatomically accurate and geometrically coherent alignment between cortical surfaces and brain volumes.

Method: NeurAlign employs a deep learning framework that integrates spherical coordinate space to unify volumetric and surface-based representations. This intermediate space enables consistent alignment of both cortical and subcortical structures during training and inference, ensuring geometric coherence across domains.

Result: NeurAlign achieves superior registration accuracy compared to classical and machine learning-based methods, with up to 7-point improvement in Dice score. It also produces regular deformation fields, operates orders of magnitude faster than standard methods, and requires no additional inputs beyond the MRI scan.

Conclusion: NeurAlign sets a new benchmark for joint cortical and subcortical brain MRI registration by combining high accuracy, computational efficiency, and ease of use, making it ideal for large-scale neuroimaging studies.

Abstract: Accurate registration of brain MRI scans is fundamental for cross-subject analysis in neuroscientific studies. This involves aligning both the cortical surface of the brain and the interior volume. Traditional methods treat volumetric and surface-based registration separately, which often leads to inconsistencies that limit downstream analyses. We propose a deep learning framework, NeurAlign, that registers $3$D brain MRI images by jointly aligning both cortical and subcortical regions through a unified volume-and-surface-based representation. Our approach leverages an intermediate spherical coordinate space to bridge anatomical surface topology with volumetric anatomy, enabling consistent and anatomically accurate alignment. By integrating spherical registration into the learning, our method ensures geometric coherence between volume and surface domains. In a series of experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, our method consistently outperforms both classical and machine learning-based registration methods -- improving the Dice score by up to 7 points while maintaining regular deformation fields. Additionally, it is orders of magnitude faster than the standard method for this task, and is simpler to use because it requires no additional inputs beyond an MRI scan. With its superior accuracy, fast inference, and ease of use, NeurAlign sets a new standard for joint cortical and subcortical registration.

### [7] [Block-Recurrent Dynamics in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19941)
*Mozes Jacobs,Thomas Fel,Richard Hakim,Alessandra Brondetta,Demba Ba,T. Andy Keller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出块循环假设（BRH），认为训练好的视觉变压器（ViT）具有块循环深度结构，即原始L个块的计算可由少量（k≪L）不同块的重复应用准确重构。通过训练块循环替代模型Raptor，作者在小规模实验中验证了这一假设，并在等计算成本下实现了DINOv2 ImageNet-1k线性探测96%的准确率，证明了该结构的存在性。进一步地，基于此假设发展出动态可解释性框架，揭示了类别依赖的角基底收敛、令牌特异性动力学及后期深度低秩更新等现象，表明ViT深层存在紧凑的循环程序，支持其通过规范的动力系统方法进行分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对视觉变压器（ViT）深度计算机制的系统性理解，尽管其架构暗示了动态结构，但尚无统一框架将深度视为可刻画的演化过程。因此亟需建立一种能解释ViT深度计算本质的理论框架。

Method: 提出块循环假设（BRH），通过分析跨层表示相似性矩阵识别连续阶段；构建块循环替代模型Raptor，训练并评估其在保持性能的同时减少块数量的能力；采用动力系统视角分析模型在深度中的演化行为，包括方向收敛、令牌动态与更新秩的变化。

Result: 在小规模实验中，随机深度和训练促进循环结构形成，并提升对Raptor模型的拟合能力；成功训练出仅用2个块即可恢复DINOv2 ImageNet-1k 96%线性探测准确率的Raptor模型，证明了BRH的实证可行性；发现类间方向收敛、令牌特异性动态及晚期低秩更新等规律，支持紧凑循环程序的存在。

Conclusion: 视觉变压器在深度方向上表现出一种紧凑的块循环计算程序，这构成了一种低复杂度的规范解，使得模型可通过动力系统理论进行系统性分析，为理解其内在工作机制提供了新范式。

Abstract: As Vision Transformers (ViTs) become standard vision backbones, a mechanistic account of their computational phenomenology is essential. Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent computational cost. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis.

### [8] [SE360: Semantic Edit in 360$^\circ$ Panoramas via Hierarchical Data Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19943)
*Haoyi Zhong,Fang-Lue Zhang,Andrew Chalmers,Taehyun Rhee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SE360框架，用于360°全景图中多条件引导的对象编辑。通过自动生成数据并结合视觉-语言模型和自适应投影调整，实现对象及其物理上下文的完整分割。采用两阶段数据优化策略提升真实感并减少过拟合。基于构建的数据集训练了基于Transformer的扩散模型，支持文本、掩码或参考图像引导的灵活编辑。实验表明该方法在视觉质量和语义准确性上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在360°全景图的等距圆柱投影（ERP）和透视视图中常产生不合理的编辑结果，缺乏对物体及其物理上下文的整体理解，且依赖大量人工标注数据。因此需要一种无需人工干预、能生成语义和几何一致数据的新方法来提升全景图编辑质量。

Method: 提出一种从粗到细的自主数据生成管道，利用视觉-语言模型（VLM）与自适应投影调整进行分层分析，确保对象及其上下文的完整分割；设计两阶段数据精炼策略以增强数据真实性和防止模型过拟合；基于生成的数据集训练一个基于Transformer的扩散模型，支持文本、掩码或参考图像引导的多条件编辑。

Result: 所提方法在360°全景图编辑任务中显著优于现有方法，在视觉质量与语义准确性方面均表现出色，生成结果更自然、合理，且具有更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SE360成功实现了无需人工干预的高质量360°全景图对象编辑，其自动生成的数据与高效的扩散模型架构为未来全景内容创作提供了新范式。

Abstract: While instruction-based image editing is emerging, extending it to 360$^\circ$ panoramas introduces additional challenges. Existing methods often produce implausible results in both equirectangular projections (ERP) and perspective views. To address these limitations, we propose SE360, a novel framework for multi-condition guided object editing in 360$^\circ$ panoramas. At its core is a novel coarse-to-fine autonomous data generation pipeline without manual intervention. This pipeline leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and adaptive projection adjustment for hierarchical analysis, ensuring the holistic segmentation of objects and their physical context. The resulting data pairs are both semantically meaningful and geometrically consistent, even when sourced from unlabeled panoramas. Furthermore, we introduce a cost-effective, two-stage data refinement strategy to improve data realism and mitigate model overfitting to erase artifacts. Based on the constructed dataset, we train a Transformer-based diffusion model to allow flexible object editing guided by text, mask, or reference image in 360$^\circ$ panoramas. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and semantic accuracy.

Method: 提出一种模型无关的评估框架，利用浅层读出机制从VidFMs的特征中估计多种3D属性（如深度、空间关系、几何结构等），从而量化其3D意识水平。

Result: 结果显示，尽管未接受3D数据训练，当前最先进的视频生成模型已具备较强的3D理解能力，部分性能甚至超过专为3D任务设计的大型专家模型。同时，该框架成功实现了对主流VidFMs的3D基准测试。

Conclusion: 大规模视频数据预训练可能隐含地激发了模型对3D结构的理解能力，表明视频基础模型在迈向通用3D认知方面具有巨大潜力。这一发现为未来构建高效、可扩展的3D视觉系统提供了新的思路与实证支持。

Abstract: Videos are continuous 2D projections of 3D worlds. After training on large video data, will global 3D understanding naturally emerge? We study this by quantifying the 3D understanding of existing Video Foundation Models (VidFMs) pretrained on vast video data. We propose the first model-agnostic framework that measures the 3D awareness of various VidFMs by estimating multiple 3D properties from their features via shallow read-outs. Our study presents meaningful findings regarding the 3D awareness of VidFMs on multiple axes. In particular, we show that state-of-the-art video generation models exhibit a strong understanding of 3D objects and scenes, despite not being trained on any 3D data. Such understanding can even surpass that of large expert models specifically trained for 3D tasks. Our findings, together with the 3D benchmarking of major VidFMs, provide valuable observations for building scalable 3D models.

TL;DR: HistoWAS is a computational framework that links tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes by integrating 30 spatial and topological features from GIS with mass univariate regression, applied to kidney WSIs from the KPMP study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of tools to measure spatial interactions of tissue structures and their association with clinical outcomes limits the clinical relevance of histopathological analysis in high-throughput WSI studies.

Method: HistoWAS combines a feature space with 30 GIS-inspired spatial/topological features and an association study engine modeled after PheWAS, using mass univariate regression with statistical correction.

Result: Applied to 385 PAS-stained WSIs from 206 KPMP participants, HistoWAS successfully analyzed 102 features (72 conventional + 30 spatial), demonstrating feasibility and potential for biomarker discovery.

Conclusion: HistoWAS enables deeper exploration of tissue micro-architecture in relation to clinical outcomes, offering a powerful tool for precision medicine through spatial histology analysis.

Abstract: High-throughput "pathomic" analysis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) offers new opportunities to study tissue characteristics and for biomarker discovery. However, the clinical relevance of the tissue characteristics at the micro- and macro-environment level is limited by the lack of tools that facilitate the measurement of the spatial interaction of individual structure characteristics and their association with clinical parameters. To address these challenges, we introduce HistoWAS (Histology-Wide Association Study), a computational framework designed to link tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes. Specifically, HistoWAS implements (1) a feature space that augments conventional metrics with 30 topological and spatial features, adapted from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) point pattern analysis, to quantify tissue micro-architecture; and (2) an association study engine, inspired by Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS), that performs mass univariate regression for each feature with statistical correction. As a proof of concept, we applied HistoWAS to analyze a total of 102 features (72 conventional object-level features and our 30 spatial features) using 385 PAS-stained WSIs from 206 participants in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP). The code and data have been released to https://github.com/hrlblab/histoWAS.

*Peng Gao,Ke Li,Di Wang,Yongshan Zhu,Yiming Zhang,Xuemei Luo,Yifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DDTM提出了一种双分支弱监督框架，通过扩散模型细化局部语义，通过Transformer保持全局上下文一致性，结合伪标签置信度评估模块降低跨分辨率噪声，显著提升跨分辨率地表覆盖映射性能，在Chesapeake Bay基准上达到66.52% mIoU，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨分辨率地表覆盖映射中因分辨率差异导致的细粒度空间结构对齐困难和噪声监督问题，现有弱监督方法难以有效处理细粒度与粗标签之间的不匹配。

Method: 采用双分支架构：一为基于扩散模型的分支，用于在粗标签监督下逐步优化细尺度局部语义；另一为基于Transformer的分支，用于建模长距离空间上下文一致性；引入伪标签置信度评估模块，筛选可靠监督信号以减少噪声影响。

Result: 在Chesapeake Bay数据集上取得66.52% mIoU，显著超越已有弱监督方法，验证了该框架的有效性与先进性。

Conclusion: DDTM通过解耦局部语义细化与全局上下文推理，有效缓解了跨分辨率监督中的噪声与不一致性问题，为弱监督地表覆盖映射提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-resolution land cover mapping aims to produce high-resolution semantic predictions from coarse or low-resolution supervision, yet the severe resolution mismatch makes effective learning highly challenging. Existing weakly supervised approaches often struggle to align fine-grained spatial structures with coarse labels, leading to noisy supervision and degraded mapping accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose DDTM, a dual-branch weakly supervised framework that explicitly decouples local semantic refinement from global contextual reasoning. Specifically, DDTM introduces a diffusion-based branch to progressively refine fine-scale local semantics under coarse supervision, while a transformer-based branch enforces long-range contextual consistency across large spatial extents. In addition, we design a pseudo-label confidence evaluation module to mitigate noise induced by cross-resolution inconsistencies and to selectively exploit reliable supervisory signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDTM establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Chesapeake Bay benchmark, achieving 66.52\% mIoU and substantially outperforming prior weakly supervised methods.

Abstract: Automated pavement defect detection often struggles to generalize across diverse real-world conditions due to the lack of standardized datasets. Existing datasets differ in annotation styles, distress type definitions, and formats, limiting their integration for unified training. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark dataset that consolidates multiple publicly available sources into a standardized collection of 52747 images from seven countries, with 135277 bounding box annotations covering 13 distinct distress types. The dataset captures broad real-world variation in image quality, resolution, viewing angles, and weather conditions, offering a unique resource for consistent training and evaluation. Its effectiveness was demonstrated through benchmarking with state-of-the-art object detection models including YOLOv8-YOLOv12, Faster R-CNN, and DETR, which achieved competitive performance across diverse scenarios. By standardizing class definitions and annotation formats, this dataset provides the first globally representative benchmark for pavement defect detection and enables fair comparison of models, including zero-shot transfer to new environments.

Abstract: Effectively grounding complex language to pixels in remote sensing (RS) images is a critical challenge for applications like disaster response and environmental monitoring. Current models can parse simple, single-target commands but fail when presented with complex geospatial scenarios, e.g., segmenting objects at various granularities, executing multi-target instructions, and interpreting implicit user intent. To drive progress against these failures, we present LaSeRS, the first large-scale dataset built for comprehensive training and evaluation across four critical dimensions of language-guided segmentation: hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning requirements, and linguistic variability. By capturing these dimensions, LaSeRS moves beyond simple commands, providing a benchmark for complex geospatial reasoning. This addresses a critical gap: existing datasets oversimplify, leading to sensitivity-prone real-world models. We also propose SegEarth-R2, an MLLM architecture designed for comprehensive language-guided segmentation in RS, which directly confronts these challenges. The model's effectiveness stems from two key improvements: (1) a spatial attention supervision mechanism specifically handles the localization of small objects and their components, and (2) a flexible and efficient segmentation query mechanism that handles both single-target and multi-target scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our SegEarth-R2 achieves outstanding performance on LaSeRS and other benchmarks, establishing a powerful baseline for the next generation of geospatial segmentation. All data and code will be released at https://github.com/earth-insights/SegEarth-R2.

*Anthony Dontoh,Stephanie Ivey,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了在自然驾驶条件下，结合道路面向视图与驾驶员面向视图是否能提升分心驾驶检测的准确性。通过同步双摄像头记录的真实驾驶数据，对比了三种主流时空动作识别架构（SlowFast-R50、X3D-M、SlowOnly-R50）在单视图与双视图输入下的表现。结果显示，双视图输入对不同模型影响各异：单一路径的SlowOnly模型准确率提升9.8%，而双路径的SlowFast模型反而下降7.2%，源于表征冲突。研究强调，单纯增加视觉上下文不足以提升性能，需设计融合感知的架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分心驾驶检测模型多依赖驾驶员面向视图，忽视影响驾驶行为的重要环境上下文。为提升检测准确性，需探索道路面向视图的整合效果。

Method: 使用真实世界驾驶场景中的同步双摄像头视频数据，评估三种主流时空动作识别模型（SlowFast-R50、X3D-M、SlowOnly-R50）在仅驾驶员视图和双视图输入条件下的表现，系统比较其性能差异。

Result: 双视图输入对不同模型影响不一：SlowOnly-R50模型准确率提升9.8%，而SlowFast-R50模型准确率下降7.2%，表明多视图融合存在表征冲突，性能提升依赖于模型架构设计。

Conclusion: 简单添加环境视觉上下文并不能保证性能提升，除非模型架构具备融合感知能力。未来多模态驾驶员监控系统应优先考虑融合友好的设计。

Abstract: Despite increasing interest in computer vision-based distracted driving detection, most existing models rely exclusively on driver-facing views and overlook crucial environmental context that influences driving behavior. This study investigates whether incorporating road-facing views alongside driver-facing footage improves distraction detection accuracy in naturalistic driving conditions. Using synchronized dual-camera recordings from real-world driving, we benchmark three leading spatiotemporal action recognition architectures: SlowFast-R50, X3D-M, and SlowOnly-R50. Each model is evaluated under two input configurations: driver-only and stacked dual-view. Results show that while contextual inputs can improve detection in certain models, performance gains depend strongly on the underlying architecture. The single-pathway SlowOnly model achieved a 9.8 percent improvement with dual-view inputs, while the dual-pathway SlowFast model experienced a 7.2 percent drop in accuracy due to representational conflicts. These findings suggest that simply adding visual context is not sufficient and may lead to interference unless the architecture is specifically designed to support multi-view integration. This study presents one of the first systematic comparisons of single- and dual-view distraction detection models using naturalistic driving data and underscores the importance of fusion-aware design for future multimodal driver monitoring systems.

Conclusion: 超球几何能更高效地表示树状层次结构，H2em通过多层次学习目标与跨模态机制，在组合零样本学习中实现了更强的泛化能力与细粒度区分能力，为未来大规模视觉-语言理解任务提供了新范式。

Abstract: Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen state-object compositions by generalizing from a training set of their primitives (state and object). Current methods often overlook the rich hierarchical structures, such as the semantic hierarchy of primitives (e.g., apple fruit) and the conceptual hierarchy between primitives and compositions (e.g, sliced apple apple). A few recent efforts have shown effectiveness in modeling these hierarchies through loss regularization within Euclidean space. In this paper, we argue that they fail to scale to the large-scale taxonomies required for real-world CZSL: the space's polynomial volume growth in flat geometry cannot match the exponential structure, impairing generalization capacity. To this end, we propose H2em, a new framework that learns Hierarchical Hyperbolic EMbeddings for CZSL. H2em leverages the unique properties of hyperbolic geometry, a space naturally suited for embedding tree-like structures with low distortion. However, a naive hyperbolic mapping may suffer from hierarchical collapse and poor fine-grained discrimination. We further design two learning objectives to structure this space: a Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss that uses hyperbolic entailment cones to enforce the predefined hierarchies, and a Discriminative Alignment Loss with hard negative mining to establish a large geodesic distance between semantically similar compositions. Furthermore, we devise Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention to realize instance-aware cross-modal infusion within hyperbolic geometry. Extensive ablations on three benchmarks demonstrate that H2em establishes a new state-of-the-art in both closed-world and open-world scenarios. Our codes will be released.

Conclusion: VALLR-Pin通过融合视觉特征、语音上下文与语言模型能力，有效提升了中文唇语识别的鲁棒性与准确性，为复杂语言环境下的视觉语音识别提供了新范式。

Abstract: Visual Speech Recognition aims to transcribe spoken words from silent lip-motion videos. This task is particularly challenging for Mandarin, as visemes are highly ambiguous and homophones are prevalent. We propose VALLR-Pin, a novel two-stage framework that extends the recent VALLR architecture from English to Mandarin. First, a shared video encoder feeds into dual decoders, which jointly predict both Chinese character sequences and their standard Pinyin romanization. The multi-task learning of character and phonetic outputs fosters robust visual-semantic representations. During inference, the text decoder generates multiple candidate transcripts. We construct a prompt by concatenating the Pinyin output with these candidate Chinese sequences and feed it to a large language model to resolve ambiguities and refine the transcription. This provides the LLM with explicit phonetic context to correct homophone-induced errors. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM on synthetic noisy examples: we generate imperfect Pinyin-text pairs from intermediate VALLR-Pin checkpoints using the training data, creating instruction-response pairs for error correction. This endows the LLM with awareness of our model's specific error patterns. In summary, VALLR-Pin synergizes visual features with phonetic and linguistic context to improve Mandarin lip-reading performance.

Abstract: Real-world image captions often lack contextual depth, omitting crucial details such as event background, temporal cues, outcomes, and named entities that are not visually discernible. This gap limits the effectiveness of image understanding in domains like journalism, education, and digital archives, where richer, more informative descriptions are essential. To address this, we propose a multimodal pipeline that augments visual input with external textual knowledge. Our system retrieves semantically similar images using BEIT-3 (Flickr30k-384 and COCO-384) and SigLIP So-384, reranks them using ORB and SIFT for geometric alignment, and extracts contextual information from related articles via semantic search. A fine-tuned Qwen3 model with QLoRA then integrates this context with base captions generated by Instruct BLIP (Vicuna-7B) to produce event-enriched, context-aware descriptions. Evaluated on the OpenEvents v1 dataset, our approach generates significantly more informative captions compared to traditional methods, showing strong potential for real-world applications requiring deeper visual-textual understanding

Abstract: Recent advances in learned image codecs have been extended from human perception toward machine perception. However, progressive image compression with fine granular scalability (FGS)-which enables decoding a single bitstream at multiple quality levels-remains unexplored for machine-oriented codecs. In this work, we propose a novel progressive learned image compression codec for machine perception, PICM-Net, based on trit-plane coding. By analyzing the difference between human- and machine-oriented rate-distortion priorities, we systematically examine the latent prioritization strategies in terms of machine-oriented codecs. To further enhance real-world adaptability, we design an adaptive decoding controller, which dynamically determines the necessary decoding level during inference time to maintain the desired confidence of downstream machine prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enables efficient and adaptive progressive transmission while maintaining high performance in the downstream classification task, establishing a new paradigm for machine-aware progressive image compression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注模型架构设计，而对激活函数与优化器组合如何影响实际应用场景中的模型行为缺乏充分分析，尤其在医疗导向的活动识别任务中，亟需明确关键组件的协同效应以提升系统可靠性与精度。

Method: 选取三种常见激活函数（ReLU、Sigmoid、Tanh）与四种优化算法（SGD、Adam、RMSprop、Adagrad），分别搭配BiLSTM和ConvLSTM两种递归深度学习架构，在六类医学相关活动（来自HMDB51和UCF101数据集）上进行系统性实验，评估不同组合下的分类性能。

Conclusion: 激活函数与优化器的组合对HAR系统性能有显著影响，ConvLSTM配合Adam或RMSprop是医疗场景下高效、稳定活动识别的理想选择，该研究为实际部署中的模型选型提供了实证依据。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in healthcare, surveillance, and innovative environments, where reliable action recognition supports timely decision-making and automation. Although deep learning-based HAR systems are widely adopted, the impact of Activation Functions (AFs) and Model Optimizers (MOs) on performance has not been sufficiently analyzed, particularly regarding how their combinations influence model behavior in practical scenarios. Most existing studies focus on architecture design, while the interaction between AF and MO choices remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we investigate the effect of three commonly used activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh) combined with four optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad) using two recurrent deep learning architectures, namely BiLSTM and ConvLSTM. Experiments are conducted on six medically relevant activity classes selected from the HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets, considering their suitability for healthcare-oriented HAR applications. Our experimental results show that ConvLSTM consistently outperforms BiLSTM across both datasets. ConvLSTM, combined with Adam or RMSprop, achieves an accuracy of up to 99.00%, demonstrating strong spatio-temporal learning capabilities and stable performance. While BiLSTM performs reasonably well on UCF101, with accuracy approaching 98.00%, its performance drops to approximately 60.00% on HMDB51, indicating limited robustness across datasets and weaker sensitivity to AF and MO variations. This study provides practical insights for optimizing HAR systems, particularly for real-world healthcare environments where fast and precise activity detection is critical.

Abstract: Generating realistic and diverse LiDAR point clouds is crucial for autonomous driving simulation. Although previous methods achieve LiDAR point cloud generation from user inputs, they struggle to attain high-quality results while enabling versatile controllability, due to the imbalance between the complex distribution of LiDAR point clouds and the simple control signals. To address the limitation, we propose LiDARDraft, which utilizes the 3D layout to build a bridge between versatile conditional signals and LiDAR point clouds. The 3D layout can be trivially generated from various user inputs such as textual descriptions and images. Specifically, we represent text, images, and point clouds as unified 3D layouts, which are further transformed into semantic and depth control signals. Then, we employ a rangemap-based ControlNet to guide LiDAR point cloud generation. This pixel-level alignment approach demonstrates excellent performance in controllable LiDAR point clouds generation, enabling "simulation from scratch", allowing self-driving environments to be created from arbitrary textual descriptions, images and sketches.

Conclusion: DDAVS框架有效解决了音频-视觉分割中的关键挑战，提升了模型在复杂真实场景下的分割性能与鲁棒性，具有较强的实用价值。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to localize sound-producing objects at the pixel level by jointly leveraging auditory and visual information. However, existing methods often suffer from multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment, which lead to biases toward louder or larger objects while overlooking weaker, smaller, or co-occurring sources. To address these challenges, we propose DDAVS, a Disentangled Audio Semantics and Delayed Bidirectional Alignment framework. To mitigate multi-source entanglement, DDAVS employs learnable queries to extract audio semantics and anchor them within a structured semantic space derived from an audio prototype memory bank. This is further optimized through contrastive learning to enhance discriminability and robustness. To alleviate audio-visual misalignment, DDAVS introduces dual cross-attention with delayed modality interaction, improving the robustness of multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments on the AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks demonstrate that DDAVS consistently outperforms existing approaches, exhibiting strong performance across single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance scenarios. These results validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our framework under challenging real-world audio-visual segmentation conditions.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) deliver state-of-the-art accuracy but their quadratic attention cost and redundant computations severely hinder deployment on latency and resource-constrained platforms. Existing pruning approaches treat either tokens or heads in isolation, relying on heuristics or first-order signals, which often sacrifice accuracy or fail to generalize across inputs. We introduce HEART-ViT, a Hessian-guided efficient dynamic attention and token pruning framework for vision transformers, which to the best of our knowledge is the first unified, second-order, input-adaptive framework for ViT optimization. HEART-ViT estimates curvature-weighted sensitivities of both tokens and attention heads using efficient Hessian-vector products, enabling principled pruning decisions under explicit loss budgets.This dual-view sensitivity reveals an important structural insight: token pruning dominates computational savings, while head pruning provides fine-grained redundancy removal, and their combination achieves a superior trade-off. On ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1K with ViT-B/16 and DeiT-B/16, HEART-ViT achieves up to 49.4 percent FLOPs reduction, 36 percent lower latency, and 46 percent higher throughput, while consistently matching or even surpassing baseline accuracy after fine-tuning, for example 4.7 percent recovery at 40 percent token pruning. Beyond theoretical benchmarks, we deploy HEART-ViT on different edge devices such as AGX Orin, demonstrating that our reductions in FLOPs and latency translate directly into real-world gains in inference speed and energy efficiency. HEART-ViT bridges the gap between theory and practice, delivering the first unified, curvature-driven pruning framework that is both accuracy-preserving and edge-efficient.

Method: 采用跨视图融合Mamba编码器高效提取长序列的时空特征，结合时空交叉注意力解码器预测多帧关节坐标，并引入速度损失以增强运动平滑性。

Result: 在TransHuPR和HuPR数据集上分别超过基线11.0 AP和14.6 AP，性能显著提升且计算复杂度合理。

Conclusion: milliMamba有效解决了雷达信号稀疏带来的挑战，通过时空建模和运动一致性约束，实现了高精度、低复杂度的雷达人体姿态估计。

Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar offers a privacy-preserving and lighting-invariant alternative to RGB sensors for Human Pose Estimation (HPE) task. However, the radar signals are often sparse due to specular reflection, making the extraction of robust features from radar signals highly challenging. To address this, we present milliMamba, a radar-based 2D human pose estimation framework that jointly models spatio-temporal dependencies across both the feature extraction and decoding stages. Specifically, given the high dimensionality of radar inputs, we adopt a Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from longer sequences with linear complexity. A Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder then predicts joint coordinates across multiple frames. Together, this spatio-temporal modeling pipeline enables the model to leverage contextual cues from neighboring frames and joints to infer missing joints caused by specular reflections. To reinforce motion smoothness, we incorporate a velocity loss alongside the standard keypoint loss during training. Experiments on the TransHuPR and HuPR datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements, exceeding the baselines by 11.0 AP and 14.6 AP, respectively, while maintaining reasonable complexity.

*Robert van de Ven,Trim Bresilla,Bram Nelissen,Ard Nieuwenhuizen,Eldert J. van Henten,Gert Kootstra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的果园场景3D重建与苹果姿态估计的自动化标注管道，利用3D Gaussian Splatting进行场景重建，简化标注流程，并通过自动投影生成大量训练标签。仅需105次人工标注即可生成28,191个训练样本，标注效率提升99.6%。实验表明，使用遮挡率不超过95%的果实数据训练效果最佳，原始图像上F1得分为0.927，渲染图像上达0.970。模型对位置估计在低遮挡时表现最好，随遮挡增加而下降；但对朝向估计能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统苹果姿态估计依赖关键点（如果柄）进行标注，但这些关键点常被遮挡，导致标注困难且易产生不一致或缺失。现有方法虽不再依赖关键点进行推理，但仍需其用于标注，限制了数据集扩展。因此需要一种更高效、鲁棒的标注方式以应对复杂果园环境中的遮挡问题。

Method: 提出一个集成3D Gaussian Splatting的端到端管道：首先重建果园三维场景，然后基于重建结果进行简化标注，再将标注信息自动投影回多视角图像中，最终用于训练和评估姿态估计模型。该方法显著减少人工标注需求。

Result: 仅需105次人工标注即生成28,191个训练标签，标注效率提升99.6%。在遮挡率≤95%的样本上训练的模型性能最优，原始图像F1为0.927，渲染图像达0.970。位置估计随遮挡程度增加而下降，但模型难以学习苹果朝向。调整训练数据规模对性能影响较小。

Conclusion: 所提出的3D重建驱动的自动化标注管道有效解决了果园环境中因遮挡导致的标注难题，大幅降低人工成本，同时支持高质量姿态估计模型训练。然而，当前方法在苹果朝向估计方面仍存在局限，未来可结合更精细的几何建模或先验知识改进。

Abstract: Automating tasks in orchards is challenging because of the large amount of variation in the environment and occlusions. One of the challenges is apple pose estimation, where key points, such as the calyx, are often occluded. Recently developed pose estimation methods no longer rely on these key points, but still require them for annotations, making annotating challenging and time-consuming. Due to the abovementioned occlusions, there can be conflicting and missing annotations of the same fruit between different images. Novel 3D reconstruction methods can be used to simplify annotating and enlarge datasets. We propose a novel pipeline consisting of 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct an orchard scene, simplified annotations, automated projection of the annotations to images, and the training and evaluation of a pose estimation method. Using our pipeline, 105 manual annotations were required to obtain 28,191 training labels, a reduction of 99.6%. Experimental results indicated that training with labels of fruits that are $\leq95\%$ occluded resulted in the best performance, with a neutral F1 score of 0.927 on the original images and 0.970 on the rendered images. Adjusting the size of the training dataset had small effects on the model performance in terms of F1 score and pose estimation accuracy. It was found that the least occluded fruits had the best position estimation, which worsened as the fruits became more occluded. It was also found that the tested pose estimation method was unable to correctly learn the orientation estimation of apples.

Abstract: Document image retrieval (DIR) aims to retrieve document images from a gallery according to a given query. Existing DIR methods are primarily based on image queries that retrieve documents within the same coarse semantic category, e.g., newspapers or receipts. However, these methods struggle to effectively retrieve document images in real-world scenarios where textual queries with fine-grained semantics are usually provided. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new Natural Language-based Document Image Retrieval (NL-DIR) benchmark with corresponding evaluation metrics. In this work, natural language descriptions serve as semantically rich queries for the DIR task. The NL-DIR dataset contains 41K authentic document images, each paired with five high-quality, fine-grained semantic queries generated and evaluated through large language models in conjunction with manual verification. We perform zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations of existing mainstream contrastive vision-language models and OCR-free visual document understanding (VDU) models. A two-stage retrieval method is further investigated for performance improvement while achieving both time and space efficiency. We hope the proposed NL-DIR benchmark can bring new opportunities and facilitate research for the VDU community. Datasets and codes will be publicly available at huggingface.co/datasets/nianbing/NL-DIR.

Abstract: Vision foundation models trained via multi-teacher distillation offer a promising path toward unified visual representations, yet the learning dynamics and data efficiency of such approaches remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study multi-teacher distillation for vision foundation models and identify key factors that enable training at lower computational cost. We introduce Agglomerative Mixture-of-Experts Vision Foundation Models (AMoE), which distill knowledge from SigLIP2 and DINOv3 simultaneously into a Mixture-of-Experts student. We show that (1) our Asymmetric Relation-Knowledge Distillation loss preserves the geometric properties of each teacher while enabling effective knowledge transfer, (2) token-balanced batching that packs varying-resolution images into sequences with uniform token budgets stabilizes representation learning across resolutions without sacrificing performance, and (3) hierarchical clustering and sampling of training data--typically reserved for self-supervised learning--substantially improves sample efficiency over random sampling for multi-teacher distillation. By combining these findings, we curate OpenLVD200M, a 200M-image corpus that demonstrates superior efficiency for multi-teacher distillation. Instantiated in a Mixture-of-Experts. We release OpenLVD200M and distilled models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种生成潜在编码（GLC）架构，通过在生成向量量化变分自编码器（VQ-VAE）的潜在空间中进行变换编码，而非传统的像素空间，以解决现有图像压缩方法在低比特率下难以同时实现高真实感和高保真度的问题。该潜在空间具有更高的稀疏性、更丰富的语义信息，并与人类感知更一致，从而提升压缩效果。此外，引入分类超模块降低超信息的比特开销，并采用基于代码预测的监督机制增强语义一致性。实验表明，GLC在自然图像上可实现低于0.04 bpp的压缩率，人脸图像低于0.01 bpp；在CLIC2020测试集上，与MS-ILLM相比，在45%更少的比特下达到相同的FID。该框架还支持图像修复、风格迁移等多种应用。


<details>

Motivation: 现有图像压缩方法在像素空间进行变换编码，难以在低比特率下兼顾高视觉真实感和高保真度，因为像素空间的失真与人类感知不一致。需要一种更符合人类感知且能保留丰富语义信息的编码方式。

Method: 提出生成潜在编码（GLC）架构，将变换编码从像素空间转移到生成式VQ-VAE的潜在空间；设计分类超模块以降低超信息的比特开销；引入基于代码预测的监督机制提升语义一致性。

Result: 在自然图像上压缩率低于0.04 bpp，人脸图像低于0.01 bpp；在CLIC2020测试集上，以45%更少的比特达到与MS-ILLM相当的FID；支持图像修复、风格迁移等下游任务。

Conclusion: 生成潜在编码（GLC）通过在语义丰富且感知对齐的潜在空间中进行压缩，显著提升了低比特率下的图像质量，并具备良好的扩展性与实用性。

Abstract: Most existing image compression approaches perform transform coding in the pixel space to reduce its spatial redundancy. However, they encounter difficulties in achieving both high-realism and high-fidelity at low bitrate, as the pixel-space distortion may not align with human perception. To address this issue, we introduce a Generative Latent Coding (GLC) architecture, which performs transform coding in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), instead of in the pixel space. The generative latent space is characterized by greater sparsity, richer semantic and better alignment with human perception, rendering it advantageous for achieving high-realism and high-fidelity compression. Additionally, we introduce a categorical hyper module to reduce the bit cost of hyper-information, and a code-prediction-based supervision to enhance the semantic consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our GLC maintains high visual quality with less than 0.04 bpp on natural images and less than 0.01 bpp on facial images. On the CLIC2020 test set, we achieve the same FID as MS-ILLM with 45% fewer bits. Furthermore, the powerful generative latent space enables various applications built on our GLC pipeline, such as image restoration and style transfer.

Abstract: Document layout analysis is essential for downstream tasks such as information retrieval, extraction, OCR, and digitization. However, existing large-scale datasets like PubLayNet and DocBank lack fine-grained region labels and multilingual diversity, making them insufficient for representing complex document layouts. In contrast, human-annotated datasets such as M6Doc and D4LA offer richer labels and greater domain diversity, but are too small to train robust models and lack adequate multilingual coverage. This gap is especially pronounced for Indic documents, which encompass diverse scripts yet remain underrepresented in current datasets, further limiting progress in this space. To address these shortcomings, we introduce IndicDLP, a large-scale foundational document layout dataset spanning 11 representative Indic languages alongside English and 12 common document domains. Additionally, we curate UED-mini, a dataset derived from DocLayNet and M6Doc, to enhance pretraining and provide a solid foundation for Indic layout models. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning existing English models on IndicDLP significantly boosts performance, validating its effectiveness. Moreover, models trained on IndicDLP generalize well beyond Indic layouts, making it a valuable resource for document digitization. This work bridges gaps in scale, diversity, and annotation granularity, driving inclusive and efficient document understanding.

Abstract: Unified hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration aims to recover various degraded HSIs using a single model, offering great practical value. However, existing methods often depend on explicit degradation priors (e.g., degradation labels) as prompts to guide restoration, which are difficult to obtain due to complex and mixed degradations in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-Aware Metric Prompting (DAMP) framework. Instead of relying on predefined degradation priors, we design spatial-spectral degradation metrics to continuously quantify multi-dimensional degradations, serving as Degradation Prompts (DP). These DP enable the model to capture cross-task similarities in degradation distributions and enhance shared feature learning. Furthermore, we introduce a Spatial-Spectral Adaptive Module (SSAM) that dynamically modulates spatial and spectral feature extraction through learnable parameters. By integrating SSAM as experts within a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, and using DP as the gating router, the framework enables adaptive, efficient, and robust restoration under diverse, mixed, or unseen degradations. Extensive experiments on natural and remote sensing HSI datasets show that DAMP achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates exceptional generalization capability.

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing image semantic segmentation (HRSS) is a fundamental yet critical task in the field of Earth observation. However, it has long faced the challenges of high inter-class similarity and large intra-class variability. Existing approaches often struggle to effectively inject abstract yet strongly discriminative semantic knowledge into pixel-level feature learning, leading to blurred boundaries and class confusion in complex scenes. To address these challenges, we propose Bidirectional Co-Refinement Framework for HRSS (BiCoR-Seg). Specifically, we design a Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy Module (HBIS), which establishes a bidirectional information flow between feature maps and class embeddings by generating class-level heatmaps. Based on HBIS, we further introduce a hierarchical supervision strategy, where the interpretable heatmaps generated by each HBIS module are directly utilized as low-resolution segmentation predictions for supervision, thereby enhancing the discriminative capacity of shallow features. In addition, to further improve the discriminability of the embedding representations, we propose a cross-layer class embedding Fisher Discriminative Loss to enforce intra-class compactness and enlarge inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA, Vaihingen, and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that BiCoR-Seg achieves outstanding segmentation performance while offering stronger interpretability.

Abstract: With the rise of easily accessible tools for generating and manipulating multimedia content, realistic synthetic alterations to digital media have become a widespread threat, often involving manipulations across multiple modalities simultaneously. Recently, such techniques have been increasingly employed to distort narratives of important events and to spread misinformation on social media, prompting the development of misinformation detectors. In the context of misinformation conveyed through image-text pairs, several detection methods have been proposed. However, these approaches typically rely on computationally intensive architectures or require large amounts of annotated data. In this work we introduce LADLE-MM: Limited Annotation based Detector with Learned Ensembles for Multimodal Misinformation, a model-soup initialized multimodal misinformation detector designed to operate under a limited annotation setup and constrained training resources. LADLE-MM is composed of two unimodal branches and a third multimodal one that enhances image and text representations with additional multimodal embeddings extracted from BLIP, serving as fixed reference space. Despite using 60.3% fewer trainable parameters than previous state-of-the-art models, LADLE-MM achieves competitive performance on both binary and multi-label classification tasks on the DGM4 benchmark, outperforming existing methods when trained without grounding annotations. Moreover, when evaluated on the VERITE dataset, LADLE-MM outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches that utilize more complex architectures involving Large Vision-Language-Models, demonstrating the effective generalization ability in an open-set setting and strong robustness to unimodal bias.

Conclusion: ${D}^{3}$ETOR通过联合利用伪标签与草图语义监督信号，有效提升了弱监督伪装目标检测的精度与泛化能力，为该领域提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (WSCOD) aims to locate and segment objects that are visually concealed within their surrounding scenes, relying solely on sparse supervision such as scribble annotations. Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to its widespread adoption across diverse domains, including medical imaging. This progress is driven by increasingly sophisticated model architectures, such as ResNets, Vision Transformers, and Hybrid Convolutional Neural Networks, that offer enhanced performance at the cost of greater complexity. This complexity often compromises model explainability and interpretability. SHAP has emerged as a prominent method for providing interpretable visualizations that aid domain experts in understanding model predictions. However, SHAP explanations can be unstable and unreliable in the presence of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. In this study, we address this challenge by using Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify the uncertainty that arises from these unstable explanations in medical imaging applications. The framework uses a belief, plausible, and fusion map approach alongside statistical quantitative analysis to produce quantification of uncertainty in SHAP. Furthermore, we evaluated our framework on three medical imaging datasets with varying class distributions, image qualities, and modality types which introduces noise due to varying image resolutions and modality-specific aspect covering the examples from pathology, ophthalmology, and radiology, introducing significant epistemic uncertainty.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TAVID的统一框架，旨在从文本和参考图像中联合生成交互式视频和对话语音。该框架通过两个跨模态映射器（运动映射器和说话者映射器）将面部和语音生成流程整合，实现音视频模态间的双向信息交换，从而生成同步且自然的人机交互内容。实验在真实感、响应性、互动流畅性和语音质量四个方面验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常孤立地处理说话头生成或对话语音生成，忽视了人类对话中音视频紧密耦合的多模态特性。为了构建更接近人类的对话系统，亟需一种能够同步生成逼真面部动作和自然语音的统一框架。

Method: TAVID框架通过引入运动映射器和说话者映射器，实现音频与视觉模态之间的双向信息传递。运动映射器将语音特征转换为面部运动参数，说话者映射器则将面部特征反向映射到语音特征，从而确保音视频在时间上同步且语义一致。

Result: 在多个评估维度上，TAVID均表现出优越性能：生成的说话人脸具有高度真实感，听头反应灵敏，双人互动流畅自然，语音质量高。实验结果证明该方法在多模态交互生成任务中的有效性与鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TAVID成功实现了音视频模态的联合生成与同步，显著提升了人机对话系统的自然性和交互体验，为构建下一代拟人化交互系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to jointly synthesize interactive videos and conversational speech from text and reference images. With the ultimate goal of building human-like conversational systems, recent studies have explored talking or listening head generation as well as conversational speech generation. However, these works are typically studied in isolation, overlooking the multimodal nature of human conversation, which involves tightly coupled audio-visual interactions. In this paper, we introduce TAVID, a unified framework that generates both interactive faces and conversational speech in a synchronized manner. TAVID integrates face and speech generation pipelines through two cross-modal mappers (i.e., a motion mapper and a speaker mapper), which enable bidirectional exchange of complementary information between the audio and visual modalities. We evaluate our system across four dimensions: talking face realism, listening head responsiveness, dyadic interaction fluency, and speech quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across all these aspects.

Conclusion: KeyTailor通过关键帧驱动的信息注入机制，在不改变DiT架构的前提下，实现了高效、真实的视频虚拟试穿，有效解决了服装动态建模与背景一致性难题，结合高质量数据集进一步提升了模型性能与泛化能力。

Abstract: Although diffusion transformer (DiT)-based video virtual try-on (VVT) has made significant progress in synthesizing realistic videos, existing methods still struggle to capture fine-grained garment dynamics and preserve background integrity across video frames. They also incur high computational costs due to additional interaction modules introduced into DiTs, while the limited scale and quality of existing public datasets also restrict model generalization and effective training. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, KeyTailor, along with a large-scale, high-definition dataset, ViT-HD. The core idea of KeyTailor is a keyframe-driven details injection strategy, motivated by the fact that keyframes inherently contain both foreground dynamics and background consistency. Specifically, KeyTailor adopts an instruction-guided keyframe sampling strategy to filter informative frames from the input video. Subsequently,two tailored keyframe-driven modules, the garment details enhancement module and the collaborative background optimization module, are employed to distill garment dynamics into garment-related latents and to optimize the integrity of background latents, both guided by keyframes.These enriched details are then injected into standard DiT blocks together with pose, mask, and noise latents, enabling efficient and realistic try-on video synthesis. This design ensures consistency without explicitly modifying the DiT architecture, while simultaneously avoiding additional complexity. In addition, our dataset ViT-HD comprises 15, 070 high-quality video samples at a resolution of 810*1080, covering diverse garments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KeyTailor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of garment fidelity and background integrity across both dynamic and static scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have accelerated the production of ultra-high-resolution visual content, posing significant challenges for efficient compression and real-time decoding on end-user devices. Inspired by 3D Gaussian Splatting, recent 2D Gaussian image models improve representation efficiency, yet existing methods struggle to balance compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. To address this issue, we propose SmartSplat, a highly adaptive and feature-aware GS-based image compression framework that supports arbitrary image resolutions and compression ratios. SmartSplat leverages image-aware features such as gradients and color variances, introducing a Gradient-Color Guided Variational Sampling strategy together with an Exclusion-based Uniform Sampling scheme to improve the non-overlapping coverage of Gaussian primitives in pixel space. In addition, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Color Sampling method to enhance color initialization across scales. Through joint optimization of spatial layout, scale, and color initialization, SmartSplat efficiently captures both local structures and global textures using a limited number of Gaussians, achieving high reconstruction quality under strong compression. Extensive experiments on DIV8K and a newly constructed 16K dataset demonstrate that SmartSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods at comparable compression ratios and exceeds their compression limits, showing strong scalability and practical applicability. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/lif314/SmartSplat.

*Junho Yoon,Jaemo Jung,Hyunju Kim,Dongman Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出DETACH框架，通过分解时空特征并引入基于在线聚类的传感器-空间特征，解决外视角视频与环境传感器对齐中的局部细节丢失和语义上下文误对齐问题。采用两阶段对齐策略：先通过相互监督建立空间对应关系，再利用时空加权对比损失进行时间对齐，显著提升在Opportunity++和HWU-USP数据集上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于第一人称视角与可穿戴设备的方法虽在动作识别中表现良好，但存在用户不适、隐私问题及可扩展性差等实际限制。因此，探索非侵入式且可扩展的外视角视频与环境传感器融合方案成为必要。然而，传统全局对齐方法在该场景下因无法捕捉细微运动（问题P1）以及过度依赖模态不变的时间模式导致语义上下文混淆（问题P2），难以有效对齐。

Method: 提出DETACH框架，包含三个核心组件：（1）显式分解时空特征以保留局部细节；（2）通过在线聚类生成传感器-空间特征，提供语义支撑实现上下文感知对齐；（3）采用两阶段对齐机制——首先通过相互监督建立空间对应关系，其次使用时空加权对比损失自适应处理易负样本、难负样本与假负样本，实现精准时间对齐。

Result: 在Opportunity++和HWU-USP两个下游任务数据集上，所提方法显著优于适配后的第一人称-可穿戴基线模型，验证了其在非侵入式场景下的有效性与优越性。

Conclusion: DETACH框架成功解决了外视角视频与环境传感器对齐中的关键挑战，通过显式分解与语义引导的对齐机制，在保证非侵入性与可扩展性的前提下实现了更准确的动作识别，为未来智能环境中的行为理解提供了新范式。

Abstract: Aligning egocentric video with wearable sensors have shown promise for human action recognition, but face practical limitations in user discomfort, privacy concerns, and scalability. We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives. Comprehensive experiments with downstream tasks on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines.

*Pedro Domingos,João Pereira,Vasco Lopes,João Neves,David Semedo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Chain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts（CoAT）框架，通过引入异常导向的分类层，在大型视觉-语言模型中加入归纳性犯罪偏见，以解决其对正常情况的固有偏向问题，显著提升低分辨率视频中的异常检测F1分数（+11.8 p.p.）和高分辨率视频中的异常分类准确率（+3.78 p.p.）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉-语言模型在自动视频监控中因对正常情况的固有偏向而难以检测犯罪行为，尽管思维链推理在语言任务中表现良好，但缺乏归纳性异常偏差，导致模型仍倾向于正常解释。

Method: 提出多智能体推理框架CoAT，通过最终的异常聚焦分类层引入归纳性犯罪偏见，增强模型对异常事件的敏感性。

Result: 在低分辨率视频上，异常检测的F1分数提升11.8个百分点；在高分辨率视频上，异常分类准确率提升3.78个百分点。

Conclusion: CoAT框架有效缓解了大型视觉-语言模型在视频监控中对正常性的偏好，显著提升了异常检测与分类性能，为智能安防系统提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated video surveillance with Large Vision-Language Models is limited by their inherent bias towards normality, often failing to detect crimes. While Chain-of-Thought reasoning strategies show significant potential for improving performance in language tasks, the lack of inductive anomaly biases in their reasoning further steers the models towards normal interpretations. To address this, we propose Chain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts (CoAT), a multi-agent reasoning framework that introduces inductive criminal bias in the reasoning process through a final, anomaly-focused classification layer. Our method significantly improves Anomaly Detection, boosting F1-score by 11.8 p.p. on challenging low-resolution footage and Anomaly Classification by 3.78 p.p. in high-resolution videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对具有平滑背景和稀疏异常的纹理图像的高效异常检测方法——纹理基集成平滑分解（TBSD）。该方法通过学习纹理基函数来提取准周期性纹理模式，并利用这些基作为先验知识，有效避免纹理误判，提升异常检测精度。相比现有方法，TBSD在更小的数据集上表现更优，且在模拟与真实数据集上均展现出更强的鲁棒性和更低的误检率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统异常检测方法在处理纹理缺陷图像时存在误检率高、鲁棒性差以及对大规模结构化数据依赖性强的问题，尤其在处理具有准周期性纹理的图像时表现不佳，因此亟需一种能够精准识别纹理并有效捕捉稀疏异常的新方法。

Method: 提出纹理基集成平滑分解（TBSD）方法，包含两个阶段：第一阶段通过数学建模和理论分析，挖掘图像纹理的准周期性特征，学习纹理基函数以提取准周期性纹理模式；第二阶段利用学习到的纹理基作为先验信息，在异常检测中抑制纹理误判，实现高精度异常定位。

Result: TBSD在多种模拟和真实世界数据集上均显著优于现有基准方法，表现出更低的误检率、更强的鲁棒性，并且仅需较小规模的训练数据即可达到优异性能，验证了其在实际应用中的高效性与可行性。

Conclusion: TBSD方法为纹理图像中的异常检测提供了一种高效、低依赖、高精度的解决方案，特别适用于制造系统中对纹理缺陷进行快速准确识别的场景，具有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: In the realm of diverse high-dimensional data, images play a significant role across various processes of manufacturing systems where efficient image anomaly detection has emerged as a core technology of utmost importance. However, when applied to textured defect images, conventional anomaly detection methods have limitations including non-negligible misidentification, low robustness, and excessive reliance on large-scale and structured datasets. This paper proposes a texture basis integrated smooth decomposition (TBSD) approach, which is targeted at efficient anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds and sparse anomalies. Mathematical formulation of quasi-periodicity and its theoretical properties are investigated for image texture estimation. TBSD method consists of two principal processes: the first process learns the texture basis functions to effectively extract quasi-periodic texture patterns; the subsequent anomaly detection process utilizes that texture basis as prior knowledge to prevent texture misidentification and capture potential anomalies with high accuracy.The proposed method surpasses benchmarks with less misidentification, smaller training dataset requirement, and superior anomaly detection performance on both simulation and real-world datasets.

Motivation: 现有方法多忽略生物力学中关键的关节驱动力等物理线索，而这些线索在动态、遮挡或外观变化条件下可能对动作理解具有重要补充作用，因此需探究力信息是否以及何时能提升动作理解性能。

Method: 将物理推断的力信息整合进主流动作理解模型（如CTR-GCN、Qwen2.5-VL）中，分别在步态识别、动作识别和视频描述任务上进行实验验证，对比加入力信息前后的性能差异。

Result: 在8个不同基准测试中，引入力信息后性能普遍提升：步态识别最高提升3.0%（侧视+3.0%，穿外套+2.7%），动作识别中高用力动作提升达6.96%，视频描述的ROUGE-L得分从0.310升至0.339，说明力线索有助于提升时序定位与语义表达能力。

Conclusion: 物理推断的力信息能有效补充视觉与运动学特征，特别是在复杂或挑战性场景下，显著增强动作理解的鲁棒性和准确性，为未来融合多模态物理先验提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Human motion understanding has advanced rapidly through vision-based progress in recognition, tracking, and captioning. However, most existing methods overlook physical cues such as joint actuation forces that are fundamental in biomechanics. This gap motivates our study: if and when do physically inferred forces enhance motion understanding? By incorporating forces into established motion understanding pipelines, we systematically evaluate their impact across baseline models on 3 major tasks: gait recognition, action recognition, and fine-grained video captioning. Across 8 benchmarks, incorporating forces yields consistent performance gains; for example, on CASIA-B, Rank-1 gait recognition accuracy improved from 89.52% to 90.39% (+0.87), with larger gain observed under challenging conditions: +2.7% when wearing a coat and +3.0% at the side view. On Gait3D, performance also increases from 46.0% to 47.3% (+1.3). In action recognition, CTR-GCN achieved +2.00% on Penn Action, while high-exertion classes like punching/slapping improved by +6.96%. Even in video captioning, Qwen2.5-VL's ROUGE-L score rose from 0.310 to 0.339 (+0.029), indicating that physics-inferred forces enhance temporal grounding and semantic richness. These results demonstrate that force cues can substantially complement visual and kinematic features under dynamic, occluded, or appearance-varying conditions.

Abstract: AI-assisted graphic design has emerged as a powerful tool for automating the creation and editing of design elements such as posters, banners, and advertisements. While diffusion-based text-to-image models have demonstrated strong capabilities in visual content generation, their text rendering performance, particularly for small-scale typography and non-Latin scripts, remains limited. In this paper, we propose UTDesign, a unified framework for high-precision stylized text editing and conditional text generation in design images, supporting both English and Chinese scripts. Our framework introduces a novel DiT-based text style transfer model trained from scratch on a synthetic dataset, capable of generating transparent RGBA text foregrounds that preserve the style of reference glyphs. We further extend this model into a conditional text generation framework by training a multi-modal condition encoder on a curated dataset with detailed text annotations, enabling accurate, style-consistent text synthesis conditioned on background images, prompts, and layout specifications. Finally, we integrate our approach into a fully automated text-to-design (T2D) pipeline by incorporating pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models and an MLLM-based layout planner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UTDesign achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods in terms of stylistic consistency and text accuracy, and also exhibits unique advantages compared to proprietary commercial approaches.

Abstract: Landmines remain a persistent humanitarian threat, with 110 million actively deployed mines across 60 countries, claiming 26,000 casualties annually. This research evaluates adaptive Red-Green-Blue (RGB) and Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) fusion for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)-based detection of surface-laid landmines, leveraging the thermal contrast between the ordnance and the surrounding soil to enhance feature extraction. Using You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures (v8, v10, v11) across 114 test images, generating 35,640 model-condition evaluations, YOLOv11 achieved optimal performance (86.8% mAP), with 10 to 30% thermal fusion at 5 to 10m altitude identified as the optimal detection parameters. A complementary architectural comparison revealed that while RF-DETR achieved the highest accuracy (69.2% mAP), followed by Faster R-CNN (67.6%), YOLOv11 (64.2%), and RetinaNet (50.2%), YOLOv11 trained 17.7 times faster than the transformer-based RF-DETR (41 minutes versus 12 hours), presenting a critical accuracy-efficiency tradeoff for operational deployment. Aggregated multi-temporal training datasets outperformed season-specific approaches by 1.8 to 9.6%, suggesting that models benefit from exposure to diverse thermal conditions. Anti-Tank (AT) mines achieved 61.9% detection accuracy, compared with 19.2% for Anti-Personnel (AP) mines, reflecting both the size differential and thermal-mass differences between these ordnance classes. As this research examined surface-laid mines where thermal contrast is maximized, future research should quantify thermal contrast effects for mines buried at varying depths across heterogeneous soil types.

Abstract: This manuscript explores multimodal alignment, translation, fusion, and transference to enhance machine understanding of complex inputs. We organize the work into five chapters, each addressing unique challenges in multimodal machine learning.
  Chapter 3 introduces Spatial-Reasoning Bert for translating text-based spatial relations into 2D arrangements between clip-arts. This enables effective decoding of spatial language into visual representations, paving the way for automated scene generation aligned with human spatial understanding.
  Chapter 4 presents a method for translating medical texts into specific 3D locations within an anatomical atlas. We introduce a loss function leveraging spatial co-occurrences of medical terms to create interpretable mappings, significantly enhancing medical text navigability.
  Chapter 5 tackles translating structured text into canonical facts within knowledge graphs. We develop a benchmark for linking natural language to entities and predicates, addressing ambiguities in text extraction to provide clearer, actionable insights.
  Chapter 6 explores multimodal fusion methods for compositional action recognition. We propose a method fusing video frames and object detection representations, improving recognition robustness and accuracy.
  Chapter 7 investigates multimodal knowledge transference for egocentric action recognition. We demonstrate how multimodal knowledge distillation enables RGB-only models to mimic multimodal fusion-based capabilities, reducing computational requirements while maintaining performance.
  These contributions advance methodologies for spatial language understanding, medical text interpretation, knowledge graph enrichment, and action recognition, enhancing computational systems' ability to process complex, multimodal inputs across diverse applications.

*Mingwei Tang,Jiahao Nie,Guang Yang,Ziqing Cui,Jie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种多粒度文本引导的图像融合方法（MTIF），通过细粒度、结构和语义三个层次的文本描述，结合跨模态调制与监督信号，提升图像融合质量。引入显著性驱动的数据增强模块以丰富训练内容，实验表明在多曝光和多焦点融合任务中均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用粗粒度文本描述，难以捕捉细节信息，导致跨模态对齐困难，影响融合效果。

Method: 提出多粒度文本描述，设计层次化跨模态调制模块；在每个粒度层级引入监督信号以促进视觉-文本特征对齐；采用显著性驱动的增强模块扩充训练数据，强化跨模态交互。

Result: 在多曝光和多焦点图像融合任务上，MTIF consistently 超过已有方法，显著提升融合图像质量。

Conclusion: MTIF 通过多粒度文本引导和精细化跨模态对齐机制，有效解决了图像融合中动态范围与聚焦差异的挑战，为基于视觉-语言模型的图像融合提供了新范式。

Abstract: Image fusion aims to synthesize a single high-quality image from a pair of inputs captured under challenging conditions, such as differing exposure levels or focal depths. A core challenge lies in effectively handling disparities in dynamic range and focus depth between the inputs. With the advent of vision-language models, recent methods incorporate textual descriptions as auxiliary guidance to enhance fusion quality. However, simply incorporating coarse-grained descriptions hampers the understanding of fine-grained details and poses challenges for precise cross-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-grained Text-guided Image Fusion (MTIF), a novel fusion paradigm with three key designs. First, it introduces multi-grained textual descriptions that separately capture fine details, structural cues, and semantic content, guiding image fusion through a hierarchical cross-modal modulation module. Second, it involves supervision signals at each granularity to facilitate alignment between visual and textual features and enhance the utility of auxiliary text. Third, it adopts a saliency-driven enrichment module to augment training data with dense semantic content, further strengthening the cross-modal modulation and alignment. Extensive experiments show that MTIF consistently outperforms previous methods on both multi-exposure and multi-focus image fusion tasks.

*Kaitong Cai,Jusheng Zhang,Jing Yang,Yijia Fan,Pengtao Xie,Jian Wang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashVLM提出一种文本引导的视觉标记选择框架，通过显式跨模态相似性计算与视觉显著性融合，动态适应文本查询，实现高效且稳定的视觉标记压缩，在保持高精度的同时可压缩77.8%至94.4%的视觉标记，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉标记压缩方法常忽略文本查询或依赖不稳定的深层注意力图，导致语义对齐下降，尤其在激进剪枝下表现不佳。

Method: FlashVLM通过投影图像标记与归一化文本嵌入在语言模型空间中的显式跨模态相似性，结合对数域加权和温度控制锐化，融合外在相关性与内在视觉显著性，并采用多样性保留分区以维持全局上下文。

Result: 在相同标记预算和评估协议下，FlashVLM实现无损压缩以上性能，优于未压缩基线；在LLaVA 1.5上最多剪枝77.8%视觉标记，94.4%压缩率下仍保持92.8%准确率；14个图像与视频基准测试中展现最优效率-性能权衡及强鲁棒性与泛化能力。

Conclusion: FlashVLM通过文本引导的动态标记选择机制，实现了高效、稳定且通用的视觉标记压缩，显著提升大视觉语言模型的推理效率，同时保持高质量的语义理解能力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) typically process hundreds or thousands of visual tokens per image or video frame, incurring quadratic attention cost and substantial redundancy. Existing token reduction methods often ignore the textual query or rely on deep attention maps, whose instability under aggressive pruning leads to degraded semantic alignment.
  We propose FlashVLM, a text guided visual token selection framework that dynamically adapts visual inputs to the query. Instead of relying on noisy attention weights, FlashVLM computes an explicit cross modal similarity between projected image tokens and normalized text embeddings in the language model space. This extrinsic relevance is fused with intrinsic visual saliency using log domain weighting and temperature controlled sharpening. In addition, a diversity preserving partition retains a minimal yet representative set of background tokens to maintain global context.
  Under identical token budgets and evaluation protocols, FlashVLM achieves beyond lossless compression, slightly surpassing the unpruned baseline while pruning up to 77.8 percent of visual tokens on LLaVA 1.5, and maintaining 92.8 percent accuracy even under 94.4 percent compression. Extensive experiments on 14 image and video benchmarks demonstrate that FlashVLM delivers state of the art efficiency performance trade offs while maintaining strong robustness and generalization across mainstream VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了模拟环境中专家演示与学生观测之间的不对齐问题如何限制模仿学习的性能。专家拥有更高的可见性和更低的不确定性，而学生仅通过单一目标点获取导航意图，导致模仿困难。通过改进以缩小差距，提出的TransFuser v6（TFv6）在CARLA多个基准上达到新纪录，显著提升性能，并在NAVSIM和Waymo视觉端到端驾驶基准上实现一致增益。代码、数据和模型已公开。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究模拟环境中专家演示与学生观测之间的不对齐问题对模仿学习性能的影响，尤其是高可见性、低不确定性及导航意图不明确带来的挑战。

Method: 通过分析专家与学生之间的感知差异，提出针对性改进措施，优化学生模型以缩小与专家的差距；结合感知监督，构建共享的仿真到现实迁移管道。

Result: TransFuser v6在所有主要公开的CARLA闭环基准测试中均达到新状态，如95 DS on Bench2Drive，Longest6~v2和Town13性能翻倍；在NAVSIM和Waymo视觉端到端驾驶基准上也取得稳定提升。

Conclusion: 专家与学生间的感知与意图不对齐是制约模仿学习性能的关键因素。通过系统性修正这些差距，可显著提升自动驾驶模型在复杂场景下的鲁棒性与泛化能力。

Abstract: Simulators can generate virtually unlimited driving data, yet imitation learning policies in simulation still struggle to achieve robust closed-loop performance. Motivated by this gap, we empirically study how misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations can limit the effectiveness of imitation learning. More precisely, experts have significantly higher visibility (e.g., ignoring occlusions) and far lower uncertainty (e.g., knowing other vehicles' actions), making them difficult to imitate reliably. Furthermore, navigational intent (i.e., the route to follow) is under-specified in student models at test time via only a single target point. We demonstrate that these asymmetries can measurably limit driving performance in CARLA and offer practical interventions to address them. After careful modifications to narrow the gaps between expert and student, our TransFuser v6 (TFv6) student policy achieves a new state of the art on all major publicly available CARLA closed-loop benchmarks, reaching 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13. Additionally, by integrating perception supervision from our dataset into a shared sim-to-real pipeline, we show consistent gains on the NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End driving benchmarks. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/autonomousvision/lead.

*Daewoon Kim,Si Young Yie,Jae Sung Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedPOD 提出一种优化联邦学习中多个客户端学习效率和通信成本的方法。受 FedPIDAvg 启发，通过定义轮次任务提升训练效率，结合泊松分布建模数据分布与 PID 控制器降低通信开销，同时解决其排除异常值导致数据利用率下降及依赖历史信息的问题。FedPOD 引入每轮验证损失计算，不依赖前几轮信息，并可灵活扩展为类似 Kubernetes POD 的弹性伸缩单位，实现高效、灵活、性能优越的联邦学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如 FedPIDAvg 虽能提升性能并降低通信成本，但存在因排除异常值导致数据利用率低，以及依赖历史轮次学习信息而限制参与方灵活性的问题。因此需要一种更高效、更具弹性和包容性的联邦学习优化机制。

Method: FedPOD 采用泊松分布建模数据分布，设计基于验证损失的轮次任务机制，避免依赖前序轮次信息；引入可扩展的 POD 单位概念，借鉴 Kubernetes 自动伸缩思想，实现动态资源调度与灵活扩展。

Result: FedPOD 在 Dice 分数上达到平均 0.78（WT）、0.71（ET）、0.72（TC），投影收敛分数平均 0.74，性能与 FedPIDAvg 相当，且在通信成本、数据利用和系统灵活性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: FedPOD 通过创新的任务设计与弹性架构，显著提升了联邦学习的效率、灵活性和鲁棒性，具备在实际场景中广泛应用的潜力。

Abstract: This paper proposes FedPOD (Proportionally Orchestrated Derivative) for optimizing learning efficiency and communication cost in federated learning among multiple clients. Inspired by FedPIDAvg, we define a round-wise task for FedPOD to enhance training efficiency. FedPIDAvg achieved performance improvement by incorporating the training loss reduction for prediction entropy as weights using differential terms. Furthermore, by modeling data distribution with a Poisson distribution and using a PID controller, it reduced communication costs even in skewed data distribution. However, excluding participants classified as outliers based on the Poisson distribution can limit data utilization. Additionally, PID controller requires the same participants to be maintained throughout the federated learning process as it uses previous rounds' learning information in the current round. In our approach, FedPOD addresses these issues by including participants excluded as outliers, eliminating dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and applying a method for calculating validation loss at each round. In this challenge, FedPOD presents comparable performance to FedPIDAvg in metrics of Dice score, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.72 for WT, ET and TC in average, and projected convergence score, 0.74 in average. Furthermore, the concept of FedPOD draws inspiration from Kubernetes' smallest computing unit, POD, designed to be compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling. Extending round-wise tasks of FedPOD to POD units allows flexible design by applying scale-out similar to Kubernetes' auto-scaling. This work demonstrated the potentials of FedPOD to enhance federated learning by improving efficiency, flexibility, and performance in metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出L-IVA（长时交互视觉化身）任务与基准，以及ORCA框架，使视频化身具备自主目标导向规划能力。ORCA通过闭环OTAR循环和双系统架构，在生成环境中实现状态跟踪与策略推理，将化身控制建模为部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP），并通过持续验证预测结果提升鲁棒性，显著提升任务成功率与行为连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频化身生成方法虽能保持身份一致性和动作对齐，但缺乏真正的自主性，无法通过适应性环境互动实现长期目标。需要一种能够主动规划、在随机生成环境中自主决策的智能体。

Method: 提出ORCA框架，包含：(1) 闭环OTAR循环（观察-思考-行动-反思），通过持续验证预测与实际生成结果来维持状态追踪；(2) 分层双系统架构：系统2进行战略推理与状态预测，系统1将抽象计划转化为具体动作描述。整体将化身控制建模为POMDP，并实现连续信念更新。

Result: 在开放域场景中，ORCA在任务成功率和行为连贯性方面显著优于开环及非反思型基线模型，验证了基于内部世界模型的设计有效推动视频化身从被动动画向主动、目标导向行为演进。

Conclusion: ORCA通过引入内部世界模型机制，实现了视频化身在复杂、不确定环境中的主动智能，标志着视频化身从静态生成迈向具有长期目标规划能力的智能体。

Abstract: Current video avatar generation methods excel at identity preservation and motion alignment but lack genuine agency, they cannot autonomously pursue long-term goals through adaptive environmental interaction. We address this by introducing L-IVA (Long-horizon Interactive Visual Avatar), a task and benchmark for evaluating goal-directed planning in stochastic generative environments, and ORCA (Online Reasoning and Cognitive Architecture), the first framework enabling active intelligence in video avatars. ORCA embodies Internal World Model (IWM) capabilities through two key innovations: (1) a closed-loop OTAR cycle (Observe-Think-Act-Reflect) that maintains robust state tracking under generative uncertainty by continuously verifying predicted outcomes against actual generations, and (2) a hierarchical dual-system architecture where System 2 performs strategic reasoning with state prediction while System 1 translates abstract plans into precise, model-specific action captions. By formulating avatar control as a POMDP and implementing continuous belief updating with outcome verification, ORCA enables autonomous multi-step task completion in open-domain scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ORCA significantly outperforms open-loop and non-reflective baselines in task success rate and behavioral coherence, validating our IWM-inspired design for advancing video avatar intelligence from passive animation to active, goal-oriented behavior.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemanticGen提出了一种在语义空间中生成视频的新方法，通过两阶段扩散模型实现：先生成紧凑的语义特征以规划全局布局，再基于这些特征生成VAE潜变量以输出最终视频。该方法显著提升了训练收敛速度和长视频生成效率，且在质量上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在VAE潜空间中直接建模大量低级视频标记，导致收敛慢且计算开销大，尤其在长视频生成时问题更严重。因此需要一种更高效、更快速的生成策略。

Method: 采用两阶段扩散模型：第一阶段用扩散模型生成紧凑的语义视频特征，用于全局布局规划；第二阶段用另一个扩散模型在语义特征条件下生成VAE潜变量，从而生成最终视频。

Result: 实验表明，SemanticGen在生成速度、收敛性及长视频生成方面均表现优异，生成视频质量高，优于当前主流方法和强基线。

Conclusion: 通过在语义空间中进行视频生成，SemanticGen有效缓解了传统方法在收敛速度与计算成本上的瓶颈，为高质量、高效长视频生成提供了新范式。

Abstract: State-of-the-art video generative models typically learn the distribution of video latents in the VAE space and map them to pixels using a VAE decoder. While this approach can generate high-quality videos, it suffers from slow convergence and is computationally expensive when generating long videos. In this paper, we introduce SemanticGen, a novel solution to address these limitations by generating videos in the semantic space. Our main insight is that, due to the inherent redundancy in videos, the generation process should begin in a compact, high-level semantic space for global planning, followed by the addition of high-frequency details, rather than directly modeling a vast set of low-level video tokens using bi-directional attention. SemanticGen adopts a two-stage generation process. In the first stage, a diffusion model generates compact semantic video features, which define the global layout of the video. In the second stage, another diffusion model generates VAE latents conditioned on these semantic features to produce the final output. We observe that generation in the semantic space leads to faster convergence compared to the VAE latent space. Our method is also effective and computationally efficient when extended to long video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemanticGen produces high-quality videos and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines.

*Kirk Vanacore,Rene F. Kizilcec*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了六种大型语言模型（LLMs）在无需定制化的情况下，对真实课堂转录文本中的教学行为进行分类的基准性能。通过零样本、单样本和少样本提示方法进行测试，发现少样本提示显著提升了先进模型的表现，最佳配置达到Cohen's Kappa = 0.58，但性能在不同教学行为间差异明显，且高召回率常伴随更多误报。总体表明，基础模型具备一定解读教学话语的能力，但仍有局限，提示设计可增强其表现，但无法消除可靠性瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在教育技术中的广泛应用，了解其在未经定制化情况下的原始能力至关重要，有助于设定合理预期并建立基准。

Method: 对比六种LLMs在真实课堂转录数据上进行教学行为分类任务，采用零样本、单样本和少样本提示方法进行评估。

Result: 少样本提示显著提升性能，最强模型达到Cohen's Kappa = 0.58；但性能在不同教学行为间差异大，高召回率常伴随高误报率。

Conclusion: 基础模型具备一定的教学话语解读能力，但存在局限性；提示设计可部分释放潜力，但无法完全克服可靠性问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in educational technologies for a variety of tasks, from generating instructional materials and assisting with assessment design to tutoring. While prior work has investigated how models can be adapted or optimized for specific tasks, far less is known about how well LLMs perform at interpreting authentic educational scenarios without significant customization. As LLM-based systems become widely adopted by learners and educators in everyday academic contexts, understanding their out-of-the-box capabilities is increasingly important for setting expectations and benchmarking. We compared six LLMs to estimate their baseline performance on a simple but important task: classifying instructional moves in authentic classroom transcripts. We evaluated typical prompting methods: zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting. We found that while zero-shot performance was moderate, providing comprehensive examples (few-shot prompting) significantly improved performance for state-of-the-art models, with the strongest configuration reaching Cohen's Kappa = 0.58 against expert-coded annotations. At the same time, improvements were neither uniform nor complete: performance varied considerably by instructional move, and higher recall frequently came at the cost of increased false positives. Overall, these findings indicate that foundation models demonstrate meaningful yet limited capacity to interpret instructional discourse, with prompt design helping to surface capability but not eliminating fundamental reliability constraints.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的反事实框架，用于量化机器学习论文中的修辞风格，独立于实质性内容。通过生成多个修辞人格的反事实文本，利用LLM判别器进行成对评估，并用Bradley-Terry模型聚合结果，研究分析了8485篇ICLR论文（2017–2025），发现愿景式表述显著预测后续关注度（如引用和媒体报道），且自2023年起修辞强度明显上升，主要受LLM写作辅助工具推动。该框架在不同人格设定下具有鲁棒性，且LLM判断与人工标注高度相关，验证了其可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人工智能热潮引发对机器学习论文中‘夸大’现象的担忧，但缺乏独立于内容的修辞风格量化方法。现有方法难以区分强烈语言是源于真实成果还是纯粹修辞，亟需一种可分离修辞与实质内容的评估手段。

Method: 构建基于大语言模型的反事实框架：设定多个修辞人格，从相同内容生成不同风格的反事实文本；使用另一个LLM作为判别器进行成对比较；通过Bradley-Terry模型汇总判断结果，实现修辞风格的量化。

Result: 在8,485篇ICLR论文上生成超过25万份反事实文本；发现愿景式表述显著提升论文的关注度，即使控制同行评审后依然成立；2023年后修辞强度显著上升，主要由LLM辅助写作驱动；框架对人格选择不敏感，且LLM判断与人类标注高度一致。

Conclusion: 本研究证明，大语言模型可作为科学评价的测量与改进工具，为客观评估学术论文的修辞风格提供了可扩展、可靠的方法，并揭示了技术进步对学术表达方式的深远影响。

Abstract: The rise of AI has fueled growing concerns about ``hype'' in machine learning papers, yet a reliable way to quantify rhetorical style independently of substantive content has remained elusive. Because bold language can stem from either strong empirical results or mere rhetorical style, it is often difficult to distinguish between the two. To disentangle rhetorical style from substantive content, we introduce a counterfactual, LLM-based framework: multiple LLM rhetorical personas generate counterfactual writings from the same substantive content, an LLM judge compares them through pairwise evaluations, and the outcomes are aggregated using a Bradley--Terry model. Applying this method to 8,485 ICLR submissions sampled from 2017 to 2025, we generate more than 250,000 counterfactual writings and provide a large-scale quantification of rhetorical style in ML papers. We find that visionary framing significantly predicts downstream attention, including citations and media attention, even after controlling for peer-review evaluations. We also observe a sharp rise in rhetorical strength after 2023, and provide empirical evidence showing that this increase is largely driven by the adoption of LLM-based writing assistance. The reliability of our framework is validated by its robustness to the choice of personas and the high correlation between LLM judgments and human annotations. Our work demonstrates that LLMs can serve as instruments to measure and improve scientific evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在对话系统中虽表现流畅自然，但常带有过度礼貌、乐观或谨慎等语气偏见，影响用户对信任、共情和公平性的感知，亟需识别和管理此类隐性行为特征。

Method: 结合可控大语言模型对话生成与预训练的DistilBERT语气分类模型，构建两组合成对话数据集（中性与正/负向引导），采用弱监督方式标注语气，训练并比较多种分类器，最终使用集成模型进行语气偏差检测。

Result: 即便在中性提示下，生成的对话仍表现出一致的语气偏向；基于弱监督的分类模型，集成方法达到最高0.92的宏F1分数，证明语气偏见具有系统性、可测量性，并对对话AI的伦理设计具有重要意义。

Conclusion: 语气偏见是大语言模型中一种系统性、可检测的行为特征，其根源可能在于模型的内在对话风格。通过融合可控生成与分类技术，可有效识别并量化该偏见，为构建更公平、可信的对话人工智能提供关键支持。

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly used in conversational systems such as digital personal assistants, shaping how people interact with technology through language. While their responses often sound fluent and natural, they can also carry subtle tone biases such as sounding overly polite, cheerful, or cautious even when neutrality is expected. These tendencies can influence how users perceive trust, empathy, and fairness in dialogue. In this study, we explore tone bias as a hidden behavioral trait of large language models. The novelty of this research lies in the integration of controllable large language model based dialogue synthesis with tone classification models, enabling robust and ethical emotion recognition in personal assistant interactions. We created two synthetic dialogue datasets, one generated from neutral prompts and another explicitly guided to produce positive or negative tones. Surprisingly, even the neutral set showed consistent tonal skew, suggesting that bias may stem from the model's underlying conversational style. Using weak supervision through a pretrained DistilBERT model, we labeled tones and trained several classifiers to detect these patterns. Ensemble models achieved macro F1 scores up to 0.92, showing that tone bias is systematic, measurable, and relevant to designing fair and trustworthy conversational AI.

TL;DR: 该论文提出ThinkARM框架，基于Schoenfeld的剧集理论，将大语言模型的推理轨迹抽象为分析、探索、实施、验证等功能性推理步骤，揭示了推理模型与非推理模型在思维动态和结构上的差异，且这些差异在词元层面无法察觉。通过两个诊断案例，发现探索是影响正确性的关键分支步骤，而效率导向的方法会抑制评估反馈步骤而非简单缩短输出。整体表明，剧集级表示使推理步骤显式化，有助于系统分析现代语言模型中推理的结构、稳定性和变化方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型虽暴露推理过程，但其深层认知结构和步骤仍难以识别与分析，尤其在词元层面无法捕捉本质差异。需要一种能揭示推理内部机制的中间尺度分析框架。

Method: 采用Schoenfeld的剧集理论作为归纳性分析视角，构建ThinkARM框架，将推理轨迹抽象为如分析、探索、实施、验证等功能性步骤，并应用于多种数学问题求解模型进行对比分析。

Result: 抽象后的推理步骤可揭示模型间可复现的思维动态与结构性差异；探索是影响正确性的关键分支步骤；效率优化方法倾向于抑制评估反馈步骤而非统一压缩响应长度。

Conclusion: episode-level（剧集级）表示能够使推理步骤显式化，从而实现对语言模型推理结构、稳定性及演变的系统性分析，为理解大模型内在推理机制提供了新工具。

Abstract: Large language models increasingly expose reasoning traces, yet their underlying cognitive structure and steps remain difficult to identify and analyze beyond surface-level statistics. We adopt Schoenfeld's Episode Theory as an inductive, intermediate-scale lens and introduce ThinkARM (Anatomy of Reasoning in Models), a scalable framework that explicitly abstracts reasoning traces into functional reasoning steps such as Analysis, Explore, Implement, Verify, etc. When applied to mathematical problem solving by diverse models, this abstraction reveals reproducible thinking dynamics and structural differences between reasoning and non-reasoning models, which are not apparent from token-level views. We further present two diagnostic case studies showing that exploration functions as a critical branching step associated with correctness, and that efficiency-oriented methods selectively suppress evaluative feedback steps rather than uniformly shortening responses. Together, our results demonstrate that episode-level representations make reasoning steps explicit, enabling systematic analysis of how reasoning is structured, stabilized, and altered in modern language models.

TL;DR: 提出ABBEL框架，通过自然语言摘要（信念状态）替代长序列交互历史，实现高效记忆管理；结合强化学习优化信念生成与更新，显著提升性能并降低内存占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长序列决策任务中交互历史过长导致的计算不可行问题，需要在保持高效性的同时维持可解释性与性能。

Method: 引入信念瓶颈机制，将多步交互历史压缩为自然语言形式的信念状态；每步先基于最新观测更新信念，再仅依据当前信念选择动作；结合强化学习进行后训练，引入信念评分与长度惩罚以优化信念质量与压缩性。

Result: ABBEL在六种环境上表现出近恒定内存使用和可解释的信念生成；强化学习训练使性能超越全上下文设置，且内存消耗更低。

Conclusion: ABBEL结合强化学习能有效平衡记忆效率与任务性能，是处理长序列决策任务的高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: As the length of sequential decision-making tasks increases, it becomes computationally impractical to keep full interaction histories in context. We introduce a general framework for LLM agents to maintain concise contexts through multi-step interaction: Acting through Belief Bottlenecks Expressed in Language (ABBEL), and methods to further improve ABBEL agents with RL post-training. ABBEL replaces long multi-step interaction history by a belief state, i.e., a natural language summary of what has been discovered about task-relevant unknowns. Under ABBEL, at each step the agent first updates a prior belief with the most recent observation from the environment to form a posterior belief, then uses only the posterior to select an action. We systematically evaluate frontier models under ABBEL across six diverse multi-step environments, finding that ABBEL supports generating interpretable beliefs while maintaining near-constant memory use over interaction steps. However, bottleneck approaches are generally prone to error propagation, which we observe causing inferior performance when compared to the full context setting due to errors in belief updating. Therefore, we train LLMs to generate and act on beliefs within the ABBEL framework via reinforcement learning (RL). We experiment with belief grading, to reward higher quality beliefs, as well as belief length penalties to reward more compressed beliefs. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of RL to improve ABBEL's performance beyond the full context setting, while using less memory than contemporaneous approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态检索增强生成（RAG）在音视频领域面临两大挑战：一是现有多模态知识图谱（MMKG）模态覆盖有限且缺乏多跳连接能力；二是仅依赖共享多模态嵌入空间中的相似度进行检索，难以过滤无关或冗余知识，影响推理质量与答案准确性。

Method: 提出M$^3$KG-RAG框架，包含两个核心组件：1）利用轻量级多智能体系统构建多跳多模态知识图谱（M$^3$KG），包含上下文丰富、跨模态的三元组；2）设计GRASP（Grounded Retrieval And Selective Pruning）机制，实现基于查询的模态特定检索、实体精准对齐、答案支持相关性评估以及冗余知识剪枝，确保仅保留对回答生成必要的知识。

Result: 在多个多模态基准测试中，M$^3$KG-RAG显著提升了多模态大模型在音频-视觉任务中的推理能力与知识对齐精度，相比现有方法在准确率和答案忠实性方面均有明显改善。

Conclusion: M$^3$KG-RAG通过构建结构化、上下文丰富的多跳多模态知识图谱并引入精确的检索与剪枝机制，有效克服了传统多模态RAG在音视频场景下的局限性，为提升多模态大模型的推理深度与可信度提供了新范式。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently been extended to multimodal settings, connecting multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with vast corpora of external knowledge such as multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs). Despite their recent success, multimodal RAG in the audio-visual domain remains challenging due to 1) limited modality coverage and multi-hop connectivity of existing MMKGs, and 2) retrieval based solely on similarity in a shared multimodal embedding space, which fails to filter out off-topic or redundant knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose M$^3$KG-RAG, a Multi-hop Multimodal Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG that retrieves query-aligned audio-visual knowledge from MMKGs, improving reasoning depth and answer faithfulness in MLLMs. Specifically, we devise a lightweight multi-agent pipeline to construct multi-hop MMKG (M$^3$KG), which contains context-enriched triplets of multimodal entities, enabling modality-wise retrieval based on input queries. Furthermore, we introduce GRASP (Grounded Retrieval And Selective Pruning), which ensures precise entity grounding to the query, evaluates answer-supporting relevance, and prunes redundant context to retain only knowledge essential for response generation. Extensive experiments across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that M$^3$KG-RAG significantly enhances MLLMs' multimodal reasoning and grounding over existing approaches.

TL;DR: 本文提出Early Knowledge Alignment (EKA)模块，通过在迭代RAG系统中引入检索语料的上下文相关知识，提升模型在复杂多跳问题上的推理效率与准确性。EKA在不依赖额外训练的情况下显著改善检索精度、减少错误传播，并增强模型对相关信息的聚焦能力。实验表明其在多个标准数据集上表现优异，且具备良好的泛化性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有迭代RAG方法在规划阶段未充分考虑可用检索语料的信息，导致检索与推理链效率低下，容易产生错误累积。为解决这一问题，需要在推理前建立更精准的知识基础。

Method: 提出Early Knowledge Alignment (EKA)模块，在迭代RAG系统的规划阶段之前，将大型语言模型与检索到的相关知识进行对齐，使模型能基于真实可用信息进行有效推理规划。该方法无需额外训练，适用于大规模模型。

Result: 在六个标准RAG数据集上的实验显示，EKA显著提升了检索精度，减少了错误传播，提高了性能与效率。熵分析表明，早期知识对齐降低了不必要的探索，使模型更聚焦于相关知识子集。同时，EKA在不同数据集和检索语料上均表现出强鲁棒性与可扩展性。

Conclusion: EKA是一种简单而有效的训练无关推理策略，能够显著提升迭代RAG系统的表现，揭示了结构化推理与高效探索在强化学习增强框架中的关键作用，推动了该领域的技术进步。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to address knowledge-intensive queries requiring domain-specific or up-to-date information. To handle complex multi-hop questions that are challenging for single-step retrieval, iterative RAG approaches incorporating reinforcement learning have been proposed. However, existing iterative RAG systems typically plan to decompose questions without leveraging information about the available retrieval corpus, leading to inefficient retrieval and reasoning chains that cascade into suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce Early Knowledge Alignment (EKA), a simple but effective module that aligns LLMs with retrieval set before planning in iterative RAG systems with contextually relevant retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments on six standard RAG datasets demonstrate that by establishing a stronger reasoning foundation, EKA significantly improves retrieval precision, reduces cascading errors, and enhances both performance and efficiency. Our analysis from an entropy perspective demonstrate that incorporating early knowledge reduces unnecessary exploration during the reasoning process, enabling the model to focus more effectively on relevant information subsets. Moreover, EKA proves effective as a versatile, training-free inference strategy that scales seamlessly to large models. Generalization tests across diverse datasets and retrieval corpora confirm the robustness of our approach. Overall, EKA advances the state-of-the-art in iterative RAG systems while illuminating the critical interplay between structured reasoning and efficient exploration in reinforcement learning-augmented frameworks.

TL;DR: RetroPrompt 是一种新型的提示学习方法，旨在通过解耦知识与单纯记忆来平衡记忆与泛化能力。它利用公开的知识库和检索机制，在输入、训练和推理阶段动态获取相关上下文信息，从而减少对机械记忆的依赖，提升模型在零样本和少样本场景下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统提示学习方法仍遵循参数化学习范式，容易导致记忆不稳定性，难以充分利用异常样本，并在小样本情况下易过拟合于浅层模式。因此需要一种新方法来增强泛化能力并减少对记忆的依赖。

Method: RetroPrompt 通过引入一个从训练数据生成的公开知识库，并在输入、训练和推理阶段集成检索机制，使模型能够主动从语料库中检索相关上下文信息，以增强线索表示，实现记忆与泛化的平衡。

Result: 在多个自然语言处理和计算机视觉任务的数据集上，RetroPrompt 在零样本和少样本设置下均表现出优越性能。分析表明，该方法显著降低了对机械记忆的依赖，提升了模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RetroPrompt 通过引入外部知识检索机制，有效缓解了传统提示学习中的过拟合与记忆依赖问题，为少样本学习提供了更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: The pre-trained foundation models (PFMs) have become essential for facilitating large-scale multimodal learning. Researchers have effectively employed the ``pre-train, prompt, and predict'' paradigm through prompt learning to induce improved few-shot performance. However, prompt learning approaches for PFMs still follow a parametric learning paradigm. As such, the stability of generalization in memorization and rote learning can be compromised. More specifically, conventional prompt learning might face difficulties in fully utilizing atypical instances and avoiding overfitting to shallow patterns with limited data during the process of fully-supervised training. To overcome these constraints, we present our approach, named RetroPrompt, which aims to achieve a balance between memorization and generalization by decoupling knowledge from mere memorization. Unlike traditional prompting methods, RetroPrompt leverages a publicly accessible knowledge base generated from the training data and incorporates a retrieval mechanism throughout the input, training, and inference stages. This enables the model to actively retrieve relevant contextual information from the corpus, thereby enhancing the available cues. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a variety of datasets across natural language processing and computer vision tasks to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach, RetroPrompt, in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Through detailed analysis of memorization patterns, we observe that RetroPrompt effectively reduces the reliance on rote memorization, leading to enhanced generalization.

Abstract: Recent advancements in joint speech-text models show great potential for seamless voice interactions. However, existing models face critical challenges: temporal resolution mismatch between speech tokens (25Hz) and text tokens (~3Hz) dilutes semantic information, incurs high computational costs, and causes catastrophic forgetting of text LLM knowledge. We introduce Fun-Audio-Chat, a Large Audio Language Model addressing these limitations via two innovations from our previous work DrVoice. First, Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR): the Shared LLM processes audio at efficient 5Hz (via token grouping), while the Speech Refined Head generates high-quality tokens at 25Hz, balancing efficiency (~50% GPU reduction) and quality. Second, Core-Cocktail Training, a two-stage fine-tuning with intermediate merging that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. We then apply Multi-Task DPO Training to enhance robustness, audio understanding, instruction-following and voice empathy. This multi-stage post-training enables Fun-Audio-Chat to retain text LLM knowledge while gaining powerful audio understanding, reasoning, and generation. Unlike recent LALMs requiring large-scale audio-text pre-training, Fun-Audio-Chat leverages pre-trained models and extensive post-training. Fun-Audio-Chat 8B and MoE 30B-A3B achieve competitive performance on Speech-to-Text and Speech-to-Speech tasks, ranking top among similar-scale models on Spoken QA benchmarks. They also achieve competitive to superior performance on Audio Understanding, Speech Function Calling, Instruction-Following and Voice Empathy. We develop Fun-Audio-Chat-Duplex, a full-duplex variant with strong performance on Spoken QA and full-duplex interactions. We open-source Fun-Audio-Chat-8B with training and inference code, and provide an interactive demo.

Abstract: Recognizing whether outputs from large language models (LLMs) contain faithfulness hallucination is crucial for real-world applications, e.g., retrieval-augmented generation and summarization. In this paper, we introduce FaithLens, a cost-efficient and effective faithfulness hallucination detection model that can jointly provide binary predictions and corresponding explanations to improve trustworthiness. To achieve this, we first synthesize training data with explanations via advanced LLMs and apply a well-defined data filtering strategy to ensure label correctness, explanation quality, and data diversity. Subsequently, we fine-tune the model on these well-curated training data as a cold start and further optimize it with rule-based reinforcement learning, using rewards for both prediction correctness and explanation quality. Results on 12 diverse tasks show that the 8B-parameter FaithLens outperforms advanced models such as GPT-4.1 and o3.

Abstract: Speech processing and translation technology have the potential to facilitate meetings of individuals who do not share any common language. To evaluate automatic systems for such a task, a versatile and realistic evaluation corpus is needed. Therefore, we create and present a corpus of cross-lingual dialogues between individuals without a common language who were facilitated by automatic simultaneous speech translation. The corpus consists of 5 hours of speech recordings with ASR and gold transcripts in 12 original languages and automatic and corrected translations into English. For the purposes of research into cross-lingual summarization, our corpus also includes written summaries (minutes) of the meetings.
  Moreover, we propose automatic detection of misunderstandings. For an overview of this task and its complexity, we attempt to quantify misunderstandings in cross-lingual meetings. We annotate misunderstandings manually and also test the ability of current large language models to detect them automatically. The results show that the Gemini model is able to identify text spans with misunderstandings with recall of 77% and precision of 47%.

Abstract: Automatic presentation slide generation can greatly streamline content creation. However, since preferences of each user may vary, existing under-specified formulations often lead to suboptimal results that fail to align with individual user needs. We introduce a novel task that conditions paper-to-slides generation on user-specified preferences. We propose a human behavior-inspired agentic framework, SlideTailor, that progressively generates editable slides in a user-aligned manner. Instead of requiring users to write their preferences in detailed textual form, our system only asks for a paper-slides example pair and a visual template - natural and easy-to-provide artifacts that implicitly encode rich user preferences across content and visual style. Despite the implicit and unlabeled nature of these inputs, our framework effectively distills and generalizes the preferences to guide customized slide generation. We also introduce a novel chain-of-speech mechanism to align slide content with planned oral narration. Such a design significantly enhances the quality of generated slides and enables downstream applications like video presentations. To support this new task, we construct a benchmark dataset that captures diverse user preferences, with carefully designed interpretable metrics for robust evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show impressive performance on many NLP benchmarks, yet their ability to reason in figurative, culturally grounded, and low-resource settings remains underexplored. We address this gap for Bangla by introducing BanglaRiddleEval, a benchmark of 1,244 traditional Bangla riddles instantiated across four tasks (4,976 riddle-task artifacts in total). Using an LLM-based pipeline, we generate Chain-of-Thought explanations, semantically coherent distractors, and fine-grained ambiguity annotations, and evaluate a diverse suite of open-source and closed-source models under different prompting strategies. Models achieve moderate semantic overlap on generative QA but low correctness, MCQ accuracy peaks at only about 56% versus an 83% human baseline, and ambiguity resolution ranges from roughly 26% to 68%, with high-quality explanations confined to the strongest models. These results show that current LLMs capture some cues needed for Bangla riddle reasoning but remain far from human-level performance, establishing BanglaRiddleEval as a challenging new benchmark for low-resource figurative reasoning.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of unstructured data from social media, reviews, and forums, text mining has become essential in Information Systems (IS) for extracting actionable insights. Summarization can condense fragmented, emotion-rich posts, but existing methods-optimized for structured news-struggle with noisy, informal content. Emotional cues are critical for IS tasks such as brand monitoring and market analysis, yet few studies integrate sentiment modeling into summarization of short user-generated texts. We propose a sentiment-aware framework extending extractive (TextRank) and abstractive (UniLM) approaches by embedding sentiment signals into ranking and generation processes. This dual design improves the capture of emotional nuances and thematic relevance, producing concise, sentiment-enriched summaries that enhance timely interventions and strategic decision-making in dynamic online environments.

Abstract: Distilling pretrained softmax attention Transformers into more efficient hybrid architectures that interleave softmax and linear attention layers is a promising approach for improving the inference efficiency of LLMs without requiring expensive pretraining from scratch. A critical factor in the conversion process is layer selection, i.e., deciding on which layers to convert to linear attention variants. This paper describes a simple and efficient recipe for layer selection that uses layer importance scores derived from a small amount of training on generic text data. Once the layers have been selected we use a recent pipeline for the distillation process itself \citep[RADLADS;][]{goldstein2025radlads}, which consists of attention weight transfer, hidden state alignment, KL-based distribution matching, followed by a small amount of finetuning. We find that this approach is more effective than existing approaches for layer selection, including heuristics that uniformly interleave linear attentions based on a fixed ratio, as well as more involved approaches that rely on specialized diagnostic datasets.

TL;DR: Gnosis 是一种轻量级的自知机制，使冻结的大语言模型能够通过分析推理过程中的隐藏状态和注意力模式来实现内在自我验证。它无需外部裁判或大量计算，仅增加约500万参数，就能高效预测生成结果的正确性，在数学推理、开放域问答和学术知识等多个基准上表现优于现有方法，并支持零样本泛化和早期失败检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然能生成流畅复杂的输出，但常无法识别自身错误和幻觉；现有方法依赖外部裁判、多样本一致性或文本自评，存在计算成本高或与真实正确性关联弱的问题。因此需要探索是否可通过分析模型内部状态实现自我验证。

Method: Gnosis 被动观察生成过程中的内部痕迹，将隐藏状态和注意力模式压缩为固定预算的描述符，利用这些描述符预测输出正确性，整个过程对序列长度不敏感，计算开销极低。

Result: 在多个任务和不同规模的冻结模型（1.7B 到 20B 参数）上，Gnosis 在准确率和校准性方面均优于强基线和大型外部裁判；且可零样本泛化至部分生成，实现早期失败检测与计算资源控制。

Conclusion: 可靠的真实性线索存在于生成过程中，可通过高效方式从内部状态中提取，无需外部监督，证明了大语言模型具备内在自我验证的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent and complex outputs but often fail to recognize their own mistakes and hallucinations. Existing approaches typically rely on external judges, multi-sample consistency, or text-based self-critique, which incur additional compute or correlate weakly with true correctness. We ask: can LLMs predict their own failures by inspecting internal states during inference? We introduce Gnosis, a lightweight self-awareness mechanism that enables frozen LLMs to perform intrinsic self-verification by decoding signals from hidden states and attention patterns. Gnosis passively observes internal traces, compresses them into fixed-budget descriptors, and predicts correctness with negligible inference cost, adding only ~5M parameters and operating independently of sequence length. Across math reasoning, open-domain question answering, and academic knowledge benchmarks, and over frozen backbones ranging from 1.7B to 20B parameters, Gnosis consistently outperforms strong internal baselines and large external judges in both accuracy and calibration. Moreover, it generalizes zero-shot to partial generations, enabling early detection of failing trajectories and compute-aware control. These results show that reliable correctness cues are intrinsic to generation process and can be extracted efficiently without external supervision.

### [68] [Cube Bench: A Benchmark for Spatial Visual Reasoning in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20595)
*Dhruv Anand,Ehsan Shareghi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cube Bench 是一个用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）空间与序列推理能力的魔方基准测试。该基准将性能分解为五项技能：从图像和文本重建魔方面、选择最优下一步动作、预测候选动作的结果而不实际执行、在出错后执行多步计划并恢复，以及自我检测与修正错误。通过统一的打乱状态、提示和解析器，以及单一的“距离解法”度量标准，对七种 MLLMs 进行横向比较。结果显示，随着打乱深度增加，模型准确率急剧下降；一旦轨迹停滞或偏离，模型很少能恢复；高面重建准确率并不保证动作选择或多步执行能力。封闭源代码模型在单步感知和多步控制任务上均表现领先，而开源模型在最复杂场景中接近随机水平；即便最强模型在高复杂度下也表现下降。简单的自我修正通过反思思维带来小幅提升，但可能导致过度思考。Cube Bench 提供了一个紧凑、可复现的序列空间推理探测工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估多模态大语言模型在空间与序列推理方面的能力，特别是其在复杂、动态任务中的表现，如魔方求解，以揭示模型在长期规划、错误修复和自主修正方面的局限性。

Method: 构建一个基于魔方的标准化基准测试（Cube Bench），包含五项核心技能评估维度，使用统一的打乱状态、提示模板和解析器，并以“距离解法”作为唯一度量标准，对七种 MLLMs 进行系统性对比实验。

Result: 模型准确率随魔方打乱深度显著下降；多数模型在轨迹偏离后无法恢复；高面重建能力不等于强动作选择或多步执行能力；封闭源代码模型整体优于开源模型，但在高复杂度下仍表现退化；简单自我修正带来轻微提升，但可能引发过度思考。

Conclusion: Cube Bench 为评估 MLLMs 的序列空间推理能力提供了一个紧凑、可复现且有效的基准，揭示了当前模型在长期规划、错误恢复与自主修正上的关键瓶颈。

Abstract: We introduce Cube Bench, a Rubik's-cube benchmark for evaluating spatial and sequential reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The benchmark decomposes performance into five skills: (i) reconstructing cube faces from images and text, (ii) choosing the optimal next move, (iii) predicting the outcome of a candidate move without applying it, (iv) executing multi-step plans while recovering from mistakes, and (v) detecting and revising one's own errors. Using a shared set of scrambled cube states, identical prompts and parsers, and a single distance-to-solved metric, we compare recent MLLMs side by side as a function of scramble depth. Across seven MLLMs, accuracy drops sharply with depth; once a trajectory stalls or diverges, models rarely recover, and high face-reconstruction accuracy does not guarantee competent action selection or multi-step execution. A pronounced closed- vs open-source gap emerges: the strongest closed model leads on both single-step perception tasks and multi-step control tasks, while open-weight models cluster near chance on the hardest settings; yet even the best MLLM degrades at higher cube complexity. A simple self-correction via reflective thinking yields modest gains but can also introduce overthinking. Cube Bench offers a compact, reproducible probe of sequential spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: We present MoE-DiffuSeq, a mixture of experts based framework for enhancing diffusion models in long document generation. Existing diffusion based text generation models, such as DiffuSeq, suffer from high computational cost and memory overhead when applied to extended sequences. To address these challenges, MoE-DiffuSeq integrates sparse attention with a mixture of experts architecture, enabling efficient and scalable long sequence modeling. Our approach introduces a customized sparse attention mechanism designed to reduce computational complexity while preserving text quality and coherence. In addition, we incorporate a soft absorbing state within the diffusion process to accelerate sequence reconstruction and improve generation precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoE-DiffuSeq significantly improves training efficiency and sampling speed compared to existing diffusion models. These advantages are particularly effective for long document scenarios, including scientific article generation, code repository modeling, and long form dialogue generation. Benchmark results further show that MoE-DiffuSeq improves efficiency, speed, accuracy, and expressiveness, advancing the practical applicability of diffusion models for high quality long form text generation.

Abstract: The rapid growth of cloud computing in the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) industry has created a critical need for resource and job lifetime prediction to achieve optimal scheduling. Traditional machine learning methods often struggle with the complexity and heterogeneity of EDA workloads, requiring extensive feature engineering and domain expertise. We propose a novel framework that fine-tunes Large Language Models (LLMs) to address this challenge through text-to-text regression. We introduce the scientific notation and prefix filling to constrain the LLM, significantly improving output format reliability. Moreover, we found that full-attention finetuning and inference improves the prediction accuracy of sliding-window-attention LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework on real-world cloud datasets, setting a new baseline for performance prediction in the EDA domain.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了可穿戴设备上人体活动识别（HAR）中不同监督范式的表现，重点提出减少标注需求同时保持高准确率的新方法。比较了六种方法：全监督、基础无监督、带约束的弱监督、多任务学习、基于领域知识的自监督，以及一种新型弱自监督框架。实验表明，弱监督方法在显著降低标注需求的同时达到接近全监督的性能；多任务学习通过知识共享提升表现；而新提出的弱自监督方法仅需10%标注数据即表现出卓越效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HAR方法在性能与标注成本之间存在权衡：全监督方法准确率高但需大量标注数据，无监督方法无需标注但性能较差。为解决这一矛盾，亟需开发在有限标注下仍具高准确率的新方法，尤其适用于标注资源受限的实际场景。

Conclusion: 不同学习范式在HAR中各有优势，可根据标注数据可用性灵活选择。所提出的弱自监督框架在低标注条件下表现优异，是实际应用中极具前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors has advanced through various machine learning paradigms, each with inherent trade-offs between performance and labeling requirements. While fully supervised techniques achieve high accuracy, they demand extensive labeled datasets that are costly to obtain. Conversely, unsupervised methods eliminate labeling needs but often deliver suboptimal performance. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation across the supervision spectrum for wearable-based HAR, with particular focus on novel approaches that minimize labeling requirements while maintaining competitive accuracy. We develop and empirically compare: (1) traditional fully supervised learning, (2) basic unsupervised learning, (3) a weakly supervised learning approach with constraints, (4) a multi-task learning approach with knowledge sharing, (5) a self-supervised approach based on domain expertise, and (6) a novel weakly self-supervised learning framework that leverages domain knowledge and minimal labeled data. Experiments across benchmark datasets demonstrate that: (i) our weakly supervised methods achieve performance comparable to fully supervised approaches while significantly reducing supervision requirements; (ii) the proposed multi-task framework enhances performance through knowledge sharing between related tasks; (iii) our weakly self-supervised approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency with just 10\% of labeled data. These results not only highlight the complementary strengths of different learning paradigms, offering insights into tailoring HAR solutions based on the availability of labeled data, but also establish that our novel weakly self-supervised framework offers a promising solution for practical HAR applications where labeled data are limited.

*Zhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ICFA是一种针对大规模候选空间中稀有但有用解的搜索框架，通过目标条件重加权实现聚焦采样，利用已有提议采样器和任务特定相似性函数形成聚焦分布，并自适应控制聚焦强度以避免退化。该方法提供了一套清晰的实践指南、基于有效样本量的稳定性诊断、理论分析以及两个可复现实验：受限语言生成和稀疏奖励导航。此外，还展示了结构化提示如何实现近似语言层面的ICFA，并提出结合提示推理与算法重加权的混合架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在语言生成、规划和强化学习等领域，从巨大候选空间中找到稀有但有用的解是一个常见挑战。传统方法在高维或复杂空间中效率低下，因此需要一种更高效且稳定的搜索机制来聚焦于潜在优质解。

Method: 提出一种名为"逆因果聚焦算法"（ICFA）的框架，将搜索建模为一个目标条件重加权过程。该方法重用现有提议采样器和任务相关的相似性函数，构建聚焦采样分布，并通过有效样本量监控自适应调节聚焦强度，防止分布退化。

Result: ICFA在两个实验中表现出色：在受限语言生成任务中提升生成质量，在稀疏奖励导航任务中显著减少所需样本数。理论分析表明，在某些条件下，该方法可有效降低样本需求。结构化提示被证明能近似实现ICFA功能，而混合架构进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: ICFA提供了一种实用、稳定且可扩展的搜索框架，适用于多种生成与决策任务，尤其在样本稀缺或空间庞大的场景下具有显著优势。其与提示工程的结合也为大模型应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Finding rare but useful solutions in very large candidate spaces is a recurring practical challenge across language generation, planning, and reinforcement learning. We present a practical framework, \emph{Inverted Causality Focusing Algorithm} (ICFA), that treats search as a target-conditioned reweighting process. ICFA reuses an available proposal sampler and a task-specific similarity function to form a focused sampling distribution, while adaptively controlling focusing strength to avoid degeneracy. We provide a clear recipe, a stability diagnostic based on effective sample size, a compact theoretical sketch explaining when ICFA can reduce sample needs, and two reproducible experiments: constrained language generation and sparse-reward navigation. We further show how structured prompts instantiate an approximate, language-level form of ICFA and describe a hybrid architecture combining prompted inference with algorithmic reweighting.

Conclusion: 该方法为频繁模型更新提供了高效、轻量、即插即用的解决方案，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低存储与启动成本，具有良好的实际应用前景。

Abstract: Serving many task-specialized LLM variants is often limited by the large size of fine-tuned checkpoints and the resulting cold-start latency. Since fine-tuned weights differ from their base model by relatively small structured residuals, a natural approach is to represent them as compressed deltas. We propose a simple 1-bit delta scheme that stores only the sign of the weight difference together with lightweight per-axis (row/column) FP16 scaling factors, learned from a small calibration set. This design preserves the compactness of 1-bit deltas while more accurately capturing variation across weight dimensions, leading to improved reconstruction quality over scalar alternatives. From a systems perspective, a streamlined loader that transfers packed deltas in a single operation per module reduces cold-start latency and storage overhead, with artifacts several times smaller than a full FP16 checkpoint. The method is drop-in, requires minimal calibration data, and maintains inference efficiency by avoiding dense reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有重叠度量方法局限于非负信号，无法处理带符号的实值或复值信号，限制了其在科学与金融等领域中的广泛应用。因此需要一种能兼容任意实/复信号、保留良好数学性质（如度量性、正半定性）并具备可解释性的统一框架。

Method: 将信号建模为带符号状态空间上的原子测度，采用正负分裂（实信号）、笛卡尔/极坐标分解（复信号）或用户自定义状态划分进行多状态嵌入；基于嵌入后的非负表示，应用Tanimoto公式构造[0,1]距离；通过莫比乌斯反演实现信号幅度的可加贡献分解；归一化嵌入以获得概率测度，进而建立总变差的单调关系与模式-强度分解机制。

Result: 成功构建了一个统一的符号感知框架，能够处理实值与复值信号，生成满足三角不等式的有界距离，定义正半定核，支持概率解释与预算闭合的贡献分析，适用于相关图、特征工程、图学习等多种分析任务。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架在理论上完备，在实践中通用，为多类型信号提供了统一、可解释且可直接应用于机器学习与数据分析的相似性度量工具。

Abstract: We introduce a sign-aware, multistate Jaccard/Tanimoto framework that extends overlap-based distances from nonnegative vectors and measures to arbitrary real- and complex-valued signals while retaining bounded metric and positive-semidefinite kernel structure. Formally, the construction is a set- and measure-theoretic geometry: signals are represented as atomic measures on a signed state space, and similarity is given by a generalized Jaccard overlap of these measures. Each signal is embedded into a nonnegative multistate representation, using positive/negative splits for real signals, Cartesian and polar decompositions for complex signals, and user-defined state partitions for refined regime analysis. Applying the Tanimoto construction to these embeddings yields a family of $[0,1]$ distances that satisfy the triangle inequality and define positive-semidefinite kernels usable directly in kernel methods and graph-based learning. Beyond pairwise distances, we develop coalition analysis via Möbius inversion, which decomposes signal magnitude into nonnegative, additive contributions with exact budget closure across coalitions of signals. Normalizing the same embeddings produces probability measures on coordinate -- state configurations, so that the distance becomes a monotone transform of total variation and admits a regime -- intensity decomposition. The resulting construction yields a single, mechanistically interpretable distance that simultaneously provides bounded metric structure, positive-semidefinite kernels, probabilistic semantics, and transparent budget accounting within one sign-aware framework, supporting correlograms, feature engineering, similarity graphs, and other analytical tools in scientific and financial applications.

Abstract: This work introduces a methodology to adjust forecasts based on node-specific cost function asymmetry. The proposed model generates savings by dynamically incorporating the cost asymmetry into the forecasting error probability distribution to favor the least expensive scenario. Savings are calculated and a self-regulation mechanism modulates the adjustments magnitude based on the observed savings, enabling the model to adapt to station-specific conditions and unmodeled factors such as calibration errors or shifting macroeconomic dynamics. Finally, empirical results demonstrate the model's ability to achieve \$5.1M annual savings.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel end-to-end framework that efficiently integrates data quality assessment with machine learning (ML) model operations in real-time production environments. While existing approaches treat data quality assessment and ML systems as isolated processes, our framework addresses the critical gap between theoretical methods and practical implementation by combining dynamic drift detection, adaptive data quality metrics, and MLOps into a cohesive, lightweight system. The key innovation lies in its operational efficiency, enabling real-time, quality-driven ML decision-making with minimal computational overhead. We validate the framework in a steel manufacturing company's Electroslag Remelting (ESR) vacuum pumping process, demonstrating a 12% improvement in model performance (R2 = 94%) and a fourfold reduction in prediction latency. By exploring the impact of data quality acceptability thresholds, we provide actionable insights into balancing data quality standards and predictive performance in industrial applications. This framework represents a significant advancement in MLOps, offering a robust solution for time-sensitive, data-driven decision-making in dynamic industrial environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨了机器学习模型在现实世界应用中面临的挑战，强调了持续学习（Continual Learning, CL）和分布外检测（Out-of-Distribution, OOD）的重要性。随着数据随时间变化和新类型输入频繁出现，传统假设训练与测试数据独立同分布（i.i.d.）已不再适用。重新训练模型成本高昂且不切实际，因此需要能够增量学习并避免遗忘旧知识的持续学习方法，同时具备识别异常或新颖输入的能力。联合解决这两类问题对构建鲁棒、高效、自适应的人工智能系统至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的机器学习应用面临数据动态变化、新样本不断出现的问题，而传统模型依赖于i.i.d.假设，难以应对分布漂移和未知输入。重新训练模型代价高，无法满足实时性和资源限制需求，因此亟需一种能持续适应新数据且能识别异常输入的智能系统。

Method: 提出结合持续学习（CL）与分布外检测（OOD）的方法，使模型能够在不遗忘已有知识的前提下，逐步学习新数据，并有效识别超出训练分布的输入。

Conclusion: 持续学习与分布外检测的联合框架是构建可适应、可信赖人工智能系统的关键方向，未来应进一步探索其在复杂真实场景中的集成与优化。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant progress in the development of machine learning models across a wide range of fields, fueled by increased computational resources, large-scale datasets, and the rise of deep learning architectures. From malware detection to enabling autonomous navigation, modern machine learning systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. However, as these models are deployed in ever-changing real-world scenarios, their ability to remain reliable and adaptive over time becomes increasingly important. For example, in the real world, new malware families are continuously developed, whereas autonomous driving cars are employed in many different cities and weather conditions. Models trained in fixed settings can not respond effectively to novel conditions encountered post-deployment. In fact, most machine learning models are still developed under the assumption that training and test data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), i.e., sampled from the same underlying (unknown) distribution. While this assumption simplifies model development and evaluation, it does not hold in many real-world applications, where data changes over time and unexpected inputs frequently occur. Retraining models from scratch whenever new data appears is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and impractical in resource-constrained environments. These limitations underscore the need for Continual Learning (CL), which enables models to incrementally learn from evolving data streams without forgetting past knowledge, and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, which allows systems to identify and respond to novel or anomalous inputs. Jointly addressing both challenges is critical to developing robust, efficient, and adaptive AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在数学推理中常因链式思维（CoT）中的细微逻辑、代数或数值错误而失败，但传统后训练方法仅以正确/错误二元判断处理，忽略结构性缺陷；同时基于人类反馈强化学习（RLHF）等方法成本高、难以扩展且不稳定，亟需一种高效、可解释且低成本的改进方案。

Method: 从MetaMathQA风格的链式思维数据进行监督微调（SFT）出发，引入一个轻量级的MathVerifier模块，将解题过程分解为六维误差特征，输出错误度与荒谬度评分；利用这些评分挖掘近似正确但有结构性缺陷的难例负样本，并构建样本重要性权重；将此信息融入离线直接偏好优化（DPO）目标，形成验证器引导的加权DPO策略。

Result: 在1.5B参数的Qwen2.5模型上，验证器引导的加权DPO显著优于标准SFT和未加权DPO，尤其在解题结果数值接近正确但逻辑不一致的问题上表现更优；同时避免了训练大型奖励模型或依赖外部评委带来的开销，具备良好的可扩展性与实用性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的验证器引导的加权DPO框架是一种高效、可解释且低成本的后训练方法，能够有效识别并修复大语言模型数学推理中的结构性错误，在现实计算条件下具有较强应用潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle with mathematical reasoning, and common post-training pipelines often reduce each generated solution to a binary outcome: correct or incorrect. This perspective is limiting in practice, as failures in chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning are frequently structured; solutions may appear convincing while containing subtle logical, algebraic, or numerical flaws. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) variants that rely on large reward models or LLM-as-a-judge signals are often expensive, difficult to scale, and unstable to iterate. We propose a lightweight and pragmatic post-training pipeline that targets such structured errors under realistic compute budgets. Starting from supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on MetaMathQA-style CoT data, we introduce a compact MathVerifier that decomposes a candidate solution into a six-dimensional error profile and aggregates it into interpretable wrongness and absurdity scores. These verifier signals serve two roles: (i) mining hard negatives that are near-correct yet structurally flawed, and (ii) defining per-sample importance weights that emphasize the most informative preference pairs. We integrate both into an offline Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) objective via a verifier-guided weighted formulation. Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter Qwen2.5 model show that verifier-guided, weighted DPO yields more targeted improvements than vanilla SFT and unweighted DPO, particularly on problems where solutions are numerically close to correct but logically inconsistent, while avoiding the overhead of training large reward models or relying on external judges.

Abstract: Diffusion models can learn rich representations during data generation, showing potential for Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), but they face a trade-off between generative quality and discriminative performance. Their iterative sampling also incurs substantial computational and energy costs, hindering industrial and edge AI applications. To address these issues, we propose the Flow Matching-based Foundation Model (FlowFM), which jointly trains a representation encoder and a conditional flow matching generator. This decoupled design achieves both high-fidelity generation and effective recognition. By using flow matching to learn a simpler velocity field, FlowFM accelerates and stabilizes training, improving its efficiency for representation learning. Experiments on wearable sensor data show FlowFM reduces training time by 50.4\% compared to a diffusion-based approach. On downstream tasks, FlowFM surpassed the state-of-the-art SSL method (SSL-Wearables) on all five datasets while achieving up to a 51.0x inference speedup and maintaining high generative quality.

Conclusion: ArcGen通过提取架构不变的对齐特征，有效解决了现有方法在新架构上泛化能力不足的问题，为黑盒后门检测提供了更可靠、更具通用性的解决方案。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to the security and reliability of deep learning models. To mitigate such attacks, one promising approach is to learn to extract features from the target model and use these features for backdoor detection. However, we discover that existing learning-based neural backdoor detection methods do not generalize well to new architectures not seen during the learning phase. In this paper, we analyze the root cause of this issue and propose a novel black-box neural backdoor detection method called ArcGen. Our method aims to obtain architecture-invariant model features, i.e., aligned features, for effective backdoor detection. Specifically, in contrast to existing methods directly using model outputs as model features, we introduce an additional alignment layer in the feature extraction function to further process these features. This reduces the direct influence of architecture information on the features. Then, we design two alignment losses to train the feature extraction function. These losses explicitly require that features from models with similar backdoor behaviors but different architectures are aligned at both the distribution and sample levels. With these techniques, our method demonstrates up to 42.5% improvements in detection performance (e.g., AUC) on unseen model architectures. This is based on a large-scale evaluation involving 16,896 models trained on diverse datasets, subjected to various backdoor attacks, and utilizing different model architectures. Our code is available at https://github.com/SeRAlab/ArcGen.

### [81] [Leakage-Aware Bandgap Prediction on the JARVIS-DFT Dataset: A Phase-Wise Feature Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19732)
*Gaurav Kumar Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究对JARVIS-DFT带隙数据集进行了系统分析，识别并移除了可能无意中编码能带结构信息的描述符（如有效质量），从而获得一个经过筛选、无泄漏的2280个材料子集。基于该数据集，构建了三阶段建模框架，逐步引入基本物理描述符、工程特征和组成属性。结果表明，树模型在各阶段均达到约0.88至0.90的R²值，说明在控制泄漏的前提下，扩展描述符空间对预测精度提升有限。SHAP分析一致显示介电张量分量是主要贡献因素。本工作为未来泄漏感知的带隙预测研究提供了经筛选的数据集和基准性能指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有带隙预测研究中可能存在描述符泄露问题，即某些描述符间接包含目标变量（如带隙）的信息，导致模型性能被高估。因此需要建立无泄漏的基准数据集和评估框架，以推动更可靠的机器学习模型发展。

Method: 通过系统分析JARVIS-DFT带隙数据集，识别并剔除可能编码能带结构信息的描述符（如有效质量）。构建三阶段建模框架：第一阶段使用基础物理描述符，第二阶段加入工程化特征，第三阶段引入组成属性。采用树基模型进行预测，并利用SHAP进行特征重要性分析。

Result: 在控制泄漏的情况下，树模型在所有阶段均实现R²值约为0.88–0.90，表明扩展描述符空间对预测性能提升不显著。SHAP分析确认介电张量分量为最关键特征。

Conclusion: 本研究成功构建了一个无泄漏的带隙预测基准数据集，揭示了当前模型性能受限于数据本身而非特征丰富度，强调了在材料机器学习中控制描述符泄露的重要性，并为后续研究提供了可靠起点。

Abstract: In this study, we perform a systematic analysis of the JARVIS-DFT bandgap dataset and identify and remove descriptors that may inadvertently encode band-structure information, such as effective masses. This process yields a curated, leakage-controlled subset of 2280 materials. Using this dataset, a three-phase modeling framework is implemented that incrementally incorporates basic physical descriptors, engineered features, and compositional attributes. The results show that tree-based models achieve R2 values of approximately 0.88 to 0.90 across all phases, indicating that expanding the descriptor space does not substantially improve predictive accuracy when leakage is controlled. SHAP analysis consistently identifies the dielectric tensor components as the dominant contributors. This work provides a curated dataset and baseline performance metrics for future leakage-aware bandgap prediction studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在ICU死亡风险预测中虽表现良好，但存在性别、年龄、种族等人口学因素相关的偏差，影响其临床可信度；而现有去偏方法常以牺牲预测性能为代价，难以兼顾公平与准确。因此亟需一种无需重训练、能同时提升公平性与性能的解决方案。

Method: 提出一种名为CAse Prompting（CAP）的新型提示框架，结合传统去偏提示与基于案例的推理机制。通过检索并引入历史上类似患者的误判案例及其正确结果，引导模型纠正偏见推理路径。采用多维偏差评估体系对模型进行全面诊断，并在不修改模型参数的前提下实现公平性与性能的协同优化。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上，CAP显著提升预测性能：AUROC从0.806升至0.873，AUPRC从0.497升至0.694；同时将性别和种族相关偏差降低超过90%。特征注意力分析显示不同人群间注意力模式高度一致（相似度>0.98），表明模型推理过程更具公平性。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在ICU死亡风险预测中确实存在可测量的偏差。通过设计合理的提示策略，可在不重新训练模型的情况下，有效协同优化公平性与预测性能，为临床决策支持系统提供了一种可迁移、高效、可信的去偏新范式。

Abstract: Accurate mortality risk prediction for intensive care unit (ICU) patients is essential for clinical decision-making. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in predicting outcomes from structured medical data, their predictions may exhibit demographic biases related to sex, age, and race, limiting their trustworthy use in clinical practice. Existing debiasing methods often reduce predictive performance, making it difficult to jointly optimize fairness and accuracy. In this study, we systematically examine bias in LLM-based ICU mortality prediction and propose a training-free, clinically adaptive prompting framework to simultaneously improve fairness and performance. We first develop a multi-dimensional bias assessment scheme for comprehensive model diagnosis. Building on this analysis, we introduce CAse Prompting (CAP), a novel prompting framework that integrates conventional debiasing prompts with case-based reasoning. CAP guides the model to learn from similar historical misprediction cases and their correct outcomes, enabling correction of biased reasoning patterns. Experiments on the MIMIC-IV dataset show that CAP substantially improves both predictive accuracy and fairness. CAP increases AUROC from 0.806 to 0.873 and AUPRC from 0.497 to 0.694, while reducing sex- and race-related disparities by over 90%. Feature reliance analysis further indicates highly consistent attention patterns across demographic groups, with similarity scores exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit measurable bias in ICU mortality prediction, and that a carefully designed prompting framework can effectively co-optimize fairness and performance without retraining, offering a transferable paradigm for equitable clinical decision support.

### [83] [OASI: Objective-Aware Surrogate Initialization for Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization in TinyML Keyword Spotting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19739)
*Soumen Garai,Suman Samui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为OASI的新初始化策略，用于在超低功耗TinyML设备上实现关键词检测（KWS）模型的多目标优化。该方法利用多目标模拟退火（MOSA）生成高性能且多样化的初始配置集，以平衡模型精度与大小，在资源受限条件下显著优于传统的随机、拉丁超立方或Sobol序列初始化方法。实验表明，OASI在多个运行中实现了最高的超体积（0.0627）和最低的世代距离（0.0），计算开销仅略有增加。统计分析显示其性能一致性更优，尽管整体差异未达显著水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在超低功耗TinyML设备上部署高精度关键词检测（KWS）模型面临精度与资源（如闪存）严格权衡的挑战。现有初始化方法（如LHS、Sobol、随机搜索）缺乏对帕累托前沿的适应性，且未经过严谨的统计比较，导致多目标贝叶斯优化（MOBO）性能受限。因此需要一种更智能、更高效的初始化策略来提升MOBO在预算黑箱设置下的表现。

Method: 提出Objective-Aware Surrogate Initialization (OASI)，基于多目标模拟退火（MOSA）生成种子帕累托集，通过引导采样过程聚焦于高绩效且多样化的配置，从而为后续的多目标优化提供高质量初始点。该方法显式考虑了精度与模型尺寸之间的权衡，适用于资源受限的嵌入式环境。

Result: 在TinyML KWS任务中，OASI在多个运行中均表现出最佳性能：达到最高超体积（0.0627）和最低生成距离（0.0）。虽然计算时间略增（1934秒对比约1500秒），但收益显著。非参数统计检验（Kruskal-Wallis H=5.40, p=0.144, η²=0.0007）与Dunn事后检验确认其在一致性方面优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: OASI是一种高效、鲁棒的初始化策略，能够有效提升多目标优化在资源受限场景下的性能与稳定性。其在无需大幅增加计算成本的前提下，显著改善了初始解的质量，为边缘设备上的轻量级模型设计提供了新范式。

Abstract: Voice assistants utilize Keyword Spotting (KWS) to enable efficient, privacy-friendly activation. However, realizing accurate KWS models on ultra-low-power TinyML devices (often with less than $<2$ MB of flash memory) necessitates a delicate balance between accuracy with strict resource constraints. Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) is an ideal candidate for managing such a trade-off but is highly initialization-dependent, especially under the budgeted black-box setting. Existing methods typically fall back to naive, ad-hoc sampling routines (e.g., Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), Sobol sequences, or Random search) that are adapted to neither the Pareto front nor undergo rigorous statistical comparison. To address this, we propose Objective-Aware Surrogate Initialization (OASI), a novel initialization strategy that leverages Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA) to generate a seed Pareto set of high-performing and diverse configurations that explicitly balance accuracy and model size. Evaluated in a TinyML KWS setting, OASI outperforms LHS, Sobol, and Random initialization, achieving the highest hypervolume (0.0627) and the lowest generational distance (0.0) across multiple runs, with only a modest increase in computation time (1934 s vs. $\sim$1500 s). A non-parametric statistical analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test ($H = 5.40$, $p = 0.144$, $η^2 = 0.0007$) and Dunn's post-hoc test confirms OASI's superior consistency despite the non-significant overall difference with respect to the $α=0.05$ threshold.

Abstract: Deploying large-scale transformer models on edge devices presents significant challenges due to strict constraints on memory, compute, and latency. In this work, we propose a lightweight yet effective multi-stage optimization pipeline designed to compress and accelerate Vision Transformers (ViTs) for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Our methodology combines activation profiling, memory-aware pruning, selective mixed-precision execution, and activation-aware quantization (AWQ) to reduce the model's memory footprint without requiring costly retraining or task-specific fine-tuning. Starting from a ViT-Huge backbone with 632 million parameters, we first identify low-importance channels using activation statistics collected via forward hooks, followed by structured pruning to shrink the MLP layers under a target memory budget. We further apply FP16 conversion to selected components and leverage AWQ to quantize the remaining model weights and activations to INT8 with minimal accuracy degradation. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the fully optimized model achieves a 76% reduction in peak memory usage and over 6x lower latency, while retaining or even improving accuracy compared to the original FP32 baseline. This framework offers a practical path toward efficient transformer inference on edge platforms, and opens future avenues for integrating dynamic sparsity and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures to further scale performance across diverse tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CUDA-APML 是一种稀疏的 GPU 实现，通过阈值化微小分配并直接在 COO 格式中执行自适应 softmax、双向对称化和 Sinkhorn 归一化，实现了近线性的内存增长。它在保持梯度的同时，将峰值 GPU 内存使用量减少了 99.9%，同时在 ShapeNet 和 MM-Fi 上与密集版 APML 的性能差异极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有损失函数如 Chamfer Distance 计算高效但存在多对一对应问题，Earth Mover Distance 虽准确但计算成本高。APML 虽通过可微 Sinkhorn 迭代逼近运输过程，但其密集形式内存开销为二次方，限制了大规模点云应用。因此需要一种高效且低内存消耗的实现方式。

Method: 提出 CUDA-APML，采用稀疏表示（COO 格式），通过阈值剔除不重要的配对，结合自适应 softmax、双向对称化和 Sinkhorn 归一化，在 GPU 上直接处理稀疏数据，从而降低内存占用并保持梯度信息。

Result: 在 ShapeNet 和 MM-Fi 数据集上，CUDA-APML 与密集版 APML 性能接近，误差极小；峰值 GPU 内存降低达 99.9%，实现近线性内存增长，同时保留梯度传播能力。

Conclusion: CUDA-APML 有效解决了 APML 的内存瓶颈问题，为大规模 3D 点云学习提供了高效、低内存的可微损失函数解决方案。

Abstract: Loss functions are fundamental to learning accurate 3D point cloud models, yet common choices trade geometric fidelity for computational cost. Chamfer Distance is efficient but permits many-to-one correspondences, while Earth Mover Distance better reflects one-to-one transport at high computational cost. APML approximates transport with differentiable Sinkhorn iterations and an analytically derived temperature, but its dense formulation scales quadratically in memory. We present CUDA-APML, a sparse GPU implementation that thresholds negligible assignments and runs adaptive softmax, bidirectional symmetrization, and Sinkhorn normalization directly in COO form. This yields near-linear memory scaling and preserves gradients on the stored support, while pairwise distance evaluation remains quadratic in the current implementation. On ShapeNet and MM-Fi, CUDA-APML matches dense APML within a small tolerance while reducing peak GPU memory by 99.9%. Code available at: https://github.com/Multimodal-Sensing-Lab/apml

Conclusion: 本文通过理论分析揭示了推理学习中采样分布的重要性，并实证表明仅保留推理阶段的提示后验采样（PPS）是一种高效且优越的推理学习策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) solve reasoning problems by first generating a rationale and then answering. We formalize reasoning as a latent variable model and derive an expectation-maximization (EM) objective for learning to reason. This view connects EM and modern reward-based optimization, and shows that the main challenge lies in designing a sampling distribution that generates rationales that justify correct answers. We instantiate and compare several sampling schemes: rejection sampling with a budget, self-taught reasoner (STaR), and prompt posterior sampling (PPS), which only keeps the rationalization stage of STaR. Our experiments on the ARC, MMLU, and OpenBookQA datasets with the Llama and Qwen models show that the sampling scheme can significantly affect the accuracy of learned reasoning models. Despite its simplicity, we observe that PPS outperforms the other sampling schemes.

### [89] [Learning to Design City-scale Transit Routes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19767)
*Bibek Poudel,Weizi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an RL-based framework using graph attention networks to automatically design efficient transit networks. It introduces a two-level reward system to handle long-term planning challenges and demonstrates superior performance over real-world and heuristic-based designs on a real city dataset, achieving major improvements in service rates, wait times, and route efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing efficient transit route networks is a complex, NP-hard problem traditionally solved through manual planning, which is time-consuming and suboptimal. The need for automated, scalable, and high-performing solutions motivates the development of data-driven approaches.

Method: An end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on graph attention networks is proposed for sequential transit network construction. It uses a two-level reward structure: incremental topological feedback for intermediate progress and simulation-based terminal rewards for final performance evaluation, addressing long-horizon credit assignment challenges.

Result: Evaluated on a real-world dataset from Bloomington, Indiana, the proposed method outperforms both real-world designs and traditional heuristics. Under high transit adoption with transit center initialization, it achieves 25.6% higher service rates, 30.9% shorter wait times, and 21.0% better bus utilization. Under mixed-mode conditions with random initialization, it delivers 68.8% higher route efficiency than demand coverage heuristics and 5.9% lower travel times than shortest path construction.

Conclusion: End-to-end reinforcement learning with graph attention networks can effectively design transit networks that significantly surpass human-designed systems and hand-crafted heuristics on realistic city-scale benchmarks.

Abstract: Designing efficient transit route networks is an NP-hard problem with exponentially large solution spaces that traditionally relies on manual planning processes. We present an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on graph attention networks for sequential transit network construction. To address the long-horizon credit assignment challenge, we introduce a two-level reward structure combining incremental topological feedback with simulation-based terminal rewards. We evaluate our approach on a new real-world dataset from Bloomington, Indiana with topologically accurate road networks, census-derived demand, and existing transit routes. Our learned policies substantially outperform existing designs and traditional heuristics across two initialization schemes and two modal-split scenarios. Under high transit adoption with transit center initialization, our approach achieves 25.6% higher service rates, 30.9\% shorter wait times, and 21.0% better bus utilization compared to the real-world network. Under mixed-mode conditions with random initialization, it delivers 68.8% higher route efficiency than demand coverage heuristics and 5.9% lower travel times than shortest path construction. These results demonstrate that end-to-end RL can design transit networks that substantially outperform both human-designed systems and hand-crafted heuristics on realistic city-scale benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了机器学习中聚类算法的可重复性问题，分解了K-Means、DBSCAN和Ward等常见算法的基本步骤，识别了实现每一步可重复性的条件。通过scikit-learn库的实现示例发现，当OpenMP线程数超过两个时，K-Means会出现不一致结果。研究旨在提醒用户和开发者关注此问题，并推动进一步调查与修复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保机器学习模型和实验的可重复性对于科学严谨性至关重要，尤其是对于需要位级完全相同结果的算法，以支持调试和验证。然而，现有实现中存在潜在的不可重复性问题，尤其在并行计算环境下。

Method: 将K-Means、DBSCAN和Ward等聚类算法分解为基本步骤，分析每个阶段实现可重复性的必要条件；使用Python scikit-learn库进行具体实现与测试，重点考察不同OpenMP线程数量对结果一致性的影响。

Result: 实验结果显示，在OpenMP线程数超过两个的情况下，K-Means算法产生不一致的结果，表明其在并行执行下缺乏可重复性。其他算法如DBSCAN和Ward在相同条件下表现相对稳定。

Conclusion: 当前部分聚类算法（特别是K-Means）在多线程环境下存在可重复性问题，影响科学可信度。应提高用户和开发者的警觉性，推动算法实现的改进与标准化。

Abstract: Reproducibility is essential in machine learning because it ensures that a model or experiment yields the same scientific conclusion. For specific algorithms repeatability with bitwise identical results is also a key for scientific integrity because it allows debugging. We decomposed several very popular clustering algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN and Ward into their fundamental steps, and we identify the conditions required to achieve repeatability at each stage. We use an implementation example with the Python library scikit-learn to examine the repeatable aspects of each method. Our results reveal inconsistent results with K-Means when the number of OpenMP threads exceeds two. This work aims to raise awareness of this issue among both users and developers, encouraging further investigation and potential fixes.

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一套可复用的因果目标投放解决方案，支持营销人员在保障业务安全的前提下实现规模化、数据驱动的精准营销，推动营销策略向更科学、可衡量的方向演进。

Abstract: This paper introduces a marketing decision framework that converts heterogeneous-treatment uplift into constrained targeting strategies to maximize revenue and retention while honoring business guardrails. The approach estimates Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE) with uplift learners and then solves a constrained allocation to decide who to target and which offer to deploy under limits such as budget or acceptable sales deterioration. Applied to retention messaging, event rewards, and spend-threshold assignment, the framework consistently outperforms propensity and static baselines in offline evaluations using uplift AUC, Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS), and Self-Normalized IPS (SNIPS). A production-scale online A/B test further validates strategic lift on revenue and completion while preserving customer-experience constraints. The result is a reusable playbook for marketers to operationalize causal targeting at scale, set guardrails, and align campaigns with strategic KPIs.

Result: 所提方法在多种下游任务上持续超越微调和上下文学习基线，尤其在小样本场景下优势显著，兼具样本效率与高性能。

Conclusion: 将上下文学习机制嵌入微调流程是一种高效且稳健的模型适应策略，能够兼顾数据稀缺与充足两种情形，是未来模型适配的重要方向。

Abstract: When adapting large language models (LLMs) to a specific downstream task, two primary approaches are commonly employed: (1) prompt engineering, often with in-context few-shot learning, leveraging the model's inherent generalization abilities, and (2) fine-tuning on task-specific data, directly optimizing the model's parameters. While prompt-based methods excel in few-shot scenarios, their effectiveness often plateaus as more data becomes available. Conversely, fine-tuning scales well with data but may underperform when training examples are scarce. We investigate a unified approach that bridges these two paradigms by incorporating in-context learning directly into the fine-tuning process. Specifically, we fine-tune the model on task-specific data augmented with in-context examples, mimicking the structure of k-shot prompts. This approach, while requiring per-task fine-tuning, combines the sample efficiency of in-context learning with the performance gains of fine-tuning, leading to a method that consistently matches and often significantly exceeds both these baselines. To perform hyperparameter selection in the low-data regime, we propose to use prequential evaluation, which eliminates the need for expensive cross-validation and leverages all available data for training while simultaneously providing a robust validation signal. We conduct an extensive empirical study to determine which adaptation paradigm - fine-tuning, in-context learning, or our proposed unified approach offers the best predictive performance on a concrete data downstream-tasks.

*Indranil Halder,Cengiz Pehlevan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究大语言模型在推理时间扩展中的泛化性能，提出一个可解析的贝叶斯线性回归模型，结合奖励加权采样机制，模拟LLM作为评判者的情境。在高维极限下，推导出后验预测均值和方差的闭式表达，并分析了在教师模型生成训练数据下的泛化误差。研究表明，当奖励与教师模型接近时，增加推理采样数 $k$ 可单调降低误差；但奖励严重偏离时存在最优 $k$，超过后误差反而上升。固定 $k$ 时存在最优温度。实验验证了这些结论，并理论证明在“最佳-$k$”情形下，泛化误差以 $Θ(1/k^2)$ 衰减，且通过极值理论确定系数。结果揭示了推理计算扩展优于更多数据收集的适用范围，同时指出任务难度提升会削弱该优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大语言模型中推理时间扩展的原理，尤其是如何通过增加推理阶段的计算（如采样）来改善性能，而无需额外数据或训练成本。当前对推理阶段资源分配的理论基础尚不清晰，尤其在高维、复杂任务下的行为机制缺乏解析分析。

Method: 构建一个贝叶斯线性回归模型，结合基于软最大函数的奖励加权采样机制，其中奖励由线性模型决定，模拟大语言模型作为评判者（LLM-as-a-judge）的场景。在高维极限下使用确定性等价方法推导后验预测的闭式解。通过分析训练数据来自教师模型时的泛化误差，研究不同采样数 $k$ 与温度参数对性能的影响。采用极值理论分析‘最佳-$k$’情形下的误差衰减率。

Result: 当奖励与教师模型相近时，泛化误差随采样数 $k$ 单调下降；当奖励严重失配时，存在有限最优 $k$，过量采样反而恶化性能。对于固定 $k$，存在最优采样温度。在‘最佳-$k$’设定下，泛化误差以 $Θ(1/k^2)$ 速率衰减，且可确定主导系数。实验验证了理论预测，显示推理计算扩展在特定条件下优于数据扩充。然而，随着任务难度上升，推理扩展的优势逐渐减弱。

Conclusion: 本研究为大语言模型推理时间扩展提供了理论基础，揭示了采样数量、奖励设计与温度调控之间的平衡关系。理论表明，在合适条件下，增加推理计算可显著优于收集更多训练数据。但该优势受限于任务难度和奖励准确性，提示实际应用中需谨慎设计奖励机制与采样策略。

Abstract: Recent developments in large language models have shown advantages in reallocating a notable share of computational resource from training time to inference time. However, the principles behind inference time scaling are not well understood. In this paper, we introduce an analytically tractable model of inference-time scaling: Bayesian linear regression with a reward-weighted sampler, where the reward is determined from a linear model, modeling LLM-as-a-judge scenario. We study this problem in the high-dimensional regime, where the deterministic equivalents dictate a closed-form expression for the posterior predictive mean and variance. We analyze the generalization error when training data are sampled from a teacher model. We draw $k$ inference-time samples and select via softmax at a temperature applied to a quadratic reward. When the reward is not too different from the teacher, the generalization error decreases monotonically with increasing inference time samples $k$. However, the specific reward that optimizes inference-time selection generally differs from the teacher. In contrast, substantial reward misspecification induces a finite optimal $k$ beyond which more sampling can increase the generalization error. For fixed $k$, there exists an optimal sampling temperature. We experimentally verify these facts in large language model inference with an additional large language model as a judge. In the "best-of-$k$" limit with the teacher as reward, we theoretically show that the generalization error decays as $Θ(1/k^2)$ and determine the leading coefficient via extreme value theory. These formulas delineate domains where scaling inference-time computation is provably preferable to collecting more data. Finally, we demonstrate that when task difficulty increases, the previously mentioned advantage of inference-time compute degrades.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CGM-FAS的深度学习方法，用于建模傅里叶振幅谱（FAS）中的非遍历路径效应。该方法基于条件变分自编码器架构，利用地震和台站的地理坐标作为条件变量，直接从数据中学习空间模式和频间相关性，无需预设相关函数。与基于高斯过程（GP）的方法相比，CGM-FAS在大规模预测中具有更高的计算效率，可在10秒内完成对10,000个站点、1,000个频率的预测，仅需几GB内存，并能生成与经验GP模型一致的变异特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有非遍历地面运动模型依赖高斯过程方法，受限于预设相关函数且计算成本高，难以实现大范围快速预测。为克服这些局限，亟需一种更高效、灵活的数据驱动方法来建模非遍历路径效应。

Method: 采用条件变分自编码器（Conditional VAE）架构，以地理坐标为条件输入，通过端到端训练学习地震与台站之间的空间依赖关系及频间相关性，从而生成非遍历路径效应。

Result: 在旧金山湾区地震数据上，CGM-FAS的表现与最新GP基GMM一致，能准确捕捉非遍历路径效应；同时在速度、内存使用和灵活性方面显著优于传统方法，支持大规模高频谱预测。

Conclusion: CGM-FAS是一种高效且可扩展的非遍历地面运动预测新方法，能够有效学习复杂空间结构并实现快速预测，为多频率、大区域的地震危险性分析提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Recent developments in non-ergodic ground-motion models (GMMs) explicitly model systematic spatial variations in source, site, and path effects, reducing standard deviation to 30-40% of ergodic models and enabling more accurate site-specific seismic hazard analysis. Current non-ergodic GMMs rely on Gaussian Process (GP) methods with prescribed correlation functions and thus have computational limitations for large-scale predictions. This study proposes a deep-learning approach called Conditional Generative Modeling for Fourier Amplitude Spectra (CGM-FAS) as an alternative to GP-based methods for modeling non-ergodic path effects in Fourier Amplitude Spectra (FAS). CGM-FAS uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder architecture to learn spatial patterns and interfrequency correlation directly from data by using geographical coordinates of earthquakes and stations as conditional variables. Using San Francisco Bay Area earthquake data, we compare CGM-FAS against a recent GP-based GMM for the region and demonstrate consistent predictions of non-ergodic path effects. Additionally, CGM-FAS offers advantages compared to GP-based approaches in learning spatial patterns without prescribed correlation functions, capturing interfrequency correlations, and enabling rapid predictions, generating maps for 10,000 sites across 1,000 frequencies within 10 seconds using a few GB of memory. CGM-FAS hyperparameters can be tuned to ensure generated path effects exhibit variability consistent with the GP-based empirical GMM. This work demonstrates a promising direction for efficient non-ergodic ground-motion prediction across multiple frequencies and large spatial domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究大模型在关键领域部署中因幻觉问题导致的瓶颈，提出通过行为校准（behavioral calibration）方法，使模型在不确定时主动承认不确定性，从而提升其可信度。通过优化严格合适的评分规则，训练模型输出准确的置信度概率，实现拒绝回答或标记不确定陈述的能力。实验表明，即使小型模型（如Qwen3-4B-Instruct）经此训练后，在不确定性量化方面超越前沿大模型，尤其在数学推理和跨领域事实问答任务中表现优异，具备可迁移的元技能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大模型在关键应用中受限于幻觉问题，即生成看似合理但错误的信息。现有训练范式（如基于二值奖励的强化学习）鼓励模型‘猜答案’而非诚实表达，导致模型在低置信度时仍强行输出。因此亟需一种机制让模型学会识别并承认自身不确定性，以提升可靠性与可信度。

Method: 提出基于严格合适评分规则的行为校准训练框架，通过强化学习优化模型输出的置信度分布，使其在不确定时选择不回答或标注可疑部分。结合合成数据与特定任务微调，实现对模型不确定性判断能力的系统性提升。

Result: 在数学推理任务（BeyondAIME）中，4B模型的准确率-幻觉比增益达0.806，超过GPT-5的0.207；在跨域事实问答（SimpleQA）中，该模型零样本校准误差与Grok-4、Gemini-2.5-Pro等前沿模型相当，尽管其原始事实准确率较低。说明不确定性校准能力可独立于预测性能提升。

Conclusion: 行为校准是一种可有效抑制幻觉、提升模型可信度的关键策略，且其带来的不确定性量化能力具有高度可迁移性，小模型经训练后可媲美甚至超越大模型，为安全可靠的模型部署提供了新路径。

Abstract: LLM deployment in critical domains is currently impeded by persistent hallucinations--generating plausible but factually incorrect assertions. While scaling laws drove significant improvements in general capabilities, theoretical frameworks suggest hallucination is not merely stochastic error but a predictable statistical consequence of training objectives prioritizing mimicking data distribution over epistemic honesty. Standard RLVR paradigms, utilizing binary reward signals, inadvertently incentivize models as good test-takers rather than honest communicators, encouraging guessing whenever correctness probability exceeds zero. This paper presents an exhaustive investigation into behavioral calibration, which incentivizes models to stochastically admit uncertainty by abstaining when not confident, aligning model behavior with accuracy. Synthesizing recent advances, we propose and evaluate training interventions optimizing strictly proper scoring rules for models to output a calibrated probability of correctness. Our methods enable models to either abstain from producing a complete response or flag individual claims where uncertainty remains. Utilizing Qwen3-4B-Instruct, empirical analysis reveals behavior-calibrated reinforcement learning allows smaller models to surpass frontier models in uncertainty quantification--a transferable meta-skill decouplable from raw predictive accuracy. Trained on math reasoning tasks, our model's log-scale Accuracy-to-Hallucination Ratio gain (0.806) exceeds GPT-5's (0.207) in a challenging in-domain evaluation (BeyondAIME). Moreover, in cross-domain factual QA (SimpleQA), our 4B LLM achieves zero-shot calibration error on par with frontier models including Grok-4 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, even though its factual accuracy is much lower.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地震学中的状态预测与重建面临巨大挑战，包括源位置、机制及地球模型的参数不确定性；传统模拟因数据量大、计算复杂而受限，真实数据则受制于模型不准确和传感器稀疏。现有机器学习方法虽有潜力，但缺乏统一评估标准，导致进展模糊不清。因此亟需一个标准化框架来促进公平比较与可靠评价。

Method: 提出并实施通用任务框架（CTF）用于地震波场机器学习，包含多个尺度的数据集（全球、地壳、局部）以及针对特定任务的度量指标。该框架借鉴自然语言处理领域的成功经验，支持在真实约束条件下的算法性能对比，如噪声干扰与数据稀缺性。

Abstract: Seismology faces fundamental challenges in state forecasting and reconstruction (e.g., earthquake early warning and ground motion prediction) and managing the parametric variability of source locations, mechanisms, and Earth models (e.g., subsurface structure and topography effects). Addressing these with simulations is hindered by their massive scale, both in synthetic data volumes and numerical complexity, while real-data efforts are constrained by models that inadequately reflect the Earth's complexity and by sparse sensor measurements from the field. Recent machine learning (ML) efforts offer promise, but progress is obscured by a lack of proper characterization, fair reporting, and rigorous comparisons. To address this, we introduce a Common Task Framework (CTF) for ML for seismic wavefields, starting with three distinct wavefield datasets. Our CTF features a curated set of datasets at various scales (global, crustal, and local) and task-specific metrics spanning forecasting, reconstruction, and generalization under realistic constraints such as noise and limited data. Inspired by CTFs in fields like natural language processing, this framework provides a structured and rigorous foundation for head-to-head algorithm evaluation. We illustrate the evaluation procedure with scores reported for two of the datasets, showcasing the performance of various methods and foundation models for reconstructing seismic wavefields from both simulated and real-world sensor measurements. The CTF scores reveal the strengths, limitations, and suitability for specific problem classes. Our vision is to replace ad hoc comparisons with standardized evaluations on hidden test sets, raising the bar for rigor and reproducibility in scientific ML.

### [97] [Conditional Adversarial Fragility in Financial Machine Learning under Macroeconomic Stress](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19935)
*Samruddhi Baviskar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出条件对抗脆弱性（Conditional Adversarial Fragility），揭示金融机器学习模型在宏观经济压力时期对抗鲁棒性显著下降的现象。通过基于波动率的经济状态分段，研究发现模型在稳定期与压力期的表现差异主要体现在对抗攻击下的性能退化，而非基础预测能力。尤其在压力时期，错误漏报率上升，风险敏感指标恶化。研究还引入基于大语言模型的语义审计解释层，以增强模型治理。结论表明，金融领域的对抗鲁棒性具有状态依赖性，需采用压力感知的风险评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗鲁棒性评估多基于静态假设，但金融系统运行于非平稳经济环境，导致评估结果无法反映真实风险。特别是在经济压力时期，模型对抗脆弱性可能被放大，带来严重决策风险，因此亟需建立考虑宏观状态的评估框架。

Method: 采用基于波动率的经济状态分段方法划分宏观经济周期，保持模型架构、攻击方式和评估协议不变，对比模型在平静期与压力期下的对抗鲁棒性表现；同时引入大语言模型对模型解释进行语义审计，构建可解释的治理层。

Result: 基准预测性能在不同经济状态下相似，说明经济压力本身不导致性能退化；但在对抗扰动下，压力期模型的准确率、决策阈值稳定性及风险敏感度显著下降；错误漏报率上升，增加高风险案例被忽略的风险；语义审计揭示了模型解释在压力期的不可靠性。

Conclusion: 对抗鲁棒性在金融机器学习中是受经济状态调节的属性，必须发展压力感知的模型风险评估机制，以保障高风险金融部署中的可靠性与安全性。

Abstract: Machine learning models used in financial decision systems operate in nonstationary economic environments, yet adversarial robustness is typically evaluated under static assumptions. This work introduces Conditional Adversarial Fragility, a regime dependent phenomenon in which adversarial vulnerability is systematically amplified during periods of macroeconomic stress. We propose a regime aware evaluation framework for time indexed tabular financial classification tasks that conditions robustness assessment on external indicators of economic stress. Using volatility based regime segmentation as a proxy for macroeconomic conditions, we evaluate model behavior across calm and stress periods while holding model architecture, attack methodology, and evaluation protocols constant. Baseline predictive performance remains comparable across regimes, indicating that economic stress alone does not induce inherent performance degradation. Under adversarial perturbations, however, models operating during stress regimes exhibit substantially greater degradation across predictive accuracy, operational decision thresholds, and risk sensitive outcomes. We further demonstrate that this amplification propagates to increased false negative rates, elevating the risk of missed high risk cases during adverse conditions. To complement numerical robustness metrics, we introduce an interpretive governance layer based on semantic auditing of model explanations using large language models. Together, these results demonstrate that adversarial robustness in financial machine learning is a regime dependent property and motivate stress aware approaches to model risk assessment in high stakes financial deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实世界中的时序预测（如金融、能源）常面临训练数据有限及复杂噪声动态的挑战。现有深度模型通常使用完整时间窗口监督，包含大量高频噪声，掩盖了长期趋势；同时，富含领域信息的辅助变量在少样本情况下未被充分利用。

Method: 提出LoFT-LLM框架，包含三个阶段：1）通过Patch Low-Frequency Module（PLFM）从局部谱块中提取低频稳定趋势；2）采用残差学习器建模高频率变化；3）利用微调的大语言模型（LLM），结合结构化自然语言提示，整合辅助变量与领域知识对预测结果进行语义校准。

Result: 在多个金融与能源数据集上进行的广泛实验表明，LoFT-LLM在全数据和少样本条件下均显著优于现有强基线模型，在预测精度、鲁棒性和可解释性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: LoFT-LLM通过频率感知设计与大语言模型的语义增强，有效缓解了数据稀疏与噪声干扰问题，为复杂时序预测提供了一种高效、可解释的新范式。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting in real-world applications such as finance and energy often faces challenges due to limited training data and complex, noisy temporal dynamics. Existing deep forecasting models typically supervise predictions using full-length temporal windows, which include substantial high-frequency noise and obscure long-term trends. Moreover, auxiliary variables containing rich domain-specific information are often underutilized, especially in few-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose LoFT-LLM, a frequency-aware forecasting pipeline that integrates low-frequency learning with semantic calibration via a large language model (LLM). Firstly, a Patch Low-Frequency forecasting Module (PLFM) extracts stable low-frequency trends from localized spectral patches. Secondly, a residual learner then models high-frequency variations. Finally, a fine-tuned LLM refines the predictions by incorporating auxiliary context and domain knowledge through structured natural language prompts. Extensive experiments on financial and energy datasets demonstrate that LoFT-LLM significantly outperforms strong baselines under both full-data and few-shot regimes, delivering superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的分数估计方法——控制变量分数恒等式（CVSI），通过统一标准去噪分数恒等式（DSI）和目标分数恒等式（TSI），在全噪声范围内实现方差最小化。该方法利用时变控制系数，显著降低采样过程中的方差，提升数据无关采样器学习和推理阶段扩散采样的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如DSI在低噪声区域方差高，而TSI在高噪声区域方差大，二者存在根本性的方差权衡问题，亟需一种能兼顾全噪声范围的高效分数估计方法。

Method: 基于控制变量框架，将DSI与TSI统一为一个整体，推导出理论上最优的时变控制系数，以实现全噪声谱下的方差最小化。

Result: CVSI在多种任务中均表现出更低的方差和更高的样本效率，尤其在数据缺失场景和推理阶段扩散采样中表现优异。

Conclusion: CVSI提供了一个理论完备且实用性强的分数估计方案，是当前扩散模型采样中高效、稳定估计的重要进展。

Abstract: Diffusion models offer a robust framework for sampling from unnormalized probability densities, which requires accurately estimating the score of the noise-perturbed target distribution. While the standard Denoising Score Identity (DSI) relies on data samples, access to the target energy function enables an alternative formulation via the Target Score Identity (TSI). However, these estimators face a fundamental variance trade-off: DSI exhibits high variance in low-noise regimes, whereas TSI suffers from high variance at high noise levels. In this work, we reconcile these approaches by unifying both estimators within the principled framework of control variates. We introduce the Control Variate Score Identity (CVSI), deriving an optimal, time-dependent control coefficient that theoretically guarantees variance minimization across the entire noise spectrum. We demonstrate that CVSI serves as a robust, low-variance plug-in estimator that significantly enhances sample efficiency in both data-free sampler learning and inference-time diffusion sampling.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为OGAB的新激活函数，旨在缓解深度学习分类器中的类别不平衡问题。OGAB通过引入正交性和群体感知偏差学习，增强在不平衡数据下的特征可区分性，无需显式标签信息。其核心思想是利用激活函数引入强归纳偏置，以应对复杂的数据挑战。正交变换有助于保持少数类的信息，防止多数类在嵌入空间中占据主导地位；群体感知偏差机制则能自动识别数据聚类并调整嵌入，提升类别可分性。与依赖数据预处理或后处理的方法不同，该方法在训练阶段的嵌入学习层面直接解决类别不平衡问题，可无缝集成到学习流程中。实验表明，该方法在真实和合成不平衡数据集上均显著优于传统及可学习激活函数。

Motivation: 类别不平衡是机器学习和数据挖掘中的常见挑战，会导致分类器性能下降。尽管深度学习在特征提取方面表现优异，但在不平衡数据下性能仍会退化。现有方法多通过数据预处理或后处理来缓解此问题，但未能从根本上解决嵌入空间中的不平衡问题。因此，亟需一种在训练过程中直接干预、提升特征可区分性的新方法。

Method: 提出OGAB激活函数，结合正交性约束和群体感知偏差学习机制。正交性确保特征独立性，避免多数类主导嵌入空间；群体感知偏差自动识别数据簇并调整嵌入分布，增强类别分离。该方法在嵌入学习阶段直接作用于模型训练过程，无需额外标注或修改数据。

Result: 在多个真实世界和合成的不平衡数据集上，OGAB显著提升了分类性能，优于传统激活函数（如ReLU）和可学习激活函数（如Swish）。其在少数类上的召回率和整体准确率均有明显改善，且对不同不平衡比例具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: OGAB通过在激活函数层面引入正交性和群体感知偏差，有效缓解了深度学习中的类别不平衡问题。该方法无需依赖标签信息或外部处理步骤，能够直接融入训练过程，为不平衡数据学习提供了一种高效、通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Class imbalance is a common challenge in machine learning and data mining, often leading to suboptimal performance in classifiers. While deep learning excels in feature extraction, its performance still deteriorates under imbalanced data. In this work, we propose a novel activation function, named OGAB, designed to alleviate class imbalance in deep learning classifiers. OGAB incorporates orthogonality and group-aware bias learning to enhance feature distinguishability in imbalanced scenarios without explicitly requiring label information. Our key insight is that activation functions can be used to introduce strong inductive biases that can address complex data challenges beyond traditional non-linearity. Our work demonstrates that orthogonal transformations can preserve information about minority classes by maintaining feature independence, thereby preventing the dominance of majority classes in the embedding space. Further, the proposed group-aware bias mechanism automatically identifies data clusters and adjusts embeddings to enhance class separability without the need for explicit supervision. Unlike existing approaches that address class imbalance through preprocessing data modifications or post-processing corrections, our proposed approach tackles class imbalance during the training phase at the embedding learning level, enabling direct integration with the learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution on both real-world and synthetic imbalanced datasets, showing consistent performance improvements over both traditional and learnable activation functions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在未知环境中学习可控马尔可夫链的动态行为是强化学习与最优控制的核心问题。传统的平稳策略在存在特定状态（如瞬态、吸收态）时难以实现最优探索，因此需要设计一种能够随时间动态调整的非平稳策略以最大化信息获取。

Abstract: Controllable Markov chains describe the dynamics of sequential decision making tasks and are the central component in optimal control and reinforcement learning. In this work, we give the general form of an optimal policy for learning controllable dynamics in an unknown environment by exploring over a limited time horizon. This policy is simple to implement and efficient to compute, and allows an agent to ``learn by exploring" as it maximizes its information gain in a greedy fashion by selecting controls from a constraint set that changes over time during exploration. We give a simple parameterization for the set of controls, and present an algorithm for finding an optimal policy. The reason for this policy is due to the existence of certain types of states that restrict control of the dynamics; such as transient states, absorbing states, and non-backtracking states. We show why the occurrence of these states makes a non-stationary policy essential for achieving optimal exploration. Six interesting examples of controllable dynamics are treated in detail. Policy optimality is demonstrated using counting arguments, comparing with suboptimal policies, and by making use of a sequential improvement property from dynamic programming.

TL;DR: 提出PairFlow，一种轻量级预处理步骤，用于加速离散流模型（DFM）的采样，无需预训练教师模型。通过闭式反演构建源-目标分布配对样本，仅需1.7%的训练计算开销，即可实现少步采样，性能优于或媲美两阶段微调方法，并提升后续蒸馏效果。

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{PairFlow}$, a lightweight preprocessing step for training Discrete Flow Models (DFMs) to achieve few-step sampling without requiring a pretrained teacher. DFMs have recently emerged as a new class of generative models for discrete data, offering strong performance. However, they suffer from slow sampling due to their iterative nature. Existing acceleration methods largely depend on finetuning, which introduces substantial additional training overhead. $\texttt{PairFlow}$ addresses this issue with a lightweight preprocessing step. Inspired by ReFlow and its extension to DFMs, we train DFMs from coupled samples of source and target distributions, without requiring any pretrained teacher. At the core of our approach is a closed-form inversion for DFMs, which allows efficient construction of paired source-target samples. Despite its extremely low cost, taking only up to 1.7% of the compute needed for full model training, $\texttt{PairFlow}$ matches or even surpasses the performance of two-stage training involving finetuning. Furthermore, models trained with our framework provide stronger base models for subsequent distillation, yielding further acceleration after finetuning. Experiments on molecular data as well as binary and RGB images demonstrate the broad applicability and effectiveness of our approach.

### [103] [QE-Catalytic: A Graph-Language Multimodal Base Model for Relaxed-Energy Prediction in Catalytic Adsorption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20084)
*Yanjie Li,Jian Xu,Xueqing Chen,Lina Yu,Shiming Xiang,Weijun Li,Cheng-lin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QE-Catalytic is a multimodal framework that combines a large language model (Qwen) with an E(3)-equivariant graph Transformer (Equiformer-V2) to improve adsorption energy prediction and enable inverse design for catalytic surfaces. It leverages 3D atomic structures and structured text, injecting geometric information into the language model via graph-text alignment, enabling high-accuracy predictions even without precise coordinates and supporting CIF file generation for structure design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language-model-based approaches lack accuracy in predicting adsorption-configuration energies and struggle to distinguish between different configurations of the same system, despite graph-assisted pretraining. There is a need for a more accurate and versatile model that can handle both forward prediction and inverse design in complex catalytic systems.

Method: QE-Catalytic integrates Qwen (a large language model) with Equiformer-V2 (an E(3)-equivariant graph Transformer). It uses 3D atomic coordinates and structured configuration text as inputs, aligning graph and text representations to inject 3D geometric information into the language channel. This enables unified prediction and autoregressive CIF generation for target-energy-driven design.

Result: On the OC20 dataset, QE-Catalytic reduces the MAE of relaxed adsorption energy from 0.713 eV to 0.486 eV, outperforming baseline models like CatBERTa and GAP-CATBERTa across multiple evaluation protocols.

Conclusion: The proposed QE-Catalytic framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in adsorption energy prediction and enables effective inverse design by seamlessly combining 3D structural data with textual descriptions through multimodal learning.

Abstract: Adsorption energy is a key descriptor of catalytic reactivity. It is fundamentally defined as the difference between the relaxed total energy of the adsorbate-surface system and that of an appropriate reference state; therefore, the accuracy of relaxed-energy prediction directly determines the reliability of machine-learning-driven catalyst screening. E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs) can natively operate on three-dimensional atomic coordinates under periodic boundary conditions and have demonstrated strong performance on such tasks. In contrast, language-model-based approaches, while enabling human-readable textual descriptions and reducing reliance on explicit graph -- thereby broadening applicability -- remain insufficient in both adsorption-configuration energy prediction accuracy and in distinguishing ``the same system with different configurations,'' even with graph-assisted pretraining in the style of GAP-CATBERTa.
  To this end, we propose QE-Catalytic, a multimodal framework that deeply couples a large language model (\textbf{Q}wen) with an E(3)-equivariant graph Transformer (\textbf{E}quiformer-V2), enabling unified support for adsorption-configuration property prediction and inverse design on complex catalytic surfaces. During prediction, QE-Catalytic jointly leverages three-dimensional structures and structured configuration text, and injects ``3D geometric information'' into the language channel via graph-text alignment, allowing it to function as a high-performance text-based predictor when precise coordinates are unavailable, while also autoregressively generating CIF files for target-energy-driven structure design and information completion. On OC20, QE-Catalytic reduces the MAE of relaxed adsorption energy from 0.713~eV to 0.486~eV, and consistently outperforms baseline models such as CatBERTa and GAP-CATBERTa across multiple evaluation protocols.

Abstract: The Multi-Armed Bandit problem provides a fundamental framework for analyzing the tension between exploration and exploitation in sequential learning. This paper explores Information Directed Sampling (IDS) policies, a class of heuristics that balance immediate regret against information gain. We focus on the tractable environment of two-state Bernoulli bandits as a minimal model to rigorously compare heuristic strategies against the optimal policy. We extend the IDS framework to the discounted infinite-horizon setting by introducing a modified information measure and a tuning parameter to modulate the decision-making behavior. We examine two specific problem classes: symmetric bandits and the scenario involving one fair coin. In the symmetric case we show that IDS achieves bounded cumulative regret, whereas in the one-fair-coin scenario the IDS policy yields a regret that scales logarithmically with the horizon, in agreement with classical asymptotic lower bounds. This work serves as a pedagogical synthesis, aiming to bridge concepts from reinforcement learning and information theory for an audience of statistical physicists.

Conclusion: 通过引入基于奖励得分的样本过滤机制，能够有效缓解离线强化学习中因低质量数据导致的学习困境，提升算法性能与效率。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn a policy that maximizes the expected return using a given static dataset of transitions. However, offline RL faces the distribution shift problem. The policy constraint offline RL method is proposed to solve the distribution shift problem. During the policy constraint offline RL training, it is important to ensure the difference between the learned policy and behavior policy within a given threshold. Thus, the learned policy heavily relies on the quality of the behavior policy. However, a problem exists in existing policy constraint methods: if the dataset contains many low-reward transitions, the learned will be contained with a suboptimal reference policy, leading to slow learning speed, low sample efficiency, and inferior performances. This paper shows that the sampling method in policy constraint offline RL that uses all the transitions in the dataset can be improved. A simple but efficient sample filtering method is proposed to improve the sample efficiency and the final performance. First, we evaluate the score of the transitions by average reward and average discounted reward of episodes in the dataset and extract the transition samples of high scores. Second, the high-score transition samples are used to train the offline RL algorithms. We verify the proposed method in a series of offline RL algorithms and benchmark tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuralCrop is a hybrid crop model combining process-based GGCMs with machine learning, trained to emulate a competitive GGCM and fine-tuned on observational data. It outperforms state-of-the-art GGCMs in simulating yield anomalies across regions and moisture conditions, especially under droughts, and maintains robust performance under unseen climate conditions, unlike pure ML models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing global gridded crop models (GGCMs) have high uncertainties due to incomplete understanding of biophysical processes, while pure machine learning models lack generalization ability under changing climates. A hybrid approach is needed to combine the strengths of both methods for more accurate and reliable crop yield projections.

Method: NeuralCrop integrates an advanced process-based GGCM with data-driven machine learning components. It is first trained to emulate a competitive GGCM and then fine-tuned using observational yield data. This allows it to leverage explicit biophysical process representation and data-driven pattern recognition.

Result: NeuralCrop significantly improves yield simulation accuracy over state-of-the-art GGCMs at site and regional scales, particularly under drought conditions in European wheat regions and the US Corn Belt (2000–2019). It maintains strong performance when extrapolating to unseen climate conditions, avoiding the degradation seen in pure machine learning models.

Conclusion: The hybrid NeuralCrop approach offers superior crop modeling capabilities and more reliable yield projections under climate change and extreme weather, demonstrating that integrating process-based knowledge with data-driven learning leads to more robust agricultural impact assessments.

Abstract: Global gridded crop models (GGCMs) simulate daily crop growth by explicitly representing key biophysical processes and project end-of-season yield time series. They are a primary tool to quantify the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity and assess associated risks for food security. Despite decades of development, state-of-the-art GGCMs still have substantial uncertainties in simulating complex biophysical processes due to limited process understanding. Recently, machine learning approaches trained on observational data have shown great potential in crop yield predictions. However, these models have not demonstrated improved performance over classical GGCMs and are not suitable for simulating crop yields under changing climate conditions due to problems in generalizing outside their training distributions. Here we introduce NeuralCrop, a hybrid GGCM that combines the strengths of an advanced process-based GGCM, resolving important processes explicitly, with data-driven machine learning components. The model is first trained to emulate a competitive GGCM before it is fine-tuned on observational data. We show that NeuralCrop outperforms state-of-the-art GGCMs across site-level and large-scale cropping regions. Across moisture conditions, NeuralCrop reproduces the interannual yield anomalies in European wheat regions and the US Corn Belt more accurately during the period from 2000 to 2019 with particularly strong improvements under drought extremes. When generalizing to conditions unseen during training, NeuralCrop continues to make robust projections, while pure machine learning models exhibit substantial performance degradation. Our results show that our hybrid crop modelling approach offers overall improved crop modeling and more reliable yield projections under climate change and intensifying extreme weather conditions.

Abstract: Federated learning across multi-cloud environments faces critical challenges, including non-IID data distributions, malicious participant detection, and substantial cross-cloud communication costs (egress fees). Existing Byzantine-robust methods focus primarily on model accuracy while overlooking the economic implications of data transfer across cloud providers. This paper presents Cost-TrustFL, a hierarchical federated learning framework that jointly optimizes model performance and communication costs while providing robust defense against poisoning attacks. We propose a gradient-based approximate Shapley value computation method that reduces the complexity from exponential to linear, enabling lightweight reputation evaluation. Our cost-aware aggregation strategy prioritizes intra-cloud communication to minimize expensive cross-cloud data transfers. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST datasets demonstrate that Cost-TrustFL achieves 86.7% accuracy under 30% malicious clients while reducing communication costs by 32% compared to baseline methods. The framework maintains stable performance across varying non-IID degrees and attack intensities, making it practical for real-world multi-cloud deployments.

Abstract: Simultaneous load forecasting across multiple entities (e.g., regions, buildings) is crucial for the efficient, reliable, and cost-effective operation of power systems. Accurate load forecasting is a challenging problem due to the inherent uncertainties in load demand, dynamic changes in consumption patterns, and correlations among entities. Multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful machine learning approach that enables the simultaneous learning across multiple related problems. However, its application to load forecasting remains underexplored and is limited to offline learning-based methods, which cannot capture changes in consumption patterns. This paper presents an adaptive multi-task learning method for probabilistic load forecasting. The proposed method can dynamically adapt to changes in consumption patterns and correlations among entities. In addition, the techniques presented provide reliable probabilistic predictions for loads of multiples entities and assess load uncertainties. Specifically, the method is based on vectorvalued hidden Markov models and uses a recursive process to update the model parameters and provide predictions with the most recent parameters. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using datasets that contain the load demand of multiple entities and exhibit diverse and dynamic consumption patterns. The experimental results show that the presented techniques outperform existing methods both in terms of forecasting performance and uncertainty assessment.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various image synthesis tasks, yet their tendency to replicate and amplify dataset biases remains poorly understood. Although previous research has viewed bias amplification as an inherent characteristic of diffusion models, this work provides the first analysis of how sampling algorithms and their hyperparameters influence bias amplification. We empirically demonstrate that samplers for diffusion models -- commonly optimized for sample quality and speed -- have a significant and measurable effect on bias amplification. Through controlled studies with models trained on Biased MNIST, Multi-Color MNIST and BFFHQ, and with Stable Diffusion, we show that sampling hyperparameters can induce both bias reduction and amplification, even when the trained model is fixed.

Abstract: Multimodal brain decoding aims to reconstruct semantic information that is consistent with visual stimuli from brain activity signals such as fMRI, and then generate readable natural language descriptions. However, multimodal brain decoding still faces key challenges in cross-subject generalization and interpretability. We propose a BrainROI model and achieve leading-level results in brain-captioning evaluation on the NSD dataset. Under the cross-subject setting, compared with recent state-of-the-art methods and representative baselines, metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr show clear improvements. Firstly, to address the heterogeneity of functional brain topology across subjects, we design a new fMRI encoder. We use multi-atlas soft functional parcellations (soft-ROI) as a shared space. We extend the discrete ROI Concatenation strategy in MINDLLM to a voxel-wise gated fusion mechanism (Voxel-gate). We also ensure consistent ROI mapping through global label alignment, which enhances cross-subject transferability. Secondly, to overcome the limitations of manual and black-box prompting methods in stability and transparency, we introduce an interpretable prompt optimization process. In a small-sample closed loop, we use a locally deployed Qwen model to iteratively generate and select human-readable prompts. This process improves the stability of prompt design and preserves an auditable optimization trajectory. Finally, we impose parameterized decoding constraints during inference to further improve the stability and quality of the generated descriptions.

Abstract: Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) provide a principled framework for modeling continuous-time stochastic processes and have been widely adopted in fields ranging from physics to finance. Recent advances suggest that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) offer a promising solution to learning the complex path distributions induced by SDEs. However, a critical bottleneck lies in designing a discriminator that faithfully captures temporal dependencies while remaining computationally efficient. Prior works have explored Neural Controlled Differential Equations (CDEs) as discriminators due to their ability to model continuous-time dynamics, but such architectures suffer from high computational costs and exacerbate the instability of adversarial training. To address these limitations, we introduce HGAN-SDEs, a novel GAN-based framework that leverages Neural Hermite functions to construct a structured and efficient discriminator. Hermite functions provide an expressive yet lightweight basis for approximating path-level dynamics, enabling both reduced runtime complexity and improved training stability. We establish the universal approximation property of our framework for a broad class of SDE-driven distributions and theoretically characterize its convergence behavior. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world systems demonstrate that HGAN-SDEs achieve superior sample quality and learning efficiency compared to existing generative models for SDEs

TL;DR: TableGPT-R1 is a specialized tabular model leveraging a systematic reinforcement learning framework to enhance complex, multi-step reasoning and robust code execution on structured data. It addresses challenges like scarce high-quality trajectories, heterogeneous feedback signals, and catastrophic forgetting through a data engineering pipeline, task-adaptive reward system, and multi-stage training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs fine-tuned via SFT struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning and reliable code execution on diverse table structures. RL offers potential but faces challenges in data scarcity, feedback heterogeneity, and knowledge retention during specialization.

Method: The approach includes a difficulty-stratified data synthesis pipeline for agentic trajectories, a task-adaptive reward system combining rule-based verification, criteria-injected reward modeling, step-level reward shaping, and behavioral regularization, along with a multi-stage training framework that first stabilizes general reasoning before specializing in table tasks.

Result: TableGPT-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on authoritative benchmarks, significantly outperforming baseline models while maintaining strong general capabilities. The model is publicly available on Hugging Face.

Conclusion: TableGPT-R1 effectively overcomes key limitations in applying RL to tabular data by integrating advanced data engineering, adaptive rewards, and staged training, enabling superior reasoning and execution on complex tables.

Abstract: Tabular data serves as the backbone of modern data analysis and scientific research. While Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) have significantly improved natural language interaction with such structured data, they often fall short in handling the complex, multi-step reasoning and robust code execution required for real-world table tasks. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising avenue to enhance these capabilities, yet its application in the tabular domain faces three critical hurdles: the scarcity of high-quality agentic trajectories with closed-loop code execution and environment feedback on diverse table structures, the extreme heterogeneity of feedback signals ranging from rigid SQL execution to open-ended data interpretation, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting of general knowledge during vertical specialization. To overcome these challenges and unlock advanced reasoning on complex tables, we introduce \textbf{TableGPT-R1}, a specialized tabular model built on a systematic RL framework. Our approach integrates a comprehensive data engineering pipeline that synthesizes difficulty-stratified agentic trajectories for both supervised alignment and RL rollouts, a task-adaptive reward system that combines rule-based verification with a criteria-injected reward model and incorporates process-level step reward shaping with behavioral regularization, and a multi-stage training framework that progressively stabilizes reasoning before specializing in table-specific tasks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TableGPT-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on authoritative benchmarks, significantly outperforming baseline models while retaining robust general capabilities. Our model is available at https://huggingface.co/tablegpt/TableGPT-R1.

*Mrinmay Sen,Subhrajit Nag*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedDPC is a novel federated learning method that mitigates both data heterogeneity and partial client participation by projecting local updates onto the previous global update and using adaptive scaling for faster convergence and improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data heterogeneity and partial client participation introduce variance in local and global model updates, leading to instability, poor convergence, and degraded model performance in federated learning. Existing methods focus mainly on data heterogeneity, leaving partial participation underexplored.

Method: FedDPC projects each local model update onto the previous global update to reduce variance and applies adaptive scaling to local updates before aggregation, improving convergence speed and model accuracy.

Result: Experiments on image classification tasks with heterogeneous datasets show FedDPC outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods in reducing training loss and achieving higher test accuracy across communication rounds.

Conclusion: FedDPC effectively addresses both data heterogeneity and partial client participation in federated learning, leading to more stable training, faster convergence, and superior global model performance.

Abstract: Data heterogeneity is a significant challenge in modern federated learning (FL) as it creates variance in local model updates, causing the aggregated global model to shift away from the true global optimum. Partial client participation in FL further exacerbates this issue by skewing the aggregation of local models towards the data distribution of participating clients. This creates additional variance in the global model updates, causing the global model to converge away from the optima of the global objective. These variances lead to instability in FL training, which degrades global model performance and slows down FL training. While existing literature primarily focuses on addressing data heterogeneity, the impact of partial client participation has received less attention. In this paper, we propose FedDPC, a novel FL method, designed to improve FL training and global model performance by mitigating both data heterogeneity and partial client participation. FedDPC addresses these issues by projecting each local update onto the previous global update, thereby controlling variance in both local and global updates. To further accelerate FL training, FedDPC employs adaptive scaling for each local update before aggregation. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks with multiple heterogeneously partitioned datasets validate the effectiveness of FedDPC. The results demonstrate that FedDPC outperforms state-of-the-art FL algorithms by achieving faster reduction in training loss and improved test accuracy across communication rounds.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了物理引导的机器学习在高能物理探测器模拟中的强大潜力，为未来复杂系统快速仿真提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Physics-based machine learning blends traditional science with modern data-driven techniques. Rather than relying exclusively on empirical data or predefined equations, this methodology embeds domain knowledge directly into the learning process, resulting in models that are both more accurate and robust. We leverage this paradigm to accelerate simulations of the Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) of the ALICE experiment at CERN. Our method introduces a novel loss function and an output variability-based scaling mechanism, which enhance the model's capability to accurately represent the spatial distribution and morphology of particle showers in detector outputs while mitigating the influence of rare artefacts on the training. Leveraging Normalizing Flows (NFs) in a teacher-student generative framework, we demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms classic data-driven model assimilation but also yields models that are 421 times faster than existing NF implementations in ZDC simulation literature.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种在物理域中计算注意力的Field-Space attention机制，用于地球系统Transformer模型，通过保持连续场表示和结构保形变形，实现高效、稳定且可解释的地球系统建模，显著优于传统Vision Transformer和U-Net方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习模型在处理地球系统连续场时缺乏对几何结构的保留，导致物理一致性差、可解释性低，且易出现优化不稳定性。

Method: 引入Field-Space attention，在球面连续场空间中直接计算注意力；采用固定非学习的多尺度分解，学习输入场的结构保形变形，实现粗细尺度信息融合。

Result: 在HEALPix网格上的全球温度超分辨率任务中，该模型收敛更快更稳定，参数量少，性能优于标准Vision Transformer和U-Net基线，且支持嵌入物理与统计先验，提升模型可靠性。

Conclusion: Field-Space Attention是一种紧凑、可解释、物理基础坚实的架构，适用于下一代地球系统预测与生成建模。

Abstract: Accurate and physically consistent modeling of Earth system dynamics requires machine-learning architectures that operate directly on continuous geophysical fields and preserve their underlying geometric structure. Here we introduce Field-Space attention, a mechanism for Earth system Transformers that computes attention in the physical domain rather than in a learned latent space. By maintaining all intermediate representations as continuous fields on the sphere, the architecture enables interpretable internal states and facilitates the enforcement of scientific constraints. The model employs a fixed, non-learned multiscale decomposition and learns structure-preserving deformations of the input field, allowing coherent integration of coarse and fine-scale information while avoiding the optimization instabilities characteristic of standard single-scale Vision Transformers. Applied to global temperature super-resolution on a HEALPix grid, Field-Space Transformers converge more rapidly and stably than conventional Vision Transformers and U-Net baselines, while requiring substantially fewer parameters. The explicit preservation of field structure throughout the network allows physical and statistical priors to be embedded directly into the architecture, yielding improved fidelity and reliability in data-driven Earth system modeling. These results position Field-Space Attention as a compact, interpretable, and physically grounded building block for next-generation Earth system prediction and generative modeling frameworks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Clust-PSI-PFL，一种基于聚类的个性化联邦学习框架，利用人口稳定性指数（PSI）量化非独立同分布（non-IID）数据程度，通过加权PSI（WPSI^L）实现更优的非IID度量。结合K-means++聚类与轮廓分析确定最优簇数，形成数据分布相似的客户端组。在六种数据集上验证，相比现有基线提升最高18%全局准确率，客户公平性相对改善37%，尤其在严重标签偏移下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中因客户端数据非独立同分布（non-IID）导致的模型更新偏差和性能下降问题，提升模型鲁棒性和客户端公平性。

Method: 使用加权人口稳定性指数（WPSI^L）量化数据非IID程度；基于PSI特征采用K-means++进行客户端聚类；通过轮廓系数法自动确定最优聚类数量；构建分布一致的客户端组以支持个性化联邦学习。

Result: 在六种不同模态（表格、图像、文本）的数据集、两种数据划分方式（Dirichlet和Similarity）及多种客户端规模下，相较于当前最佳基线，全局准确率最高提升18%，客户公平性相对提高37%，显著改善极端non-IID场景下的性能。

Conclusion: PSI引导的聚类机制是一种原理清晰、开销低的个性化联邦学习方法，能有效应对标签偏移下的非IID挑战，提升模型性能与公平性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) supports privacy-preserving, decentralized machine learning (ML) model training by keeping data on client devices. However, non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data across clients biases updates and degrades performance. To alleviate these issues, we propose Clust-PSI-PFL, a clustering-based personalized FL framework that uses the Population Stability Index (PSI) to quantify the level of non-IID data. We compute a weighted PSI metric, $WPSI^L$, which we show to be more informative than common non-IID metrics (Hellinger, Jensen-Shannon, and Earth Mover's distance). Using PSI features, we form distributionally homogeneous groups of clients via K-means++; the number of optimal clusters is chosen by a systematic silhouette-based procedure, typically yielding few clusters with modest overhead. Across six datasets (tabular, image, and text modalities), two partition protocols (Dirichlet with parameter $α$ and Similarity with parameter S), and multiple client sizes, Clust-PSI-PFL delivers up to 18% higher global accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines and markedly improves client fairness by a relative improvement of 37% under severe non-IID data. These results establish PSI-guided clustering as a principled, lightweight mechanism for robust PFL under label skew.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究利用真实电商网站的点击流数据，通过定义包括愤怒爆发、来回导航（U型转弯）、购物车流失、搜索挣扎和长时间漫游等规则来识别用户会话中的挫败感。基于540万条原始点击流事件（304,881个会话），构建了表格特征并训练了标准分类模型，同时使用完整事件序列训练了判别性LSTM分类器。XGBoost模型达到约90%准确率和0.9579的ROC AUC，而LSTM表现最佳，准确率达约91%，ROC AUC为0.9705。研究还发现，仅需前20至30次交互，LSTM即可可靠预测挫败感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多企业依赖其移动应用和网站，用户在这些渠道完成任务时的挫败感可能导致销售损失和投诉。因此，及时识别用户挫败感对提升用户体验和业务绩效至关重要。

Method: 从真实电商网站收集点击流数据，定义多种行为模式作为挫败感的判断标准；提取每个会话的表格特征，并训练XGBoost等传统分类模型；同时将完整事件序列输入到LSTM中进行判别性建模。此外，分析了早期交互阶段的预测能力。

Result: XGBoost模型取得约90%的准确率和0.9579的ROC AUC；LSTM模型表现更优，准确率达到约91%，ROC AUC为0.9705；且在仅使用前20至30次交互的情况下，LSTM已能可靠预测挫败感。

Conclusion: 基于点击流数据的深度学习方法（特别是LSTM）能够高效、早期地识别用户挫败感，有助于企业及时干预以改善用户体验和转化率。

Abstract: Many businesses depend on their mobile apps and websites, so user frustration while trying to complete a task on these channels can cause lost sales and complaints. In this research, I use clickstream data from a real e-commerce site to predict whether a session is frustrated or not. Frustration is defined using certain rules based on rage bursts, back and forth navigation (U turns), cart churn, search struggle, and long wandering sessions, and applies these rules to 5.4 million raw clickstream events (304,881 sessions). From each session, I build tabular features and train standard classifier models. I also use the full event sequence to train a discriminative LSTM classifier. XGBoost reaches about 90% accuracy, ROC AUC of 0.9579, while the LSTM performs best with about 91% accuracy and a ROC AUC of 0.9705. Finally, the research shows that with only the first 20 to 30 interactions, the LSTM already predicts frustration reliably.

TL;DR: SHAPformer 是一种基于 Transformer 架构的快速、准确且无需采样的可解释时间序列预测模型，通过注意力机制操作实现特征子集预测，生成解释速度远超传统 SHAP Permutation Explainer，且在合成与真实数据上均表现出良好性能与可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 SHAP 框架在时间序列应用中缺乏高效实现，且常假设特征独立性，限制了其在时间序列场景下的适用性与准确性。

Method: 提出 SHAPformer，利用 Transformer 架构中的注意力机制，通过操纵注意力权重来基于特征子集进行预测，从而避免传统采样方法，实现快速、无采样的可解释性推断。

Result: 在合成数据上，解释结果与真实解释高度一致；在真实电力负荷数据上，模型具有竞争力的预测性能，并揭示了历史负载为关键预测因子及圣诞节期间模型行为差异等有意义的洞察。

Conclusion: SHAPformer 有效解决了时间序列可解释性建模中的效率与准确性问题，显著提升了解释速度并提供可信的局部与全局洞察，适用于实际决策支持场景。

Abstract: Time-series forecasts are essential for planning and decision-making in many domains. Explainability is key to building user trust and meeting transparency requirements. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) is a popular explainable AI framework, but it lacks efficient implementations for time series and often assumes feature independence when sampling counterfactuals. We introduce SHAPformer, an accurate, fast and sampling-free explainable time-series forecasting model based on the Transformer architecture. It leverages attention manipulation to make predictions based on feature subsets. SHAPformer generates explanations in under one second, several orders of magnitude faster than the SHAP Permutation Explainer. On synthetic data with ground truth explanations, SHAPformer provides explanations that are true to the data. Applied to real-world electrical load data, it achieves competitive predictive performance and delivers meaningful local and global insights, such as identifying the past load as the key predictor and revealing a distinct model behavior during the Christmas period.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FailFast 是一种基于扩散语言模型（dLLM）的推测解码框架，通过动态调整推测长度，在难以推测的区域快速失败以减少延迟，在容易推测的区域大幅扩展推测长度以降低验证延迟，从而在不进行微调的情况下实现无损加速，最大提速达4.9倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散语言模型（dLLM）虽能并行生成文本，但其独立使用存在效率与质量之间的权衡。本文旨在利用dLLM的并行生成优势，克服传统推测解码中因高拒绝率导致的性能瓶颈，提升整体推理效率。

Method: 提出FailFast框架，利用dLLM作为推测器，结合自回归（AR）验证器，动态调节推测长度：在难推测区域快速放弃（fail fast），在易推测区域大胆扩展（win big），从而有效降低推测延迟和验证延迟。

Result: 无需微调，FailFast实现了对AR LLM的无损加速，相比基线解码最高提速4.9倍，优于最优秀的朴素dLLM推测器1.7倍，也超过EAGLE-3约1.4倍，在多种模型和任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: dLLM的并行特性可被巧妙用于推测解码，通过动态适应推测长度，显著提升推理速度。FailFast框架证明了这一思路的有效性，为高效大模型推理提供了新范式。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) offer fast, parallel token generation, but their standalone use is plagued by an inherent efficiency-quality tradeoff. We show that, if carefully applied, the attributes of dLLMs can actually be a strength for drafters in speculative decoding with autoregressive (AR) verifiers. Our core insight is that dLLM's speed from parallel decoding drastically lowers the risk of costly rejections, providing a practical mechanism to effectively realize the (elusive) lengthy drafts that lead to large speedups with speculative decoding. We present FailFast, a dLLM-based speculative decoding framework that realizes this approach by dynamically adapting its speculation length. It "fails fast" by spending minimal compute in hard-to-speculate regions to shrink speculation latency and "wins big" by aggressively extending draft lengths in easier regions to reduce verification latency (in many cases, speculating and accepting 70 tokens at a time!). Without any fine-tuning, FailFast delivers lossless acceleration of AR LLMs and achieves up to 4.9$\times$ speedup over vanilla decoding, 1.7$\times$ over the best naive dLLM drafter, and 1.4$\times$ over EAGLE-3 across diverse models and workloads. We open-source FailFast at https://github.com/ruipeterpan/failfast.

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对强化学习中因算法部署导致环境动态变化的性能影响问题，首次建立了相应的性能差异引理和策略梯度定理，并提出Performative Policy Gradient (PePG) 算法。该算法在softmax参数化下，无论是否加入熵正则化，均能收敛至自洽最优策略（即在自身引发的分布偏移下仍保持最优的策略），显著超越了以往仅追求稳定性的方法。实验验证了PePG在标准性能强化学习环境中的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法忽略算法部署后对环境的反馈影响，而实际应用中算法行为会改变环境动态，导致分布偏移，因此需要设计能应对这种‘性能性’（performativity）的新型算法。

Method: 推导并建立强化学习中的性能差异引理与策略梯度定理的性能性版本；提出新的策略梯度算法PePG，通过考虑策略对环境分布的影响来优化策略。

Result: PePG在softmax参数化及带/不带熵正则化的情况下，均能收敛到在自我诱导分布偏移下依然最优的策略；实验证明其优于标准策略梯度算法和现有追求稳定性的性能强化学习算法。

Conclusion: PePG是首个真正实现性能性最优的强化学习策略梯度算法，为解决算法部署引起的环境动态变化问题提供了理论与实践基础。

Abstract: Post-deployment machine learning algorithms often influence the environments they act in, and thus shift the underlying dynamics that the standard reinforcement learning (RL) methods ignore. While designing optimal algorithms in this performative setting has recently been studied in supervised learning, the RL counterpart remains under-explored. In this paper, we prove the performative counterparts of the performance difference lemma and the policy gradient theorem in RL, and further introduce the Performative Policy Gradient algorithm (PePG). PePG is the first policy gradient algorithm designed to account for performativity in RL. Under softmax parametrisation, and also with and without entropy regularisation, we prove that PePG converges to performatively optimal policies, i.e. policies that remain optimal under the distribution shifts induced by themselves. Thus, PePG significantly extends the prior works in Performative RL that achieves performative stability but not optimality. Furthermore, our empirical analysis on standard performative RL environments validate that PePG outperforms standard policy gradient algorithms and the existing performative RL algorithms aiming for stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手标签训练数据在机器学习任务中至关重要，但数据质量控制在文献中未受到足够重视，因为标注质量会因标注过程而显著变化。因此需要有效方法来评估和提升数据质量。

Method: 采用统计方法衡量标注一致性与同意度，分析多次标注迭代中的变化趋势，利用方差下降作为数据质量提升的指标；同时提出一种无需重复标注所有样本的高效数据收集方法，并考察标注员适应期的有效性。

Result: 多次标注迭代中的一致性指标方差下降能够可靠反映数据质量的提升；所提方法可在不依赖每项样本多次标注的情况下获取高质量数据；标注员的初始适应期不足以充分减少错误。

Conclusion: 通过统计方法评估标注一致性并利用多轮迭代数据，可有效提升手标签训练数据的质量；即使没有多重标注，也能通过优化流程获得高质量数据，且应超越仅依赖标注员适应期的做法。

Abstract: Hand-tagged training data is essential to many machine learning tasks. However, training data quality control has received little attention in the literature, despite data quality varying considerably with the tagging exercise. We propose methods to evaluate and enhance the quality of hand-tagged training data using statistical approaches to measure tagging consistency and agreement. We show that agreement metrics give more reliable results if recorded over multiple iterations of tagging, where declining variance in such recordings is an indicator of increasing data quality. We also show one way a tagging project can collect high-quality training data without requiring multiple tags for every work item, and that a tagger burn-in period may not be sufficient for minimizing tagger errors.

Conclusion: 通过在自回归模型内部表示中进行动作生成与强化学习，内部强化学习（Internal RL）展现出强大的潜力，为在基础模型中实现层次化强化学习提供了新路径。

Abstract: Large-scale autoregressive models pretrained on next-token prediction and finetuned with reinforcement learning (RL) have achieved unprecedented success on many problem domains. During RL, these models explore by generating new outputs, one token at a time. However, sampling actions token-by-token can result in highly inefficient learning, particularly when rewards are sparse. Here, we show that it is possible to overcome this problem by acting and exploring within the internal representations of an autoregressive model. Specifically, to discover temporally-abstract actions, we introduce a higher-order, non-causal sequence model whose outputs control the residual stream activations of a base autoregressive model. On grid world and MuJoCo-based tasks with hierarchical structure, we find that the higher-order model learns to compress long activation sequence chunks onto internal controllers. Critically, each controller executes a sequence of behaviorally meaningful actions that unfold over long timescales and are accompanied with a learned termination condition, such that composing multiple controllers over time leads to efficient exploration on novel tasks. We show that direct internal controller reinforcement, a process we term "internal RL", enables learning from sparse rewards in cases where standard RL finetuning fails. Our results demonstrate the benefits of latent action generation and reinforcement in autoregressive models, suggesting internal RL as a promising avenue for realizing hierarchical RL within foundation models.

Conclusion: 本研究成功构建了一个兼顾效率与公平的灾后救援物资分配优化框架。所提出的B&P算法具备良好的可扩展性和计算性能，适用于实际复杂场景。研究结果强调了在不同时间约束条件下选择合适优化策略的重要性，为未来应急物流系统的设计提供了理论支持与实践指导。

Abstract: The distribution of relief supplies to shelters is a critical aspect of post-disaster humanitarian logistics. In major disasters, prepositioned supplies often fall short of meeting all demands. We address the problem of planning vehicle routes from a distribution center to shelters while allocating limited relief supplies. To balance efficiency and equity, we formulate a bi-objective problem: minimizing a Gini-index-based measure of inequity in unsatisfied demand for fair distribution and minimizing total travel time for timely delivery. We propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and use the $ε$-constraint method to handle the bi-objective nature. By deriving mathematical properties of the optimal solution, we introduce valid inequalities and design an algorithm for optimal delivery allocations given feasible vehicle routes. A branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently. Computational tests on realistic datasets from a past earthquake in Van, Turkey, and predicted data for Istanbul's Kartal region show that the B&P algorithm significantly outperforms commercial MIP solvers. Our bi-objective approach reduces aid distribution inequity by 34% without compromising efficiency. Results indicate that when time constraints are very loose or tight, lexicographic optimization prioritizing demand coverage over fairness is effective. For moderately restrictive time constraints, a balanced approach is essential to avoid inequitable outcomes.

Abstract: Recent research has explored using very large language models (LLMs) as proxies for humans in tasks such as simulation, surveys, and studies. While LLMs do not possess a human psychology, they often can emulate human behaviors with sufficiently high fidelity to drive simulations to test human behavioral hypotheses, exhibiting more nuance and range than the rule-based agents often employed in behavioral economics. One key area of interest is the effect of personality on decision making, but the requirement that a prompt must be created for every tested personality profile introduces experimental overhead and degrades replicability. To address this issue, we leverage interpolative decoding, representing each dimension of personality as a pair of opposed prompts and employing an interpolation parameter to simulate behavior along the dimension. We show that interpolative decoding reliably modulates scores along each of the Big Five dimensions. We then show how interpolative decoding causes LLMs to mimic human decision-making behavior in economic games, replicating results from human psychological research. Finally, we present preliminary results of our efforts to ``twin'' individual human players in a collaborative game through systematic search for points in interpolation space that cause the system to replicate actions taken by the human subject.

Abstract: Intra-class variability is given according to the significance in the degree of dissimilarity between images within a class. In that sense, depending on its intensity, intra-class variability can hinder the learning process for DL models, specially when such classes are also underrepresented, which is a very common scenario in Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) tasks. This paper proposes a novel method that aims at leveraging classification performance in FGVC tasks by learning fine-grained features via classification of class-wise cluster assignments. Our goal is to apply clustering over each class individually, which can allow to discover pseudo-labels that encodes a latent degree of similarity between images. In turn, those labels can be employed in a hierarchical classification process that allows to learn more fine-grained visual features and thereby mitigating intra-class variability issues. Initial experiments over the PlantNet300k enabled to shed light upon several key points in which future work will have to be developed in order to find more conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of our method. Our method still achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PlantNet300k dataset even though some of its components haven't been shown to be fully optimized.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法局限于非具身社交推理或忽略社会因素的物理任务，无法全面衡量智能体在真实具身情境中协调物理与社会约束的能力。

Method: 设计S$^{3}$IT基准，基于由大语言模型驱动的NPC组成的3D环境中的座位安排任务，利用程序化生成框架创建多样化且可调控难度的场景，要求智能体通过主动对话获取偏好、自主探索环境并进行多目标优化。

Result: 当前最先进的大语言模型在该任务上表现不佳，与人类基线存在明显差距，暴露出其在空间智能方面的不足，但对具有明确文本线索的冲突解决仍能接近人类水平。

Conclusion: S$^{3}$IT有效揭示了当前大语言模型在具身社会智能方面的局限性，强调了发展融合空间理解与社会推理能力的重要性。

Abstract: The integration of embodied agents into human environments demands embodied social intelligence: reasoning over both social norms and physical constraints. However, existing evaluations fail to address this integration, as they are limited to either disembodied social reasoning (e.g., in text) or socially-agnostic physical tasks. Both approaches fail to assess an agent's ability to integrate and trade off both physical and social constraints within a realistic, embodied context. To address this challenge, we introduce Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test (S$^{3}$IT), a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate embodied social intelligence. It is centered on a novel and challenging seat-ordering task, requiring an agent to arrange seating in a 3D environment for a group of large language model-driven (LLM-driven) NPCs with diverse identities, preferences, and intricate interpersonal relationships. Our procedurally extensible framework generates a vast and diverse scenario space with controllable difficulty, compelling the agent to acquire preferences through active dialogue, perceive the environment via autonomous exploration, and perform multi-objective optimization within a complex constraint network. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on S$^{3}$IT and found that they still struggle with this problem, showing an obvious gap compared with the human baseline. Results imply that LLMs have deficiencies in spatial intelligence, yet simultaneously demonstrate their ability to achieve near human-level competence in resolving conflicts that possess explicit textual cues.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于流匹配的新型方法 \lieflow，用于直接从数据中学习对称性，特别适用于发现离散对称群（如反射），并解决了对称模式排列导致的‘最后时刻收敛’问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解物理系统和提升机器学习性能需要识别数据中的底层对称性；现有方法在灵活性和假设要求上存在局限，因此需要更通用且低假设的对称性发现方法。

Method: 通过在李群上进行流匹配，将对称性发现建模为学习一个更大的假设群上的分布，使其与数据中观察到的对称性相匹配，并引入新的插值方案以解决收敛问题。

Result: 在二维和三维点云数据上成功发现了离散对称群，包括复数域上的反射对称；所提方法具有更强的灵活性和更低的先验假设。

Conclusion: \lieflow 方法能够有效、灵活地从数据中发现对称性，克服了传统方法的局限性，尤其在处理复杂对称结构时表现出色。

Abstract: Symmetry is fundamental to understanding physical systems, and at the same time, can improve performance and sample efficiency in machine learning. Both pursuits require knowledge of the underlying symmetries in data. To address this, we propose learning symmetries directly from data via flow matching on Lie groups. We formulate symmetry discovery as learning a distribution over a larger hypothesis group, such that the learned distribution matches the symmetries observed in data. Relative to previous works, our method, \lieflow, is more flexible in terms of the types of groups it can discover and requires fewer assumptions. Experiments on 2D and 3D point clouds demonstrate the successful discovery of discrete groups, including reflections by flow matching over the complex domain. We identify a key challenge where the symmetric arrangement of the target modes causes ``last-minute convergence,'' where samples remain stationary until relatively late in the flow, and introduce a novel interpolation scheme for flow matching for symmetry discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型虽能生成逼真的视觉预测，但难以转化为低层动作；而潜变量动作模型通常仅支持单步操作且缺乏高层规划能力。因此需要一种能够结合视觉动态与动作语义、支持高阶规划并易于映射到实际动作的方法。

Method: 提出SOF框架，利用光流构建中间表示，学习一个基于运动信息的潜变量技能空间，从而实现从无标签视频中自动提取可组合的技能，并支持高层规划与动作转化。

Conclusion: SOF成功弥合了视频生成与动作执行之间的鸿沟，为通用机器人提供了从海量视频数据中学习复杂技能的新途径。

Abstract: Learning from videos offers a promising path toward generalist robots by providing rich visual and temporal priors beyond what real robot datasets contain. While existing video generative models produce impressive visual predictions, they are difficult to translate into low-level actions. Conversely, latent-action models better align videos with actions, but they typically operate at the single-step level and lack high-level planning capabilities. We bridge this gap by introducing Skill Abstraction from Optical Flow (SOF), a framework that learns latent skills from large collections of action-free videos. Our key idea is to learn a latent skill space through an intermediate representation based on optical flow that captures motion information aligned with both video dynamics and robot actions. By learning skills in this flow-based latent space, SOF enables high-level planning over video-derived skills and allows for easier translation of these skills into actions. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves performance in both multitask and long-horizon settings, demonstrating the ability to acquire and compose skills directly from raw visual data.

Abstract: As Earth's climate changes, it is impacting disasters and extreme weather events across the planet. Record-breaking heat waves, drenching rainfalls, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense. Rapid and efficient response to disaster events is essential for climate resilience and sustainability. A key challenge in disaster response is to accurately and quickly identify disaster locations to support decision-making and resources allocation. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Cross-view Geolocalization approach, called ProbGLC, exploring new pathways towards generative location awareness for rapid disaster response. Herein, we combine probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models into a unified framework to simultaneously enhance model explainability (via uncertainty quantification) and achieve state-of-the-art geolocalization performance. Designed for rapid diaster response, the ProbGLC is able to address cross-view geolocalization across multiple disaster events as well as to offer unique features of probabilistic distribution and localizability score. To evaluate the ProbGLC, we conduct extensive experiments on two cross-view disaster datasets (i.e., MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster), consisting diverse cross-view imagery pairs of multiple disaster types (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires, floods, to tornadoes). Preliminary results confirms the superior geolocalization accuracy (i.e., 0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km) and model explainability (i.e., via probabilistic distributions and localizability scores) of the proposed ProbGLC approach, highlighting the great potential of leveraging generative cross-view approach to facilitate location awareness for better and faster disaster response.

Conclusion: 强化学习是实现高效、高精度内容审核的有效路径，尤其适用于标注成本高或政策复杂的实际场景，为工业级内容治理系统提供了可落地的解决方案。

Abstract: Content moderation at scale remains one of the most pressing challenges in today's digital ecosystem, where billions of user- and AI-generated artifacts must be continuously evaluated for policy violations. Although recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for policy-grounded moderation, the practical challenges of training these systems to achieve expert-level accuracy in real-world settings remain largely unexplored, particularly in regimes characterized by label sparsity, evolving policy definitions, and the need for nuanced reasoning beyond shallow pattern matching. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical investigation of scaling reinforcement learning (RL) for content classification, systematically evaluating multiple RL training recipes and reward-shaping strategies-including verifiable rewards and LLM-as-judge frameworks-to transform general-purpose language models into specialized, policy-aligned classifiers across three real-world content moderation tasks. Our findings provide actionable insights for industrial-scale moderation systems, demonstrating that RL exhibits sigmoid-like scaling behavior in which performance improves smoothly with increased training data, rollouts, and optimization steps before gradually saturating. Moreover, we show that RL substantially improves performance on tasks requiring complex policy-grounded reasoning while achieving up to 100x higher data efficiency than supervised fine-tuning, making it particularly effective in domains where expert annotations are scarce or costly.

TL;DR: Reason2Decide 是一种两阶段训练框架，旨在解决大型语言模型在临床决策支持中因暴露偏差导致的解释与预测不一致问题。第一阶段专注生成理由，第二阶段联合训练标签预测与理由生成，并使用调度采样逐步从依赖真实标签过渡到模型自身预测。该方法在三个医疗数据集上表现优异，不仅提升了预测准确率（F1）和理由保真度（如BERTScore、BLEU、LLM-as-a-Judge），还在分诊任务中展现出对不同来源理由的鲁棒性。即使仅使用LLM生成的理由进行预训练，其性能仍优于其他微调方法，表明无需大量人工标注即可有效训练。此外，该方法所用模型仅为当前基础模型的1/40，显著降低资源需求，使可解释的临床推理更适用于资源受限环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前临床决策支持系统在利用大语言模型时面临预测准确性和解释一致性之间的矛盾，尤其受暴露偏差影响，导致生成的解释与实际预测不匹配。因此亟需一种能够自洽生成高质量解释并保持高预测性能的方法。

Method: 提出两阶段训练框架：第一阶段仅训练模型生成理由；第二阶段联合训练标签预测与理由生成，并采用调度采样机制，逐步减少对真实标签的依赖，增强模型自我一致性。

Result: 在多个医学数据集上，Reason2Decide 在预测性能（F1）和解释质量（BERTScore、BLEU、LLM-as-a-Judge）方面均优于现有微调基线和部分零样本大模型；在分诊任务中对多种理由来源具有鲁棒性；仅使用LLM生成理由即可达到良好效果，且模型规模仅为同类基础模型的1/40。

Conclusion: Reason2Decide 通过两阶段训练与调度采样有效缓解了暴露偏差和任务分离问题，实现了高精度与高解释一致性并重，同时大幅降低计算资源需求，为资源受限场景下的可解释临床决策支持提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Despite the wide adoption of Large Language Models (LLM)s, clinical decision support systems face a critical challenge: achieving high predictive accuracy while generating explanations aligned with the predictions. Current approaches suffer from exposure bias leading to misaligned explanations. We propose Reason2Decide, a two-stage training framework that addresses key challenges in self-rationalization, including exposure bias and task separation. In Stage-1, our model is trained on rationale generation, while in Stage-2, we jointly train on label prediction and rationale generation, applying scheduled sampling to gradually transition from conditioning on gold labels to model predictions. We evaluate Reason2Decide on three medical datasets, including a proprietary triage dataset and public biomedical QA datasets. Across model sizes, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity (BERTScore, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge). In triage, Reason2Decide is rationale source-robust across LLM-generated, nurse-authored, and nurse-post-processed rationales. In our experiments, while using only LLM-generated rationales in Stage-1, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning variants. This indicates that LLM-generated rationales are suitable for pretraining models, reducing reliance on human annotations. Remarkably, Reason2Decide achieves these gains with models 40x smaller than contemporary foundation models, making clinical reasoning more accessible for resource-constrained deployments while still providing explainable decision support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多依赖微调特定模块来桥接时间序列数据与大语言模型之间的差距，但完全冻结的预训练模型对输入文本表示极为敏感，难以适应分布变化。因此，亟需一种不依赖微调、仅通过优化输入表示即可提升性能的策略。

Method: 在时间序列数据进入文本化处理前，加入随机噪声作为推理时的数据增强手段，使模型学习更鲁棒的时间动态特征；同时构建两个未被任何所用大语言模型覆盖的全新时间序列数据集，确保评估公平性。

Result: 实验表明，该噪声注入策略显著提升了完全冻结大语言模型在多种时间序列预测任务上的表现，尤其在新数据集上优势明显，证明了其对分布偏移的强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过简单而有效的噪声注入机制，可显著提升零样本时间序列预测中完全冻结大语言模型的性能，为直接利用现成大语言模型提供了新的可行路径，推动了无需微调的通用时间序列建模发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness as zero-shot time series (TS) forecasters. The key challenge lies in tokenizing TS data into textual representations that align with LLMs' pre-trained knowledge. While existing work often relies on fine-tuning specialized modules to bridge this gap, a distinct, yet challenging, paradigm aims to leverage truly off-the-shelf LLMs without any fine-tuning whatsoever, relying solely on strategic tokenization of numerical sequences. The performance of these fully frozen models is acutely sensitive to the textual representation of the input data, as their parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet highly effective strategy to overcome this brittleness: injecting noise into the raw time series before tokenization. This non-invasive intervention acts as a form of inference-time augmentation, compelling the frozen LLM to extrapolate based on robust underlying temporal patterns rather than superficial numerical artifacts. We theoretically analyze this phenomenon and empirically validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks. Notably, to fully eliminate potential biases from data contamination during LLM pre-training, we introduce two novel TS datasets that fall outside all utilized LLMs' pre-training scopes, and consistently observe improved performance. This study provides a further step in directly leveraging off-the-shelf LLMs for time series forecasting.

Abstract: Data centers account for significant global energy consumption and a carbon footprint. The recent increasing demand for edge computing and AI advancements drives the growth of data center storage capacity. Energy efficiency is a cost-effective way to combat climate change, cut energy costs, improve business competitiveness, and promote IT and environmental sustainability. Thus, optimizing data center energy management is the most important factor in the sustainability of the world. Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is used to represent the operational efficiency of the data center. Predicting PUE using Neural Networks provides an understanding of the effect of each feature on energy consumption, thus enabling targeted modifications of those key features to improve energy efficiency. In this paper, we have developed Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) based PUE prediction model and compared the model performance with GRU. The data set comprises 52,560 samples with 117 features using EnergyPlus, simulating a DC in Singapore. Sets of the most relevant features are selected using the Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) algorithm for different parameter settings. These feature sets are used to find the optimal hyperparameter configuration and train the BiGRU model. The performance of the optimized BiGRU-based PUE prediction model is then compared with that of GRU using mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared metrics.

Abstract: We compare human and large language model (LLM) generalization in the number game, a concept inference task. Using a Bayesian model as an analytical framework, we examined the inductive biases and inference strategies of humans and LLMs. The Bayesian model captured human behavior better than LLMs in that humans flexibly infer rule-based and similarity-based concepts, whereas LLMs rely more on mathematical rules. Humans also demonstrated a few-shot generalization, even from a single example, while LLMs required more samples to generalize. These contrasts highlight the fundamental differences in how humans and LLMs infer and generalize mathematical concepts.

Previous works on safe RL from human feedback (RLHF) first learn reward and cost models from offline data, then use constrained RL to optimize a safe policy. While such an approach works in the contextual bandits settings (LLMs), in long horizon continuous control tasks, errors in rewards and costs accumulate, leading to impairment in performance when used with constrained RL methods. To address these challenges, (a) instead of indirectly learning policies (from rewards and costs), we introduce a framework that learns a policy directly based on pairwise preferences regarding the agent's behavior in terms of rewards, as well as binary labels indicating the safety of trajectory segments; (b) we propose \textsc{PreSa} (Preference and Safety Alignment), a method that combines preference learning module with safety alignment in a constrained optimization problem. This optimization problem is solved within a Lagrangian paradigm that directly learns reward-maximizing safe policy \textit{without explicitly learning reward and cost models}, avoiding the need for constrained RL; (c) we evaluate our approach on continuous control tasks with both synthetic and real human feedback. Empirically, our method successfully learns safe policies with high rewards, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, and offline safe RL approaches with ground-truth reward and cost.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly advances, especially in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), research focus is shifting from single-modality text processing to the more complex domains of multimodal and embodied AI. Embodied intelligence focuses on training agents within realistic simulated environments, leveraging physical interaction and action feedback rather than conventionally labeled datasets. Yet, most existing simulation platforms remain narrowly designed, each tailored to specific tasks. A versatile, general-purpose training environment that can support everything from low-level embodied navigation to high-level composite activities, such as multi-agent social simulation and human-AI collaboration, remains largely unavailable. To bridge this gap, we introduce TongSIM, a high-fidelity, general-purpose platform for training and evaluating embodied agents.

Conclusion: ActionFlow 通过系统级优化实现了 VLA 模型在资源受限边缘平台上的高效推理，显著提升控制频率，推动了 VLA 模型在真实动态环境中的实际应用。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a unified paradigm for robotic perception and control, enabling emergent generalization and long-horizon task execution. However, their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments is severely hin dered by high inference latency. While smooth robotic interaction requires control frequencies of 20 to 30 Hz, current VLA models typi cally operate at only 3-5 Hz on edge devices due to the memory bound nature of autoregressive decoding. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise model accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ActionFlow, a system-level inference framework tailored for resource-constrained edge plat forms. At the core of ActionFlow is a Cross-Request Pipelin ing strategy, a novel scheduler that redefines VLA inference as a macro-pipeline of micro-requests. The strategy intelligently batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across continuous time steps to maximize hardware utilization. Furthermore, to support this scheduling, we propose a Cross Request State Packed Forward operator and a Unified KV Ring Buffer, which fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations. Experimental results demonstrate that ActionFlow achieves a 2.55x improvement in FPS on the OpenVLA-7B model without retraining, enabling real-time dy namic manipulation on edge hardware.

Abstract: A global shortage of radiologists has been exacerbated by the significant volume of chest X-ray workloads, particularly in primary care. Although multimodal large language models show promise, existing evaluations predominantly rely on automated metrics or retrospective analyses, lacking rigorous prospective clinical validation. Janus-Pro-CXR (1B), a chest X-ray interpretation system based on DeepSeek Janus-Pro model, was developed and rigorously validated through a multicenter prospective trial (NCT07117266). Our system outperforms state-of-the-art X-ray report generation models in automated report generation, surpassing even larger-scale models including ChatGPT 4o (200B parameters), while demonstrating reliable detection of six clinically critical radiographic findings. Retrospective evaluation confirms significantly higher report accuracy than Janus-Pro and ChatGPT 4o. In prospective clinical deployment, AI assistance significantly improved report quality scores, reduced interpretation time by 18.3% (P < 0.001), and was preferred by a majority of experts in 54.3% of cases. Through lightweight architecture and domain-specific optimization, Janus-Pro-CXR improves diagnostic reliability and workflow efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained settings. The model architecture and implementation framework will be open-sourced to facilitate the clinical translation of AI-assisted radiology solutions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究比较了GatorTron-Base、Llama 8B、Mistral 7B等大语言模型（LLMs）与BioBERT、DocBERT等小型语言模型（SLMs）在预测危重患者休克方面的表现，使用MIMIC-III数据库中17,294例ICU住院患者的文本数据，通过住院时长和休克指数（SI > 0.7）筛选出正常与异常样本。研究采用焦点损失和交叉熵损失以缓解类别不平衡问题。结果显示，尽管GatorTron Base在加权召回率上达到80.5%最高，但总体性能在LLMs与SLMs间无显著差异，表明LLMs在预测临床事件方面并不天然优于SLMs。未来应更关注开发能预测临床轨迹的模型，而非仅聚焦于命名实体识别或表型分类等简单任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）已在自然语言处理任务中取得显著进展，但在预测性临床任务中的应用仍不充分。及时预测休克可促进早期干预，改善患者预后，因此亟需评估LLMs在该场景下的有效性，并探索其相较于传统小型语言模型（SLMs）的优势与局限。

Method: 基于MIMIC-III数据库，选取17,294例重症患者记录，依据住院时长>24小时及休克指数（SI）>0.7筛选出355名正常与87名异常患者。对比包括GatorTron-Base、Llama 8B、Mistral 7B在内的多个大型语言模型与BioBERT、DocBERT、Word2Vec、Doc2Vec等小型语言模型。训练过程中采用焦点损失与交叉熵损失以应对类别不平衡问题，评估模型在预测休克方面的性能。

Result: GatorTron-Base在加权召回率上达到80.5%，为所有模型中最高；但整体性能指标在大语言模型与小型语言模型之间无显著差异，表明大语言模型在预测临床事件方面并未展现出明显优势。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在预测未来临床事件方面并不天然优于小型语言模型，尽管其在文本理解任务中表现优异。为实现真正临床价值，未来训练应侧重于构建能预测临床轨迹的模型，而非局限于命名实体识别或表型分类等基础任务。

Abstract: With the advent of LLMs, various tasks across the natural language processing domain have been transformed. However, their application in predictive tasks remains less researched. This study compares large language models, including GatorTron-Base (trained on clinical data), Llama 8B, and Mistral 7B, against models like BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec, setting benchmarks for predicting Shock in critically ill patients. Timely prediction of shock can enable early interventions, thus improving patient outcomes. Text data from 17,294 ICU stays of patients in the MIMIC III database were scored for length of stay > 24 hours and shock index (SI) > 0.7 to yield 355 and 87 patients with normal and abnormal SI-index, respectively. Both focal and cross-entropy losses were used during finetuning to address class imbalances. Our findings indicate that while GatorTron Base achieved the highest weighted recall of 80.5%, the overall performance metrics were comparable between SLMs and LLMs. This suggests that LLMs are not inherently superior to SLMs in predicting future clinical events despite their strong performance on text-based tasks. To achieve meaningful clinical outcomes, future efforts in training LLMs should prioritize developing models capable of predicting clinical trajectories rather than focusing on simpler tasks such as named entity recognition or phenotyping.

Abstract: Teachers' emotional states are critical in educational scenarios, profoundly impacting teaching efficacy, student engagement, and learning achievements. However, existing studies often fail to accurately capture teachers' emotions due to the performative nature and overlook the critical impact of instructional information on emotional expression.In this paper, we systematically investigate teacher sentiment analysis by building both the dataset and the model accordingly. We construct the first large-scale teacher multimodal sentiment analysis dataset, T-MED.To ensure labeling accuracy and efficiency, we employ a human-machine collaborative labeling process.The T-MED dataset includes 14,938 instances of teacher emotional data from 250 real classrooms across 11 subjects ranging from K-12 to higher education, integrating multimodal text, audio, video, and instructional information.Furthermore, we propose a novel asymmetric attention-based multimodal teacher sentiment analysis model, AAM-TSA.AAM-TSA introduces an asymmetric attention mechanism and hierarchical gating unit to enable differentiated cross-modal feature fusion and precise emotional classification. Experimental results demonstrate that AAM-TSA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability on the T-MED dataset.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal LLMs and systems that use tools for long-video QA point to the promise of reasoning over hour-long episodes. However, many methods still compress content into lossy summaries or rely on limited toolsets, weakening temporal grounding and missing fine-grained cues. We propose a multi-agent framework in which a master LLM coordinates a grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments and a vision agent to extract targeted textual observations. The master agent plans with a step limit, and is trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation. This design helps the master agent focus on relevant clips via grounding, complements subtitles with visual detail, and yields interpretable trajectories. On our proposed LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ which are episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+, our multi-agent system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines. Experiments also show reinforcement learning further strengthens reasoning and planning for the trained agent. Code and data will be shared at https://longvideoagent.github.io/.
