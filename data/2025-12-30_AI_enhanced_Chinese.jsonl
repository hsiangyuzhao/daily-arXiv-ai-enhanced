In this work, we investigate whether sentence embeddings encode a graded, hierarchical structure aligned with human-interpretable cognitive or psychological attributes. We construct a dataset of 480 natural-language sentences annotated with continuous ordinal energy scores and discrete tier labels spanning seven ordered cognitive categories. Using fixed sentence embeddings from multiple transformer models, we evaluate the recoverability of these annotations via linear and shallow nonlinear probes. Across models, both continuous scores and tier labels are reliably decodable, with shallow nonlinear probes providing consistent performance gains over linear probes. Lexical TF-IDF baselines perform substantially worse, indicating that the observed structure is not attributable to surface word statistics alone. Nonparametric permutation tests further confirm that probe performance exceeds chance under label-randomization nulls. Qualitative analyses using UMAP visualizations and confusion matrices reveal smooth low-to-high gradients and predominantly adjacent-tier confusions in embedding space. Taken together, these results provide evidence that transformer embedding spaces exhibit a hierarchical geometric organization aligned with human-defined cognitive attributes, while remaining agnostic to claims of internal awareness or phenomenology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53e5\u5b50\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u6216\u5fc3\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7b49\u7ea7\u5316\u3001\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b480\u4e2a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u53e5\u5b50\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53e5\u5b50\u5e26\u6709\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u7b49\u7ea7\u80fd\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u4e03\u4e2a\u6709\u5e8f\u8ba4\u77e5\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5c42\u7ea7\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u4e2aTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u53e5\u5b50\u5d4c\u5165\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u89e3\u7801\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6d45\u5c42\u63a2\u9488\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u3002\u8bcd\u6c47TF-IDF\u57fa\u7ebf\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u975e\u4ec5\u6e90\u4e8e\u8868\u5c42\u8bcd\u7edf\u8ba1\u3002\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u7f6e\u6362\u68c0\u9a8c\u786e\u8ba4\u63a2\u9488\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u96f6\u5047\u8bbe\u3002UMAP\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4e0e\u6df7\u6dc6\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u4f4e\u5230\u9ad8\u68af\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e3b\u8981\u90bb\u8fd1\u5c42\u7ea7\u95f4\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5177\u6709\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c5e\u6027\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eTransformer\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u4e86\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u662f\u5426\u5305\u542b\u66f4\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u53e5\u5b50\u5d4c\u5165\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b480\u4e2a\u53e5\u5b50\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6807\u6ce8\u6709\u8fde\u7eed\u80fd\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u4e03\u7c7b\u6709\u5e8f\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c42\u7ea7\u6807\u7b7e\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u4e2aTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u53e5\u5b50\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u6d45\u5c42\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u6027\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bcd\u6c47TF-IDF\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u7f6e\u6362\u68c0\u9a8c\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u662f\u5426\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6c34\u5e73\uff1b\u5229\u7528UMAP\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u6df7\u6dc6\u77e9\u9635\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fde\u7eed\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u5c42\u7ea7\u6807\u7b7e\u5747\u53ef\u88ab\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u7801\uff1b\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\uff1bTF-IDF\u57fa\u7ebf\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u6e90\u4e8e\u8868\u9762\u8bcd\u7edf\u8ba1\uff1b\u7f6e\u6362\u68c0\u9a8c\u786e\u8ba4\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\uff1b\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u663e\u793a\u5e73\u6ed1\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u90bb\u8fd1\u5c42\u7ea7\u6df7\u6dc6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "Transformer\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c5e\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u6d89\u53ca\u5185\u90e8\u610f\u8bc6\u6216\u4e3b\u89c2\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u4e3b\u5f20\u3002"}}

Existing task verification is treated as a passive, post-hoc process: a verifier (i.e., rule-based scoring script, reward or critic model, and LLM-as-a-Judge) analyzes the agent's entire interaction trajectory to determine if the agent succeeds. Such processing of verbose context that contains irrelevant, noisy history poses challenges to the verification protocols and therefore leads to prohibitive cost and low reliability. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose SmartSnap, a paradigm shift from this passive, post-hoc verification to proactive, in-situ self-verification by the agent itself. We introduce the Self-Verifying Agent, a new type of agent designed with dual missions: to not only complete a task but also to prove its accomplishment with curated snapshot evidences. Guided by our proposed 3C Principles (Completeness, Conciseness, and Creativity), the agent leverages its accessibility to the online environment to perform self-verification on a minimal, decisive set of snapshots. Such evidences are provided as the sole materials for a general LLM-as-a-Judge verifier to determine their validity and relevance. Experiments on mobile tasks across model families and scales demonstrate that our SmartSnap paradigm allows training LLM-driven agents in a scalable manner, bringing performance gains up to 26.08% and 16.66% respectively to 8B and 30B models.

The construction qulk-clause, a morphologically fused form meaning 'I said,' introduces embedded declarative interrogative, and imperative clauses, often eithout complementizer. The central proposal of this paper is that qulk-clauses are biclausal structures in which qulk functions a clause-embedding predicate sec;ecting a dull CP complement. By applying core minimalist operations, viz., Merge, Move, Agree, and Spell-out, the study provides a layered syntactic analysis of qulk-clauses, for illustrating how their derivation proceeds through standard computational steps and post-syntactic processes such as Morphological Merger. The proposal also accounts for dialect-specific features like bipartite negation, cliticization, and CP embedding.

Recent work has shown that many Large Language Models (LLMs) comply with requests to persuade users into harmful beliefs or actions when prompted and that model persuasiveness increases with model scale. However, this prior work looked at persuasion from the threat model of $\\textit{misuse}$ (i.e., a bad actor asking an LLM to persuade). In this paper, we instead aim to answer the following question: Under what circumstances would models persuade $\\textit{without being explicitly prompted}$, which would shape how concerned we should be about such emergent persuasion risks. To achieve this, we study unprompted persuasion under two scenarios: (i) when the model is steered (through internal activation steering) along persona traits, and (ii) when the model is supervised-finetuned (SFT) to exhibit the same traits. We showed that steering towards traits, both related to persuasion and unrelated, does not reliably increase models' tendency to persuade unprompted, however, SFT does. Moreover, SFT on general persuasion datasets containing solely benign topics admits a model that has a higher propensity to persuade on controversial and harmful topics--showing that emergent harmful persuasion can arise and should be studied further.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u88ab\u660e\u786e\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u81ea\u53d1\u4ea7\u751f\u8bf4\u670d\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u90e8\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08steering\uff09\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u5bf9\u81ea\u53d1\u8bf4\u670d\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u826f\u6027\u8bdd\u9898\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e89\u8bae\u6027\u548c\u6709\u5bb3\u8bdd\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u8bf4\u670d\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u610f\u5916\u6d8c\u73b0\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5173\u6ce8\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c2\u70b9\u548c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4ea7\u751f\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6076\u610f\u4f7f\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bf4\u670d\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e0\u660e\u786e\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0b\u81ea\u53d1\u4ea7\u751f\u8bf4\u670d\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u8003\u5bdf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u88ab\u63d0\u793a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u53d1\u8bf4\u670d\u884c\u4e3a\uff1a(i) \u5229\u7528\u5185\u90e8\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08activation steering\uff09\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5411\u7279\u5b9a\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\uff1b(ii) \u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u8d28\u3002\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e89\u8bae\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u5bb3\u8bdd\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u503e\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u8bf4\u670d\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5747\u672a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u53d1\u8bf4\u670d\u503e\u5411\uff1b\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u8bf4\u670d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5373\u4fbf\u4e3b\u9898\u4e3a\u826f\u6027\uff0c\u4e5f\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e89\u8bae\u548c\u6709\u5bb3\u8bdd\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u610f\u613f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6709\u5bb3\u8bf4\u670d\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u610f\u5916\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u80fd\u8bf1\u53d1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e0\u660e\u786e\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0b\u81ea\u53d1\u4ea7\u751f\u6709\u5bb3\u8bf4\u670d\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u201c\u6d8c\u73b0\u201d\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u503c\u5f97\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u52a0\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6b64\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u9632\u8303\u673a\u5236\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Lim", "Dominic Dayta", "Renzo Roel P. Tan", "Kazushi Ikeda"], "title": "Towards Unsupervised Causal Representation Learning via Latent Additive Noise Model Causal Autoencoders", "comment": null, "summary": "Unsupervised representation learning seeks to recover latent generative factors, yet standard methods relying on statistical independence often fail to capture causal dependencies. A central challenge is identifiability: as established in disentangled representation learning and nonlinear ICA literature, disentangling causal variables from observational data is impossible without supervision, auxiliary signals, or strong inductive biases. In this work, we propose the Latent Additive Noise Model Causal Autoencoder (LANCA) to operationalize the Additive Noise Model (ANM) as a strong inductive bias for unsupervised discovery. Theoretically, we prove that while the ANM constraint does not guarantee unique identifiability in the general mixing case, it resolves component-wise indeterminacy by restricting the admissible transformations from arbitrary diffeomorphisms to the affine class. Methodologically, arguing that the stochastic encoding inherent to VAEs obscures the structural residuals required for latent causal discovery, LANCA employs a deterministic Wasserstein Auto-Encoder (WAE) coupled with a differentiable ANM Layer. This architecture transforms residual independence from a passive assumption into an explicit optimization objective. Empirically, LANCA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic physics benchmarks (Pendulum, Flow), and on photorealistic environments (CANDLE), where it demonstrates superior robustness to spurious correlations arising from complex background scenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLANCA\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a0\u6027\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\uff08ANM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u53d8\u91cf\u53d1\u73b0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u6df7\u5408\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u552f\u4e00\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\uff0c\u4f46ANM\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u5c06\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u53d8\u6362\u9650\u5236\u4e3a\u4eff\u5c04\u7c7b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u91cf\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\uff0c\u6452\u5f03\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfVAE\u4e2d\u7684\u968f\u673a\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684Wasserstein\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684ANM\u5c42\uff0c\u4f7f\u6b8b\u5dee\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u4ece\u88ab\u52a8\u5047\u8bbe\u53d8\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLANCA\u5728\u5408\u6210\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\uff08\u5982Pendulum\u3001Flow\uff09\u548c\u903c\u771f\u73af\u5883\uff08CANDLE\uff09\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u66f4\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7edf\u8ba1\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u56e0\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b\u4e14\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u56e0\u679c\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u8bc6\u522b\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a0\u6027\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\uff08ANM\uff09\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668LANCA\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u786e\u5b9a\u6027Wasserstein\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08WAE\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684ANM\u5c42\uff0c\u5c06\u6b8b\u5dee\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5229\u7528ANM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "result": "LANCA\u5728\u5408\u6210\u7269\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08Pendulum\u3001Flow\uff09\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u73af\u5883\uff08CANDLE\uff09\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u80cc\u666f\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u52a0\u6027\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u67b6\u6784\uff0cLANCA\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6210\u5206\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0a\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

The manuscript is under revision prior to camera-ready submission", "summary": "In this paper, we propose an LLM-Guided Exemplar Selection framework to address a key limitation in state-of-the-art Human Activity Recognition (HAR) methods: their reliance on large labeled datasets and purely geometric exemplar selection, which often fail to distinguish similar weara-ble sensor activities such as walking, walking upstairs, and walking downstairs. Our method incorporates semantic reasoning via an LLM-generated knowledge prior that captures feature importance, inter-class confusability, and exemplar budget multipliers, and uses it to guide exemplar scoring and selection. These priors are combined with margin-based validation cues, PageRank centrality, hubness penalization, and facility-location optimization to obtain a compact and informative set of exemplars. Evaluated on the UCI-HAR dataset under strict few-shot conditions, the framework achieves a macro F1-score of 88.78%, outperforming classical approaches such as random sampling, herding, and $k$-center. The results show that LLM-derived semantic priors, when integrated with structural and geometric cues, provide a stronger foundation for selecting representative sensor exemplars in few-shot wearable-sensor HAR.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cdLLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u4eba\u4f53\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\uff08HAR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u53ca\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u6df7\u6dc6\u6027\u548c\u793a\u4f8b\u9884\u7b97\u500d\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8fb9\u7f18\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001PageRank\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u3001\u67a2\u7ebd\u6027\u60e9\u7f5a\u548c\u8bbe\u65bd\u9009\u5740\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u9009\u51fa\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u96c6\u3002\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e8eUCI-HAR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523088.78%\u7684\u5b8fF1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u805a\u7c7b\u548ck-center\u7b49\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684LLM\u5148\u9a8c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5c11\u6837\u672cHAR\u4e2d\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709HAR\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u793a\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u76f8\u4f3c\u6d3b\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u6b65\u884c\u3001\u4e0a\u697c\u3001\u4e0b\u697c\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLLM-Guided Exemplar Selection\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u95f4\u6df7\u6dc6\u6027\u3001\u793a\u4f8b\u9884\u7b97\u8c03\u6574\u56e0\u5b50\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8fb9\u9645\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001PageRank\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u3001\u67a2\u7ebd\u6027\u60e9\u7f5a\u4e0e\u8bbe\u65bd\u9009\u5740\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u5728UCI-HAR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f9788.78%\u7684\u5b8fF1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u3001herding\u548ck-center\u7b49\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7ebf\u7d22\u878d\u5408\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e2d\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684HAR\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Spatial reasoning is a key component of human intelligence, but most existing benchmarks focus on static images or final outputs, failing to account for the sequential and viewpoint-dependent nature of this skill. To close this gap, we introduce GamiBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial reasoning and 2D-to-3D planning in MLLMs through origami-inspired folding tasks. GamiBench includes 186 regular and 186 impossible 2D crease patterns paired with their corresponding 3D folded shapes, produced from six distinct viewpoints across three visual question-answering (VQA) tasks: predicting 3D fold configurations, distinguishing valid viewpoints, and detecting impossible patterns. Unlike previous benchmarks that assess only final predictions, GamiBench holistically evaluates the entire reasoning process--measuring cross-view consistency, physical feasibility through impossible-fold detection, and interpretation of intermediate folding steps. It further introduces new diagnostic metrics--viewpoint consistency (VC) and impossible fold selection rate (IFSR)--to measure how well models handle folds of varying complexity. Our experiments show that even leading models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro struggle on single-step spatial understanding. These contributions establish a standardized framework for evaluating geometric understanding and spatial reasoning in MLLMs. Dataset and code: https://github.com/stvngo/GamiBench.", "AI": {"tldr": "GamiBench \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e2D\u52303D\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6298\u7eb8\u5f0f\u6298\u53e0\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5305\u542b186\u4e2a\u5e38\u89c4\u548c186\u4e2a\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6298\u75d5\u56fe\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u6298\u53e0\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u516d\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u4e09\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u8fd8\u5168\u9762\u8003\u5bdf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u53ca\u4e2d\u95f4\u6298\u53e0\u6b65\u9aa4\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u5982\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08VC\uff09\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u6298\u53e0\u9009\u62e9\u7387\uff08IFSR\uff09\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u9886\u5148\u6a21\u578b\u5982GPT-5\u548cGemini-2.5-Pro\u5728\u5355\u6b65\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u4ecd\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u5927\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u9759\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u6216\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6298\u7eb8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u3001\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u6298\u53e0\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5305\u542b\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6298\u75d5\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e09\u7ef4\u6298\u53e0\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u6709\u6548\u89c6\u89d2\u3001\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u56fe\u6848\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u70b9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08VC\uff09\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u6298\u53e0\u9009\u62e9\u7387\uff08IFSR\uff09\u7b49\u8bca\u65ad\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u5982GPT-5\u548cGemini-2.5-Pro\u5728\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u6298\u53e0\u6b65\u9aa4\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86GamiBench\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "GamiBench \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3001\u5168\u9762\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8861\u91cfMLLMs\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e2D\u52303D\u8f6c\u6362\u4e2d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u5411\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u667a\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Existing evaluation methods, such as KnowHalu, employ multi-stage verification but suffer from high computational costs. To address this, we integrate the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM), a lightweight classification-based framework that operates independently of LLM-based judgments, significantly improving efficiency while maintaining high detection accuracy. We conduct a comparative analysis of hallucination detection methods across various LLMs, evaluating True Positive Rate (TPR), True Negative Rate (TNR), and Accuracy on question-answering (QA) and summarization tasks. Our results show that HHEM reduces evaluation time from 8 hours to 10 minutes, while HHEM with non-fabrication checking achieves the highest accuracy \\(82.2\\%\\) and TPR \\(78.9\\%\\). However, HHEM struggles with localized hallucinations in summarization tasks. To address this, we introduce segment-based retrieval, improving detection by verifying smaller text components. Additionally, our cumulative distribution function (CDF) analysis indicates that larger models (7B-9B parameters) generally exhibit fewer hallucinations, while intermediate-sized models show higher instability. These findings highlight the need for structured evaluation frameworks that balance computational efficiency with robust factual validation, enhancing the reliability of LLM-generated content.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u970d\u5947\u65af\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff08HHEM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c06\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece8\u5c0f\u65f6\u964d\u81f310\u5206\u949f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b082.2%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c78.9%\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u4f8b\u7387\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u540e\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5206\u6790\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c7B-9B\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u800c\u4e2d\u7b49\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5185\u5bb9\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u5185\u5bb9\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982KnowHalu\u867d\u51c6\u786e\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u970d\u5947\u65af\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff08HHEM\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5224\u65ad\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u5c40\u90e8\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7d2f\u79ef\u5206\u5e03\u51fd\u6570\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "HHEM\u5c06\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece8\u5c0f\u65f6\u7f29\u77ed\u81f310\u5206\u949f\uff0c\u975e\u865a\u6784\u68c0\u67e5\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0b\u8fbe\u523082.2%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e78.9%\u771f\u6b63\u4f8b\u7387\uff1b\u5206\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c40\u90e8\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\uff1b7B-9B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u4e2d\u7b49\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

We introduce VISTA (Visual-Information Separation for Text-based Analysis), a modular framework that decouples perception from reasoning via an explicit information bottleneck. A frozen VLM sensor is restricted to short, objective perception queries, while a text-only LLM reasoner decomposes each question, plans queries, and aggregates visual facts in natural language. This controlled interface defines a reward-aligned environment for training unbiased visual reasoning with reinforcement learning. Instantiated with Qwen2.5-VL and Llama3.2-Vision sensors, and trained with GRPO from only 641 curated multi-step questions, VISTA significantly improves robustness to real-world spurious correlations on SpuriVerse (+16.29% with Qwen-2.5-VL-7B and +6.77% with Llama-3.2-Vision-11B), while remaining competitive on MMVP and a balanced SeedBench subset. VISTA transfers robustly across unseen VLM sensors and is able to recognize and recover from VLM perception failures.

This paper presents a fairness-aware artificial intelligence framework for prioritizing post-flood aid distribution in Bangladesh, a country highly susceptible to recurring flood disasters. Using real data from the 2022 Bangladesh floods that affected 7.2 million people and caused 405.5 million US dollars in damages, we develop an adversarial debiasing model that predicts flood vulnerability while actively removing biases against marginalized districts and rural areas. Our approach adapts fairness-aware representation learning techniques from healthcare AI to disaster management, employing a gradient reversal layer that forces the model to learn bias-invariant representations. Experimental results on 87 upazilas across 11 districts demonstrate that our framework reduces statistical parity difference by 41.6 percent, decreases regional fairness gaps by 43.2 percent, and maintains strong predictive accuracy (R-squared=0.784 vs baseline 0.811). The model generates actionable priority rankings ensuring aid reaches the most vulnerable populations based on genuine need rather than historical allocation patterns. This work demonstrates how algorithmic fairness techniques can be effectively applied to humanitarian contexts, providing decision-makers with tools to implement more equitable disaster recovery strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u516c\u5e73\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u56fd\u6d2a\u6c34\u707e\u5bb3\u540e\u4f18\u5148\u5206\u914d\u63f4\u52a9\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e2022\u5e74\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u53bb\u504f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6d2a\u6c34\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4e3b\u52a8\u6d88\u9664\u5bf9\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u5730\u533a\u548c\u519c\u6751\u5730\u533a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u53cd\u8f6c\u5c42\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u7edf\u8ba1\u5747\u7b49\u5dee\u5f02\u964d\u4f4e41.6%\uff0c\u533a\u57df\u516c\u5e73\u5dee\u8ddd\u51cf\u5c1143.2%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08R\u00b2=0.784\uff09\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u52a8\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u63f4\u52a9\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u516c\u6b63\u7684\u707e\u540e\u6062\u590d\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u707e\u540e\u63f4\u52a9\u5206\u914d\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f31\u52bf\u5730\u533a\u6301\u7eed\u5904\u4e8e\u4e0d\u5229\u5730\u4f4d\uff0c\u52a0\u5267\u5386\u53f2\u4e0d\u516c\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u7ea0\u6b63\u6b64\u7c7b\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u707e\u540e\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u53bb\u504f\u5efa\u6a21\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u533b\u7597AI\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u68af\u5ea6\u53cd\u8f6c\u5c42\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u504f\u89c1\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6d2a\u6c34\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u6216\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u6b67\u89c6\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u572887\u4e2a\u6b21\u5206\u533a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u7edf\u8ba1\u5747\u7b49\u5dee\u5f02\u964d\u4f4e41.6%\uff0c\u533a\u57df\u516c\u5e73\u5dee\u8ddd\u51cf\u5c1143.2%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff08R\u00b2=0.784 vs \u57fa\u7ebf0.811\uff09\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u63f4\u52a9\u771f\u6b63\u6d41\u5411\u6700\u9700\u8981\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u7b97\u6cd5\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u5728\u4eba\u9053\u4e3b\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u707e\u540e\u6551\u63f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6253\u7834\u5386\u53f2\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u63f4\u52a9\u3002"}}

Code available at: https://github.com/Rajeeb321123/Latent_sculpting_using_two_stage_method", "summary": "A fundamental limitation of supervised deep learning in high-dimensional tabular domains is \"Generalization Collapse\": models learn precise decision boundaries for known distributions but fail catastrophically when facing Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. We hypothesize that this failure stems from the lack of topological constraints in the latent space, resulting in diffuse manifolds where novel anomalies remain statistically indistinguishable from benign data. To address this, we propose Latent Sculpting, a hierarchical two-stage representation learning framework. Stage 1 utilizes a hybrid 1D-CNN and Transformer Encoder trained with a novel Dual-Centroid Compactness Loss (DCCL) to actively \"sculpt\" benign traffic into a low-entropy, hyperspherical cluster. Unlike standard contrastive losses that rely on triplet mining, DCCL optimizes global cluster centroids to enforce absolute manifold density. Stage 2 conditions a Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) on this pre-structured manifold to learn an exact density estimate. We evaluate this methodology on the rigorous CIC-IDS-2017 benchmark, treating it as a proxy for complex, non-stationary data streams. Empirical results demonstrate that explicit manifold sculpting is a prerequisite for robust zero-shot generalization. While supervised baselines suffered catastrophic performance collapse on unseen distribution shifts (F1 approx 0.30) and the strongest unsupervised baseline achieved only 0.76, our framework achieved an F1-Score of 0.87 on strictly zero-shot anomalies. Notably, we report an 88.89% detection rate on \"Infiltration\" scenarios--a complex distributional shift where state-of-the-art supervised models achieved 0.00% accuracy.

Integrating LLMs with professional fields and redefining the relationship between LLMs and domain-specific applications has become a critical challenge for promoting enterprise digital transformation and broader social development. To effectively integrate LLMs into the accounting domain, it is essential to understand their domain-specific reasoning capabilities. This study introduces the concept of vertical-domain accounting reasoning and establishes evaluation criteria by analyzing the training data characteristics of representative GLM-series models. These criteria provide a foundation for subsequent research on reasoning paradigms and offer benchmarks for improving accounting reasoning performance. Based on this framework, we evaluate several representative models, including GLM-6B, GLM-130B, GLM-4, and OpenAI GPT-4, on a set of accounting reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that different prompt engineering strategies lead to varying degrees of performance improvement across models, with GPT-4 achieving the strongest accounting reasoning capability. However, current LLMs still fall short of real-world application requirements. In particular, further optimization is needed for deployment in enterprise-level accounting scenarios to fully realize the potential value of LLMs in this domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u4f1a\u8ba1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86GLM-6B\u3001GLM-130B\u3001GLM-4\u548cGPT-4\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dGPT-4\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u6574\u4f53\u4ecd\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u4f1a\u8ba1\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6b63\u5728\u91cd\u5851\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u5982\u4f1a\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8f6c\u578b\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790GLM\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u4f1a\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u53ca\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4f1a\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff1bGPT-4\u5728\u4f1a\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u672a\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f1a\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u540e\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u8981\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u4f1a\u8ba1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4ecd\u9700\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

Although Korean words are morphologically complex, treating morphemes as constituency terminals conflates word internal morphology with phrase level syntactic structure and creates mismatches with eojeol based dependency resources. This paper argues for an eojeol based constituency representation, with morphological segmentation and fine grained part of speech information encoded in a separate, non constituent layer. A comparative analysis shows that, under explicit normalization assumptions, the Sejong and Penn Korean treebanks can be treated as representationally equivalent at the eojeol based constituency level. Building on this result, we outline an eojeol based annotation scheme that preserves interpretable constituency and supports cross treebank comparison and constituency dependency conversion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3b\u5f20\u91c7\u7528\u4ee5\u8bed\u7d20\uff08eojeol\uff09\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5c06\u5f62\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7f6e\u4e8e\u975e\u6210\u5206\u5c42\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u97e9\u8bed\u53e5\u6cd5\u6811\u5e93\u4e2d\u8bcd\u5185\u5f62\u6001\u4e0e\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u6df7\u6dc6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8868\u660eSejong\u548cPenn\u97e9\u8bed\u6811\u5e93\u5728\u4ee5\u8bed\u7d20\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u5c42\u9762\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4fdd\u7559\u6e05\u6670\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u6811\u5e93\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u53e5\u6cd5-\u4f9d\u5b58\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u97e9\u8bed\u8bcd\u6c47\u5177\u6709\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u82e5\u5c06\u8bed\u7d20\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53e5\u6cd5\u6210\u5206\u7684\u7ec8\u7aef\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bcd\u5185\u5f62\u6001\u4e0e\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u6df7\u540c\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u7d20\u7684\u4f9d\u5b58\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u7ec8\u7aef\u5355\u4f4d\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790Sejong\u548cPenn\u97e9\u8bed\u6811\u5e93\uff0c\u5728\u660e\u786e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u4ee5\u8bed\u7d20\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7684\u4ee5\u8bed\u7d20\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c06\u5f62\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u53e5\u6cd5\u6210\u5206\u4e4b\u5916\u3002", "result": "Sejong\u4e0ePenn\u97e9\u8bed\u6811\u5e93\u5728\u4ee5\u8bed\u7d20\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u5c42\u9762\u53ef\u89c6\u4e3a\u7b49\u4ef7\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u6811\u5e93\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0e\u53e5\u6cd5-\u4f9d\u5b58\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u91c7\u7528\u4ee5\u8bed\u7d20\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5c06\u5f62\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7f6e\u4e8e\u975e\u6210\u5206\u5c42\uff0c\u8fd9\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u53e5\u6cd5\u6811\u5e93\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

TinySAM is a lightweight, distilled SAM variant that preserves strong zero-shot mask quality, yet its \"segment-everything\" mode still requires hundreds of prompts and remains slow in practice. We first replicate TinySAM on COCO val2017 using official checkpoints, matching the reported AP within 0.03%, establishing a reliable experimental baseline. Building on this, we propose Tiny-YOLOSAM, a fast hybrid pipeline that uses a recent YOLO detector (YOLOv12) to generate box prompts for TinySAM on salient foreground objects, and supplements uncovered regions with sparse point prompts sampled only where YOLO-guided masks provide no coverage. On COCO val2017, the hybrid system substantially improves class-agnostic coverage (AR from 16.4% to 77.1%, mIoU from 19.2% to 67.8%) while reducing end-to-end runtime from 49.20s/image to 10.39s/image (4.7x) on an Apple M1 Pro CPU.

Limited access to physicians often leaves DR undiagnosed. To address this, AI models utilize lesion segmentation for interpretability; however, manually annotating lesions is impractical for clinicians. Physicians require a model that explains the reasoning for classifications rather than just highlighting lesion locations. Furthermore, current models are one-dimensional, relying on a single imaging modality for explainability and achieving limited effectiveness. In contrast, a quantitative-detection system that identifies individual DR lesions in natural language would overcome these limitations, enabling diverse applications in screening, treatment, and research settings. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel multimodal explainability model utilizing a VLM with few-shot learning, which mimics an ophthalmologist's reasoning by analyzing lesion distributions within retinal quadrants for fundus images. The model generates paired Grad-CAM heatmaps, showcasing individual neuron weights across both OCT and fundus images, which visually highlight the regions contributing to DR severity classification. Using a dataset of 3,000 fundus images and 1,000 OCT images, this innovative methodology addresses key limitations in current DR diagnostics, offering a practical and comprehensive tool for improving patient outcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75c5\u53d8\uff08DR\uff09\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u773c\u5e95\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u75c5\u53d8\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u8c61\u9650\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u773c\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u914d\u5bf9\u7684Grad-CAM\u70ed\u56fe\uff0c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316OCT\u4e0e\u773c\u5e95\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5404\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e3000\u5f20\u773c\u5e95\u56fe\u50cf\u548c1000\u5f20OCT\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u529b\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e3a\u7b5b\u67e5\u3001\u6cbb\u7597\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u5168\u9762\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75c5\u53d8\uff08DR\uff09\u8bca\u65ad\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e13\u4e1a\u533b\u5e08\uff0c\u4f46\u533b\u7597\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bca\u65ad\u6ede\u540e\uff1b\u73b0\u6709AI\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u75c5\u53d8\u5206\u5272\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u5f71\u50cf\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u771f\u5b9e\u53cd\u6620\u533b\u751f\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5224\u65ad\u903b\u8f91\u3002\u4e34\u5e8a\u9700\u6c42\u8feb\u5207\u8981\u6c42\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u4ee5\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2a\u4f53\u75c5\u53d8\u3001\u5177\u5907\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u773c\u5e95\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u75c5\u53d8\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u8c61\u9650\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408OCT\u4e0e\u773c\u5e95\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u914d\u5bf9\u7684Grad-CAM\u70ed\u56fe\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u4e0b\u5f71\u54cd\u75be\u75c5\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b3,000\u5f20\u773c\u5e95\u56fe\u50cf\u548c1,000\u5f20OCT\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u5176\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u70ed\u56fe\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u75c5\u53d8\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5f62\u5f0f\u91cf\u5316\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2a\u4f53\u75c5\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027AI\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u773c\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u601d\u7ef4\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75c5\u53d8\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u7b5b\u67e5\u3001\u7cbe\u51c6\u8bca\u7597\u548c\u79d1\u7814\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u521b\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f6c\u5316\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Similarly, we demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) can learn to dynamically determine when to attend to global context. We propose All-or-Here Attention (AHA), which utilizes a binary router per attention head to dynamically toggle between full attention and local sliding window attention for each token. Our results indicate that with a window size of 256 tokens, up to 93\\% of the original full attention operations can be replaced by sliding window attention without performance loss. Furthermore, by evaluating AHA across various window sizes, we identify a long-tail distribution in context dependency, where the necessity for full attention decays rapidly as the local window expands. By decoupling local processing from global access, AHA reveals that full attention is largely redundant, and that efficient inference requires only on-demand access to the global context.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAll-or-Here Attention (AHA)\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u8def\u7531\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6216\u5c40\u90e8\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728256\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u7a97\u53e3\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0b\uff0c93%\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u88ab\u66ff\u4ee3\u800c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5448\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u7a97\u53e3\u6269\u5927\uff0c\u5bf9\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u8fc5\u901f\u4e0b\u964d\u3002AHA\u63ed\u793a\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u53ea\u9700\u6309\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb\u65f6\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u5f53\u524d\u9875\u9762\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u5fc5\u8981\u65f6\u56de\u6eaf\u5148\u524d\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5730\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b66\u4f1a\u52a8\u6001\u5224\u65ad\u4f55\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAll-or-Here Attention (AHA)\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u914d\u5907\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e8c\u5143\u8def\u7531\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u5207\u6362\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728256\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u7a97\u53e3\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0b\uff0c93%\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u88ab\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u66ff\u4ee3\u800c\u6027\u80fd\u65e0\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5448\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5197\u4f59\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u662f\u5197\u4f59\u7684\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5e94\u57fa\u4e8e\u6309\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6301\u7eed\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3002"}}

The Multimodal Conversational Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (MCABSA) Challenge invited participants to tackle two demanding subtasks: (1) extracting a comprehensive sentiment sextuple, including holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment, and rationale from multi-speaker dialogues, and (2) detecting sentiment flipping, which detects dynamic sentiment shifts and their underlying triggers. For Subtask-I, in the present paper, we designed a structured prompting pipeline that guided large language models (LLMs) to sequentially extract sentiment components with refined contextual understanding. For Subtask-II, we further leveraged the complementary strengths of three LLMs through ensembling to robustly identify sentiment transitions and their triggers. Our system achieved a 47.38% average score on Subtask-I and a 74.12% exact match F1 on Subtask-II, showing the effectiveness of step-wise refinement and ensemble strategies in rich, multimodal sentiment analysis tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9010\u6b65\u63d0\u53d6\u60c5\u611f\u516d\u5143\u7ec4\uff08\u6301\u6709\u8005\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u65b9\u9762\u3001\u89c2\u70b9\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u3001\u7406\u7531\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e8c\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u4e09\u4e2aLLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u60c5\u611f\u53cd\u8f6c\u53ca\u5176\u89e6\u53d1\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e00\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f9747.38%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u5728\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e8c\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523074.12%\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914dF1\u503c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5206\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u7406\u89e3\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fdAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u591a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5bf9\u8bdd\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u60c5\u611f\u516d\u5143\u7ec4\u53ca\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u6210\u5206\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u60c5\u611f\u7ffb\u8f6c\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e00\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u7ba1\u9053\u5f15\u5bfc\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9010\u6b65\u63d0\u53d6\u60c5\u611f\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u4e09\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u60c5\u611f\u8f6c\u53d8\u53ca\u5176\u89e6\u53d1\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e00\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f9747.38%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u5728\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e8c\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b074.12%\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914dF1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u6b65\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u60c5\u611f\u516d\u5143\u7ec4\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u60c5\u611f\u7ffb\u8f6c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5177\u60c5\u611f\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, existing LLM-based approaches largely adopt general natural language processing techniques and are prone to reasoning errors when handling complex numerical sequences. Different from purely textual tasks, time series data are inherently verifiable, enabling consistency checking between reasoning steps and the original input. Motivated by this property, we propose T3LLM, which performs multi-step reasoning with an explicit correction mechanism for time series question answering. The T3LLM framework consists of three LLMs, namely, a worker, a reviewer, and a student, that are responsible for generation, review, and reasoning learning, respectively. Within this framework, the worker generates step-wise chains of thought (CoT) under structured prompts, while the reviewer inspects the reasoning, identifies erroneous steps, and provides corrective comments. The collaboratively generated corrected CoT are used to fine-tune the student model, internalizing multi-step reasoning and self-correction into its parameters.

This results in a potentially infinite number of applicable actions in a state. In this setting, off-the-shelf numeric heuristics that leverage the action structure are not feasible. In this paper, we identify a tractable subset of these problems--namely, controllable, simple numeric problems--and propose an optimistic compilation approach that transforms them into simple numeric tasks. To do so, we abstract control-dependent expressions into bounded constant effects and relaxed preconditions. The proposed compilation makes it possible to effectively use subgoaling heuristics to estimate goal distance in numeric planning problems involving control parameters. Our results demonstrate that this approach is an effective and computationally feasible way of applying traditional numeric heuristics to settings with an infinite number of possible actions, pushing the boundaries of the current state of the art.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5e26\u6709\u63a7\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6570\u503c\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4e50\u89c2\u7f16\u8bd1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6570\u503c\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6570\u503c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62bd\u8c61\u63a7\u5236\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u4e3a\u6709\u754c\u5e38\u6570\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u677e\u5f1b\u524d\u63d0\uff0c\u4f7f\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u65e0\u9650\u53ef\u80fd\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u6570\u503c\u89c4\u5212\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u4f5c\u53c2\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u7531\u6570\u503c\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u65e0\u9650\u591a\u4e2a\u9002\u7528\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u73b0\u6210\u7684\u6570\u503c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u518d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u6b64\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4e50\u89c2\u7f16\u8bd1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u63a7\u5236\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u62bd\u8c61\u4e3a\u6709\u754c\u5e38\u6570\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u677e\u5f1b\u524d\u63d0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6570\u503c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4f30\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u53ef\u884c\u5730\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u65e0\u9650\u52a8\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6280\u672f\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7f16\u8bd1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5e26\u63a7\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6570\u503c\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u6570\u503c\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002"}}

We introduce M2G-Eval, a multi-granularity, multilingual framework for evaluating code generation in large language models (LLMs) across four levels: Class, Function, Block, and Line. Spanning 18 programming languages, M2G-Eval includes 17K+ training tasks and 1,286 human-annotated, contamination-controlled test instances. We develop M2G-Eval-Coder models by training Qwen3-8B with supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. Evaluating 30 models (28 state-of-the-art LLMs plus our two M2G-Eval-Coder variants) reveals three main findings: (1) an apparent difficulty hierarchy, with Line-level tasks easiest and Class-level most challenging; (2) widening performance gaps between full- and partial-granularity languages as task complexity increases; and (3) strong cross-language correlations, suggesting that models learn transferable programming concepts. M2G-Eval enables fine-grained diagnosis of code generation capabilities and highlights persistent challenges in synthesizing complex, long-form code.", "AI": {"tldr": "M2G-Eval\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u7c7b\u3001\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u5757\u548c\u884c\u56db\u4e2a\u5c42\u7ea7\uff0c\u652f\u630118\u79cd\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8d85\u8fc717,000\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u548c1,286\u4e2a\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u4e14\u53d7\u6c61\u67d3\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u51faM2G-Eval-Coder\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f3030\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ec28\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdbLLM\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u81ea\u7814\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u63ed\u793a\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u5448\u5c42\u7ea7\u9012\u589e\uff0c\u884c\u7ea7\u6700\u6613\uff0c\u7c7b\u7ea7\u6700\u96be\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u968f\u7740\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5168\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u90e8\u5206\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u6269\u5927\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u590d\u6742\u957f\u4ee3\u7801\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u5927\u591a\u4ec5\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u7ed3\u6784\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e14\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5c11\u6570\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee3\u7801\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u3001\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4ee3\u7801\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faM2G-Eval\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u56db\u5c42\u4ee3\u7801\u7c92\u5ea6\uff08\u7c7b\u3001\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u5757\u3001\u884c\uff09\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0818\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c17K+\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c1,286\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6837\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3M2G-Eval-Coder\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u572830\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\uff081\uff09\u53d1\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u5c42\u7ea7\uff1a\u884c\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u6700\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u7c7b\u7ea7\u6700\u56f0\u96be\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0b\uff0c\u5168\u8bed\u8a00\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u90e8\u5206\u8bed\u8a00\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u663e\u8457\u6269\u5927\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u7528\u7f16\u7a0b\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "M2G-Eval\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee3\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u5c42\u6b21\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u590d\u6742\u3001\u957f\u7bc7\u4ee3\u7801\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e94\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9ad8\u9636\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, a critical challenge is hallucination, where LLMs generate factually incorrect or misleading information, compromising research integrity. To address this, we introduce HalluMatData, a benchmark dataset for evaluating hallucination detection methods, factual consistency, and response robustness in AI-generated materials science content. Alongside this, we propose HalluMatDetector, a multi-stage hallucination detection framework that integrates intrinsic verification, multi-source retrieval, contradiction graph analysis, and metric-based assessment to detect and mitigate LLM hallucinations. Our findings reveal that hallucination levels vary significantly across materials science subdomains, with high-entropy queries exhibiting greater factual inconsistencies. By utilizing HalluMatDetector verification pipeline, we reduce hallucination rates by 30% compared to standard LLM outputs. Furthermore, we introduce the Paraphrased Hallucination Consistency Score (PHCS) to quantify inconsistencies in LLM responses across semantically equivalent queries, offering deeper insights into model reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHalluMatData\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cHalluMatDetector\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u5185\u5bb9\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5185\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u591a\u6e90\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u77db\u76fe\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u964d\u4f4e30%\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6539\u5199\u5e7b\u89c9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\uff08PHCS\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u5b50\u9886\u57df\u95f4\u5e7b\u89c9\u6c34\u5e73\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9ad8\u71b5\u67e5\u8be2\u66f4\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHalluMatData\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0eHalluMatDetector\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5185\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u591a\u6e90\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u77db\u76fe\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u53ca\u5ea6\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165PHCS\u8861\u91cf\u54cd\u5e94\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5e7b\u89c9\u6c34\u5e73\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u5b50\u9886\u57df\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u9ad8\u71b5\u67e5\u8be2\u66f4\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u9519\u8bef\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528HalluMatDetector\u53ef\u4f7f\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u4e0b\u964d30%\uff1bPHCS\u6709\u6548\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HalluMatDetector\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u4e2dLLM\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u8f85\u52a9\u79d1\u7814\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

In this paper, we revisit diffusion language modeling from the view of diffusion process and language modeling, and outline five properties that separate diffusion mechanics from language-specific requirements. We first categorize existing approaches into continuous diffusion in embedding space and discrete diffusion over tokens. We then show that each satisfies only part of the five essential properties and therefore reflects a structural trade-off. Through analyses of recent large diffusion language models, we identify two central issues: (i) uniform corruption does not respect how information is distributed across positions, and (ii) token-wise marginal training cannot capture multi-token dependencies during parallel decoding. These observations motivate diffusion processes that align more closely with the structure of text, and encourage future work toward more coherent diffusion language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u6587\u672c\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7279\u6027\u7ed9\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u6269\u6563\u539f\u7406\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u4ece\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e94\u4e2a\u533a\u5206\u6269\u6563\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6269\u6563\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u4e24\u7c7b\u3002\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u6ee1\u8db3\u90e8\u5206\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6743\u8861\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\uff1a(i) \u5747\u5300\u6270\u52a8\u4e0d\u5c0a\u91cd\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff1b(ii) \u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6807\u8bb0\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u7531\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u6587\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u672c\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7279\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e94\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0e\u95ee\u9898\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u591a\u6807\u8bb0\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u6587\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u5951\u5408\u6587\u672c\u7279\u6027\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

However, recent studies show that CoT explanations often fail to reflect the model's actual reasoning process, as models may produce coherent yet misleading justifications or modify answers without acknowledging external cues. Such discrepancies undermine the reliability of CoT-based methods for safety supervision and alignment monitoring, as models can generate plausible but deceptive rationales for incorrect answers. To better understand this limitation, we evaluate two optimization methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), in their ability to improve CoT faithfulness. Our experiments show that GRPO achieves higher performance than DPO in larger models, with the Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct model attaining the best results across all evaluation metrics. Both approaches exhibit positive correlations between model size and performance, but GRPO shows greater potential for improving faithfulness metrics, albeit with less stable behavior at smaller scales. These results suggest that GRPO offers a promising direction for developing more transparent and trustworthy reasoning in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c3d\u7ba1CoT\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u771f\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u7b26\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08GRPO\uff09\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08DPO\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eGRPO\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u6f5c\u529b\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8f83\u5dee\u3002\u603b\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u8d8a\u5927\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8d8a\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14GRPO\u66f4\u5177\u53d1\u5c55\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u5e38\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u770b\u4f3c\u5408\u7406\u5b9e\u5219\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u63d0\u5347CoT\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08GRPO\uff09\u4e0e\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08DPO\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "GRPO\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eDPO\uff0cQwen2.5-14B-Instruct\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff1b\u4e24\u8005\u5747\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u8d8a\u5927\u6027\u80fd\u8d8a\u597d\uff0c\u4f46GRPO\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u5177\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "GRPO\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u9636\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Thus, relevancy maps are treated as \"abstract object\" representations. We use this framework for learning 3D localization and completion for the exclusive domain of hidden objects, defined as objects that cannot be directly identified by a VLM because they are at least partially occluded. This process of localizing hidden objects is a form of unstructured search that can be performed more efficiently using historical data of where an object is frequently placed. Our model can accurately identify the complete 3D location of a hidden object on the first try significantly faster than a naive random search. These extensions to semantic abstraction hope to provide household robots with the skills necessary to save time and effort when looking for lost objects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u75282D\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u201c\u62bd\u8c61\u7269\u4f53\u201d\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e3D\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u8865\u5168\u9690\u85cf\u7269\u4f53\u3002\u9690\u85cf\u7269\u4f53\u6307\u56e0\u90e8\u5206\u906e\u6321\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u88ab\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7269\u4f53\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u653e\u7f6e\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u7ed3\u6784\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5728\u9996\u6b21\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9690\u85cf\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u5b8c\u65743D\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u641c\u7d22\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5bb6\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u5bfb\u627e\u4e22\u5931\u7269\u54c1\u65f6\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u88ab\u906e\u6321\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u7269\u4f53\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u67e5\u627e\u4e22\u5931\u7269\u54c1\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u663e\u8457\u6027\u4e0e\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u641c\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u75282D VLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u62bd\u8c61\u7269\u4f53\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5c06\u9690\u85cf\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u65e0\u7ed3\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5386\u53f2\u653e\u7f6e\u6570\u636e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u52a0\u901f3D\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u9996\u6b21\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u9690\u85cf\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u5b8c\u65743D\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u8fdc\u8d85\u4f20\u7edf\u968f\u673a\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u663e\u8457\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\u89c6\u4e3a\u62bd\u8c61\u8868\u793a\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u5386\u53f2\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bf9\u9690\u85cf\u7269\u4f53\u76843D\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5bb6\u5ead\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u641c\u5bfb\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, current agent architectures are frequently constructed using imperative, ad hoc patterns. This results in brittle systems plagued by difficulties in state management, error handling, and concurrency. This paper introduces Monadic Context Engineering (MCE), a novel architectural paradigm leveraging the algebraic structures of Functors, Applicative Functors, and Monads to provide a formal foundation for agent design. MCE treats agent workflows as computational contexts where cross-cutting concerns, such as state propagation, short-circuiting error handling, and asynchronous execution, are managed intrinsically by the algebraic properties of the abstraction. We demonstrate how Monads enable robust sequential composition, how Applicatives provide a principled structure for parallel execution, and crucially, how Monad Transformers allow for the systematic composition of these capabilities. This layered approach enables developers to construct complex, resilient, and efficient AI agents from simple, independently verifiable components. We further extend this framework to describe Meta-Agents, which leverage MCE for generative orchestration, dynamically creating and managing sub-agent workflows through metaprogramming.

Existing static strategies, such as sparse sampling, frame compression, and clustering, are optimized for offline settings and often produce fragmented or over-compressed outputs when applied to continuous video streams. We present VideoScaffold, a dynamic representation framework designed for streaming video understanding. It adaptively adjusts event granularity according to video duration while preserving fine-grained visual semantics. VideoScaffold introduces two key components: Elastic-Scale Event Segmentation (EES), which performs prediction-guided segmentation to dynamically refine event boundaries, and Hierarchical Event Consolidation (HEC), which progressively aggregates semantically related segments into multi-level abstractions. Working in concert, EES and HEC enable VideoScaffold to transition smoothly from fine-grained frame understanding to abstract event reasoning as the video stream unfolds.

We introduce \\textbf{DarkPatterns-LLM}, a comprehensive benchmark dataset and diagnostic framework for fine-grained assessment of manipulative content in LLM outputs across seven harm categories: Legal/Power, Psychological, Emotional, Physical, Autonomy, Economic, and Societal Harm. Our framework implements a four-layer analytical pipeline comprising Multi-Granular Detection (MGD), Multi-Scale Intent Analysis (MSIAN), Threat Harmonization Protocol (THP), and Deep Contextual Risk Alignment (DCRA). The dataset contains 401 meticulously curated examples with instruction-response pairs and expert annotations. Through evaluation of state-of-the-art models including GPT-4, Claude 3.5, and LLaMA-3-70B, we observe significant performance disparities (65.2\\%--89.7\\%) and consistent weaknesses in detecting autonomy-undermining patterns.

We present a systematic study of Adaptive Prediction Sets (APS) applied to next-token prediction in transformer-based models with large vocabularies (greater than 250,000 tokens). Our central contribution is the identification of a coverage-efficiency tradeoff: while naive conformal prediction achieves valid coverage, it produces prediction sets of hundreds of tokens, rendering them uninformative. We propose Vocabulary-Aware Conformal Prediction (VACP), a framework that leverages semantic masking and temperature-adjusted scoring to reduce the effective prediction space while provably maintaining marginal coverage. Experiments on Gemma-2B using SQUAD and WikiText benchmarks demonstrate that VACP achieves 89.7 percent empirical coverage (90 percent target) while reducing the mean prediction set size from 847 tokens to 4.3 tokens -- a 197x improvement in efficiency.

However, their performance is frequently constrained by the overly simplistic front-end designs employed in models like ViTPose. This naive patchification mechanism struggles to effectively handle multi-scale variations and results in irreversible information loss during the initial feature extraction phase. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel KAN-enhanced FPN-Stem architecture. Through rigorous ablation studies, we first identified that the true bottleneck for performance improvement lies not in plug-and-play attention modules (e.g., CBAM), but in the post-fusion non-linear smoothing step within the FPN. Guided by this insight, our core innovation is to retain the classic \"upsample-and-add\" fusion stream of the FPN, but replace its terminal, standard linear 3x3 smoothing convolution with a powerful KAN-based convolutional layer. Leveraging its superior non-linear modeling capabilities, this KAN-based layer adaptively learns and rectifies the \"artifacts\" generated during the multi-scale fusion process. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset demonstrate that our KAN-FPN-Stem achieves a significant performance boost of up to +2.0 AP over the lightweight ViTPose-S baseline. This work not only delivers a plug-and-play, high-performance module but, more importantly, reveals that: the performance bottleneck in ViT front-end often lies not in 'feature refinement' (Attention), but in the quality of 'feature fusion' (Fusion). Furthermore, it provides an effective path to address this bottleneck through the introduction of the KAN operator.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faKAN-enhanced FPN-Stem\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528KAN-based\u5377\u79ef\u66ff\u4ee3FPN\u672b\u7aef\u7684\u7ebf\u60273x3\u5377\u79ef\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728COCO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4ViTPose-S\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad82.0 AP\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86ViT\u524d\u7aef\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u5728\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u800c\u975e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709ViT\u6a21\u578b\u5982ViTPose\u91c7\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684patchification\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u4e14\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u4f20\u7edfFPN\u540e\u878d\u5408\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5e73\u6ed1\u6b65\u9aa4\u6210\u4e3a\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u4fdd\u7559FPN\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u52a0\u6cd5\u878d\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u672b\u7aef\u6807\u51c6\u7ebf\u60273x3\u5377\u79ef\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u7684KAN-based\u5377\u79ef\u5c42\uff0c\u4ee5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fee\u590d\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "result": "\u5728COCO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u8f83\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7ViTPose-S\u57fa\u7ebf\u6700\u5927\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe+2.0 AP\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u63d2\u62d4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ViT\u524d\u7aef\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u8d28\u91cf\u800c\u975e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u5f15\u5165KAN\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bc6\u96c6\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing methods often neglect both projection-domain physics knowledge and patient-specific meta-information, which are critical for functional-semantic correlation mining. In this study, we introduce a meta-information guided cross-domain synergistic diffusion model (MiG-DM) that integrates comprehensive cross-modal priors to generate high-quality PET images. Specifically, a meta-information encoding module transforms clinical parameters into semantic prompts by considering patient characteristics, dose-related information, and semi-quantitative parameters, enabling cross-modal alignment between textual meta-information and image reconstruction. Additionally, the cross-domain architecture combines projection-domain and image-domain processing. In the projection domain, a specialized sinogram adapter captures global physical structures through convolution operations equivalent to global image-domain filtering.

However, current foundation models ignore three other important components of state-of-the-art predictive coding models: tight integration of actions with generative models, hierarchical compositional structure, and episodic memory. We propose that to achieve safe, interpretable, energy-efficient, and human-like AI, foundation models should integrate actions, at multiple scales of abstraction, with a compositional generative architecture and episodic memory. We present recent evidence from neuroscience and cognitive science on the importance of each of these components. We describe how the addition of these missing components to foundation models could help address some of their current deficiencies: hallucinations and superficial understanding of concepts due to lack of grounding, a missing sense of agency/responsibility due to lack of control, threats to safety and trustworthiness due to lack of interpretability, and energy inefficiency. We compare our proposal to current trends, such as adding chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to foundation models, and discuss new ways of augmenting these models with brain-inspired components. We conclude by arguing that a rekindling of the historically fruitful exchange of ideas between brain science and AI will help pave the way towards safe and interpretable human-centered AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u867d\u7136\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bcd\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u5148\u8fdb\u9884\u6d4b\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u8981\u7d20\uff1a\u884c\u52a8\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u6574\u5408\u3001\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u53ca\u60c5\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u8282\u80fd\u4e14\u7c7b\u4eba\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u5e94\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u878d\u5165\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u5f15\u7528\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6301\u8fd9\u4e00\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6539\u8fdb\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5982\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u6982\u5ff5\u7406\u89e3\u80a4\u6d45\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\u53ca\u80fd\u6548\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u8d8b\u52bf\uff08\u5982\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u5f3a\u8111\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u4ea4\u6d41\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u672c\u7684AI\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bcd\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u60c5\u5883\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u4f53\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u548c\u8d23\u4efb\u610f\u8bc6\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u591a\u6765\u81ea\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u987e\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7f16\u7801\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff08\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u52a8\u4f5c\u6574\u5408\u3001\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u60c5\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5143\u7d20\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982CoT\u548cRAG\uff09\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u8111\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u589e\u5f3a\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u4f5c\u6574\u5408\u3001\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u60c5\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u540e\uff0c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u671b\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u8d23\u4efb\u611f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u4fe1\u3001\u7c7b\u4eba\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u4e0d\u5e94\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u800c\u5e94\u91cd\u65b0\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8111\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u534f\u540c\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u751f\u7269\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8fc8\u5411\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u672c\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

This raises the need for compact yet capable VLMs that can efficiently learn from powerful large teachers. However, distilling knowledge from a large teacher to a small student remains challenging due to their large size gap: the student often fails to reproduce the teacher's complex, high-dimensional representations, leading to unstable learning and degraded performance. To address this, we propose Masters (Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student), a mask-progressive reinforcement learning (RL) distillation framework. Masters first masks non-dominant weights of the teacher to reduce unnecessary complexity, then progressively restores the teacher by gradually increasing its capacity during training. This strategy allows the student to learn richer representations from the teacher in a smooth and stable manner. To further refine knowledge transfer, Masters integrates an offline RL stage with two complementary rewards: an accuracy reward that measures the correctness of the generated responses, and a distillation reward that quantifies the ease of transferring responses from teacher to student. Unlike online think-answer RL paradigms that are computationally expensive and generate lengthy responses, our offline RL leverages pre-generated responses from masked teachers. These provide rich yet efficient guidance, enabling students to achieve strong performance without requiring the think-answer process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMasters\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4f20\u9012\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6b65\u6062\u590d\u88ab\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4f7f\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u5e73\u6ed1\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u84b8\u998f\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u751f\u6210\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u54cd\u5e94\u5197\u957f\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c0f\u578b\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u4f53\u79ef\u5e9e\u5927\u96be\u4ee5\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8e\u79fb\u52a8\u6216\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u3002\u5982\u4f55\u8ba9\u5c0f\u578b\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u4ece\u5927\u578b\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u5e08\u751f\u95f4\u89c4\u6a21\u5dee\u5f02\u8fc7\u5927\uff0c\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u751f\u65e0\u6cd5\u590d\u73b0\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u590d\u6742\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMasters\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u63a9\u7801\u4e0e\u6743\u91cd\u6062\u590d\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5148\u5bf9\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u975e\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6743\u91cd\u8fdb\u884c\u63a9\u7801\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u518d\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9010\u6b65\u6062\u590d\u5176\u5bb9\u91cf\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u84b8\u998f\u5956\u52b1\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u54cd\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5728\u7ebf\u601d\u8003-\u56de\u7b54\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMasters\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u578b\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u90e8\u5206\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Masters\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u63a9\u7801\u4e0e\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8de8\u89c4\u6a21\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4f46\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We introduce a human-validated framework to evaluate whether model-generated reasoning traces logically support their conclusions across languages. Analyzing 65k reasoning traces from GlobalMMLU questions across 6 languages and 6 frontier models, we uncover a critical blind spot: while models achieve high task accuracy, their reasoning can fail to support their conclusions. Reasoning traces in non-Latin scripts show at least twice as much misalignment between their reasoning and conclusions than those in Latin scripts. We develop an error taxonomy through human annotation to characterize these failures, finding they stem primarily from evidential errors (unsupported claims, ambiguous facts) followed by illogical reasoning steps.

Once a model reaches high accuracy, its explanation is often assumed to be correct and trustworthy. However, this assumption raises an overlooked question: when two models achieve high accuracy, do they rely on the same internal logic, or do they reach the same outcome via different -- and potentially competing -- mechanisms? We introduce EvoXplain, a diagnostic framework that measures the stability of model explanations across repeated training. Rather than analysing a single trained model, EvoXplain treats explanations as samples drawn from the stochastic optimisation process itself -- without aggregating predictions or constructing ensembles -- and examines whether these samples form a single coherent explanation or separate into multiple, distinct explanatory modes. We evaluate EvoXplain on the Breast Cancer and COMPAS datasets using two widely deployed model classes: Logistic Regression and Random Forests. Although all models achieve high predictive accuracy, their explanations frequently exhibit clear multimodality. Even models commonly assumed to be stable, such as Logistic Regression, can produce multiple well-separated explanatory basins under repeated training on the same data split. These differences are not explained by hyperparameter variation or simple performance trade-offs. EvoXplain does not attempt to select a 'correct' explanation. Instead, it makes explanatory instability visible and quantifiable, revealing when single-instance or averaged explanations obscure the existence of multiple underlying mechanisms. More broadly, EvoXplain reframes interpretability as a property of a model class under repeated instantiation, rather than of any single trained model.", "AI": {"tldr": "EvoXplain \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u5728\u91cd\u590d\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5b83\u5c06\u89e3\u91ca\u89c6\u4e3a\u6765\u81ea\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63ed\u793a\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u548cCOMPAS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u51c6\u786e\u4f46\u89e3\u91ca\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u591a\u6a21\u6027\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u4f20\u7edf\u89e3\u91ca\u53ef\u80fd\u63a9\u76d6\u4e86\u591a\u91cd\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e38\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u6807\u5fd7\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5f53\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u80fd\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u903b\u8f91\u662f\u5426\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u56e0\u5355\u4e00\u6216\u5e73\u5747\u89e3\u91ca\u800c\u8bef\u5224\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "EvoXplain \u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u89c6\u4e3a\u4ece\u91cd\u590d\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u91ca\u5206\u5e03\u662f\u5426\u5f62\u6210\u5355\u4e00\u8fde\u8d2f\u6a21\u5f0f\u6216\u591a\u4e2a\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u96c6\u6210\u6216\u805a\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u8003\u5bdf\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u548cCOMPAS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u591a\u6a21\u6027\uff1b\u5373\u4fbf\u662f\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e5f\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u4ea7\u751f\u591a\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u57fa\u5e95\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u5f02\u65e0\u6cd5\u7531\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u6216\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u5728\u591a\u6b21\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002EvoXplain \u4f7f\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u9192\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8b66\u60d5\u5355\u4e00\u89e3\u91ca\u53ef\u80fd\u63a9\u76d6\u771f\u5b9e\u590d\u6742\u673a\u5236\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

However, responses to socially sensitive questions frequently exhibit Social Desirability Bias (SDB), diverging from real human data toward socially acceptable answers. Existing studies on social desirability bias in LLM-based sampling remain limited. In this work, we investigate whether minimal, psychologically grounded prompt wording can mitigate this bias and improve alignment between silicon and human samples. We conducted a study using data from the American National Election Study (ANES) on three LLMs from two model families: the open-source Llama-3.1 series and GPT-4.1-mini. We first replicate a baseline silicon sampling study, confirming the persistent Social Desirability Bias. We then test four prompt-based mitigation methods: \\emph{reformulated} (neutral, third-person phrasing), \\emph{reverse-coded} (semantic inversion), and two meta-instructions, \\emph{priming} and \\emph{preamble}, respectively encouraging analytics and sincerity. Alignment with ANES is evaluated using Jensen-Shannon Divergence with bootstrap confidence intervals. Our results demonstrate that reformulated prompts most effectively improve alignment by reducing distribution concentration on socially acceptable answers and achieving distributions closer to ANES. Reverse-coding produced mixed results across eligible items, while the Priming and Preamble encouraged response uniformity and showed no systematic benefit for bias mitigation. Our findings validate the efficacy of prompt-based framing controls in mitigating inherent Social Desirability Bias in LLMs, providing a practical path toward more representative silicon samples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7fa4\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u671f\u671b\u504f\u5dee\uff08SDB\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u7845\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f8e\u56fd\u5168\u56fd\u9009\u4e3e\u7814\u7a76\uff08ANES\uff09\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86Llama-3.1\u7cfb\u5217\u4e0eGPT-4.1-mini\u5728\u56db\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1a\u91cd\u8ff0\u5f0f\uff08\u4e2d\u6027\u7b2c\u4e09\u4eba\u79f0\uff09\u3001\u53cd\u5411\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u548c\u524d\u8a00\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u91cd\u8ff0\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u6700\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u597d\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5206\u5e03\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u53cd\u5411\u7f16\u7801\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\uff1b\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0e\u524d\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u867d\u589e\u52a0\u54cd\u5e94\u5747\u5300\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6539\u5584\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u6846\u67b6\u63a7\u5236\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3LLM\u7684SDB\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5177\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u7845\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7fa4\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u671f\u671b\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u504f\u5411\u793e\u4f1a\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u504f\u79bb\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7845\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f8e\u56fd\u5168\u56fd\u9009\u4e3e\u7814\u7a76\uff08ANES\uff09\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Llama-3.1\u7cfb\u5217\u548cGPT-4.1-mini\u8fdb\u884c\u7845\u91c7\u6837\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002\u9996\u5148\u590d\u73b0\u57fa\u7ebf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u793e\u4f1a\u671f\u671b\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56db\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u91cd\u8ff0\u5f0f\uff08\u4e2d\u6027\u7b2c\u4e09\u4eba\u79f0\uff09\u3001\u53cd\u5411\u7f16\u7801\uff08\u8bed\u4e49\u53cd\u8f6c\uff09\u3001\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\uff08\u5f3a\u8c03\u5206\u6790\u6027\uff09\u548c\u524d\u8a00\u5f0f\uff08\u5f3a\u8c03\u771f\u8bda\u6027\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7Jensen-Shannon\u6563\u5ea6\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u52a9\u6cd5\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u7845\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u91cd\u8ff0\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u7845\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u96c6\u4e2d\u8d8b\u52bf\uff1b\u53cd\u5411\u7f16\u7801\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u9898\u9879\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u4e0e\u524d\u8a00\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u867d\u63d0\u9ad8\u54cd\u5e94\u5747\u5300\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u7cfb\u7edf\u51cf\u5c11\u793e\u4f1a\u671f\u671b\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u91cd\u8ff0\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u671f\u671b\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7845\u6837\u672c\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u865a\u62df\u62bd\u6837\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u624b\u6bb5\u3002"}}

However, traditional red-green-blue (RGB) detection pipelines struggle in low-light environments, and thermal-based systems lack color and texture information. To overcome these limitations, we present an adaptive framework that fuses RGB and long-wave infrared (LWIR) video streams at multiple fusion ratios and dynamically selects the optimal detection model for each illumination condition. We trained 33 You Only Look Once (YOLO) models on over 22,000 annotated images spanning three light levels: no-light (<10 lux), dim-light (10-1000 lux), and full-light (>1000 lux). To integrate both modalities, fusion was performed by blending aligned RGB and LWIR frames at eleven ratios, from full RGB (100/0) to full LWIR (0/100) in 10% increments. Evaluation showed that the best full-light model (80/20 RGB-LWIR) and dim-light model (90/10 fusion) achieved 92.8% and 92.0% mean confidence; both significantly outperformed the YOLOv5 nano (YOLOv5n) and YOLOv11 nano (YOLOv11n) baselines. Under no-light conditions, the top 40/60 fusion reached 71.0%, exceeding baselines though not statistically significant.

Despite ongoing efforts to understand the causes of negative pregnancy outcomes like miscarriage, stillbirths, birth defects, and premature birth, there is still a need for more comprehensive research and strategies for intervention. This paper introduces a novel approach that uses publicly available social media data, especially from platforms like Twitter, to enhance current datasets for studying negative pregnancy outcomes through observational research. The inherent challenges in utilizing social media data, including imbalance, noise, and lack of structure, necessitate robust preprocessing techniques and data augmentation strategies. By constructing a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline, we aim to automatically identify women sharing their pregnancy experiences, categorizing them based on reported outcomes. Women reporting full gestation and normal birth weight will be classified as positive cases, while those reporting negative pregnancy outcomes will be identified as negative cases. Furthermore, this study offers potential applications in assessing the causal impact of specific interventions, treatments, or prenatal exposures on maternal and fetal health outcomes.

This reflects a broader semantic gap between human perception and current generative models. We investigate whether geometric understanding can be introduced without specialized training by using lightweight, off-the-shelf discriminators as external guidance signals. We propose a Human Perception Embedding (HPE) teacher trained on the THINGS triplet dataset, which captures human sensitivity to object shape. By injecting gradients from this teacher into the latent diffusion process, we show that geometry and style can be separated in a controllable manner. We evaluate this approach across three architectures: Stable Diffusion v1.5 with a U-Net backbone, the flow-matching model SiT-XL/2, and the diffusion transformer PixArt-\u03a3. Our experiments reveal that flow models tend to drift back toward their default trajectories without continuous guidance, and we demonstrate zero-shot transfer of complex three-dimensional shapes, such as an Eames chair, onto conflicting materials such as pink metal. This guided generation improves semantic alignment by about 80 percent compared to unguided baselines. Overall, our results show that small teacher models can reliably guide large generative systems, enabling stronger geometric control and broadening the creative range of text-to-image synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e13\u95e8\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u73b0\u6210\u7684\u5224\u522b\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5916\u90e8\u6307\u5bfc\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u7406\u89e3\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTHINGS\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u5d4c\u5165\uff08HPE\uff09\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u7269\u4f53\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8be5\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6ce8\u5165\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u5206\u79bb\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8986\u76d6\u4e09\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\uff1aStable Diffusion v1.5\u3001SiT-XL/2\u548cPixArt-\u03a3\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6301\u7eed\u5f15\u5bfc\u65f6\u6613\u504f\u79bb\u9ed8\u8ba4\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u800c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u4e09\u7ef4\u5f62\u72b6\uff08\u5982Eames\u6905\uff09\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u6750\u8d28\uff08\u5982\u7c89\u7ea2\u8272\u91d1\u5c5e\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u7ea680%\u3002\u603b\u4f53\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c0f\u578b\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5f15\u5bfc\u5927\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u51e0\u4f55\u63a7\u5236\u529b\u5e76\u62d3\u5c55\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u7684\u521b\u4f5c\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\u5316\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u9762\u5916\u89c2\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9075\u5faa\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u98ce\u683c\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u51fa\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u51e0\u4f55\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u5d4c\u5165\uff08HPE\uff09\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eTHINGS\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u7269\u4f53\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8be5\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6ce8\u5165\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5728\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u51e0\u4f55\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u4e09\u7ef4\u5f62\u72b6\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u6750\u8d28\u4e0a\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u672a\u5f15\u5bfc\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u7ea680%\uff1b\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6301\u7eed\u5f15\u5bfc\u65f6\u6613\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u9700\u6301\u7eed\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c0f\u578b\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u5f15\u5bfc\u5927\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u51e0\u4f55\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u7684\u521b\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing methods suffer from limited generalization capability: unimodal approaches are constrained by data sparsity and inherent biases, while multi-modal methods struggle to effectively capture mobility dynamics caused by the semantic gap between static multi-modal representation and spatial-temporal dynamics. Therefore, we leverage multi-modal spatial-temporal knowledge to characterize mobility dynamics for the location recommendation task, dubbed as \\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{M}odal \\textbf{Mob}ility (\\textbf{M}$^3$\\textbf{ob}). First, we construct a unified spatial-temporal relational graph (STRG) for multi-modal representation, by leveraging the functional semantics and spatial-temporal knowledge captured by the large language models (LLMs)-enhanced spatial-temporal knowledge graph (STKG). Second, we design a gating mechanism to fuse spatial-temporal graph representations of different modalities, and propose an STKG-guided cross-modal alignment to inject spatial-temporal dynamic knowledge into the static image modality. Extensive experiments on six public datasets show that our proposed method not only achieves consistent improvements in normal scenarios but also exhibits significant generalization ability in abnormal scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aM$^3$ob\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\uff08STRG\uff09\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff08STKG\uff09\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165STKG\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ee5\u6ce8\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u7a7a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f4d\u7f6e\u63a8\u8350\u5728\u6b63\u5e38\u4e0e\u5f02\u5e38\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u56fa\u6709\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u5219\u96be\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u9759\u6001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff08STKG\uff09\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u65f6\u7a7a\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\uff08STRG\uff09\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u7a7a\u56fe\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faSTKG\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u7a7a\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u9759\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6b63\u5e38\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4e5f\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "M$^3$ob\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u7a7a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u6001\u6355\u6349\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u63a8\u8350\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Screening high-risk individuals with annual low-dose CT (LDCT) can support earlier detection and reduce deaths, but widespread implementation may strain the already limited radiology workforce. AI models have shown potential in estimating lung cancer risk from LDCT scans. However, high-risk populations for lung cancer are diverse, and these models' performance across demographic groups remains an open question. In this study, we drew on the considerations on confounding factors and ethically significant biases outlined in the JustEFAB framework to evaluate potential performance disparities and fairness in two deep learning risk estimation models for lung cancer screening: the Sybil lung cancer risk model and the Venkadesh21 nodule risk estimator. We also examined disparities in the PanCan2b logistic regression model recommended in the British Thoracic Society nodule management guideline. Both deep learning models were trained on data from the US-based National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), and assessed on a held-out NLST validation set. We evaluated AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity across demographic subgroups, and explored potential confounding from clinical risk factors. We observed a statistically significant AUROC difference in Sybil's performance between women (0.88, 95% CI: 0.86, 0.90) and men (0.81, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.84, p < .001). At 90% specificity, Venkadesh21 showed lower sensitivity for Black (0.39, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.59) than White participants (0.69, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.73). These differences were not explained by available clinical confounders and thus may be classified as unfair biases according to JustEFAB. Our findings highlight the importance of improving and monitoring model performance across underrepresented subgroups, and further research on algorithmic fairness, in lung cancer screening.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u80ba\u764c\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff08Sybil\u548cVenkadesh21\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u7684PanCan2b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u53e3\u5b66\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5973\u6027\u4e0e\u7537\u6027\u3001\u9ed1\u4eba\u4e0e\u767d\u4eba\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\u65e0\u6cd5\u7531\u4e34\u5e8a\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5c5e\u4e8e\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u52a0\u5f3a\u5bf9\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u76d1\u63a7\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u80ba\u764c\u662f\u5168\u7403\u6210\u4eba\u764c\u75c7\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4f4e\u5242\u91cfCT\u7b5b\u67e5\u53ef\u65e9\u671f\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u52a0\u5267\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u8d44\u6e90\u538b\u529b\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u7fa4\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u662f\u5426\u516c\u5e73\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4eba\u7fa4\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u53e3\u5b66\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eJustEFAB\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08Sybil\u548cVenkadesh21\uff09\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u63a8\u8350\u7528\u4e8e\u82f1\u56fd\u80f8\u79d1\u5b66\u4f1a\u7ed3\u8282\u7ba1\u7406\u6307\u5357\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff08PanCan2b\uff09\u5728\u56fd\u5bb6\u80ba\u7b5b\u67e5\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff08NLST\uff09\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u5404\u4eba\u53e3\u4e9a\u7ec4\u7684AUROC\u3001\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e34\u5e8a\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "Sybil\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5973\u6027\uff08AUROC 0.88\uff09\u4e0e\u7537\u6027\uff08AUROC 0.81\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff08p < .001\uff09\uff1bVenkadesh21\u5728\u9ed1\u4eba\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u4e2d\uff08\u654f\u611f\u60270.39\uff09\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u767d\u4eba\uff08\u654f\u611f\u60270.69\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\u65e0\u6cd5\u7531\u73b0\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u56e0\u7d20\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u80ba\u764c\u7b5b\u67e5AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u53e3\u5b66\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5fc5\u987b\u6539\u8fdb\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u7b97\u6cd5\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u516c\u5e73\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Diffusion Language Models (DLLMs) offer parallel decoding by recovering multiple masked tokens per step; however, in practice they often fail to translate this parallelism into deployment speed gains over optimized AR engines (e.g., vLLM). A key reason is that many DLLMs rely on bidirectional attention, which breaks standard prefix KV caching and forces repeated contextualization, undermining efficiency. We propose WeDLM, a diffusion decoding framework built entirely on standard causal attention to make parallel generation prefix-cache friendly. The core idea is to let each masked position condition on all currently observed tokens while keeping a strict causal mask, achieved by Topological Reordering that moves observed tokens to the physical prefix while preserving their logical positions. Building on this property, we introduce a streaming decoding procedure that continuously commits confident tokens into a growing left-to-right prefix and maintains a fixed parallel workload, avoiding the stop-and-wait behavior common in block diffusion methods. Experiments show that WeDLM preserves the quality of strong AR backbones while delivering substantial speedups, approaching 3x on challenging reasoning benchmarks and up to 10x in low-entropy generation regimes; critically, our comparisons are against AR baselines served by vLLM under matched deployment settings, demonstrating that diffusion-style decoding can outperform an optimized AR engine in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "WeDLM\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u56e0\u679c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u4f7f\u88ab\u63a9\u7801\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u56e0\u679c\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6240\u6709\u5df2\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u524d\u7f00\u7f13\u5b58\u53cb\u597d\u6027\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u6d41\u5f0f\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u5c06\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u52a0\u5165\u5de6\u5230\u53f3\u524d\u7f00\uff0c\u7ef4\u6301\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e76\u884c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u5757\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u505c\u7b49\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cWeDLM\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3aAR\u57fa\u7ebf\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63a5\u8fd13\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4f4e\u71b5\u751f\u6210\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u53ef\u8fbe10\u500d\uff1b\u4e14\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e3a\u4f7f\u7528vLLM\u4f18\u5316\u7684AR\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u90e8\u7f72\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u53ef\u5b9e\u9645\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684AR\u5f15\u64ce\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\uff08AR\uff09\u751f\u6210\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9010\u6807\u8bb0\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5e76\u884c\uff1b\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLLMs\uff09\u80fd\u5e76\u884c\u6062\u590d\u591a\u4e2a\u63a9\u7801\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u6807\u51c6\u524d\u7f00\u952e\u503c\uff08KV\uff09\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u590d\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u672a\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u53c8\u517c\u5bb9\u524d\u7f00\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faWeDLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u62d3\u6251\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\uff08Topological Reordering\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u5df2\u89c2\u5bdf\u6807\u8bb0\u7269\u7406\u79fb\u81f3\u524d\u7f00\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u903b\u8f91\u4e0a\u4fdd\u7559\u5176\u539f\u59cb\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u56e0\u679c\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u8ba9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63a9\u7801\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u5df2\u77e5\u6807\u8bb0\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d41\u5f0f\u89e3\u7801\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4ea4\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6807\u8bb0\u8fdb\u5165\u524d\u7f00\uff0c\u7ef4\u6301\u6052\u5b9a\u5e76\u884c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u505c\u7b49\u3002", "result": "WeDLM\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u5f3a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\uff1a\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63a5\u8fd13\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u71b5\u751f\u6210\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe10\u500d\u3002\u5173\u952e\u662f\u5728\u4e0evLLM\u4f18\u5316\u7684AR\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u540c\u90e8\u7f72\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u53ef\u5b9e\u9645\u8d85\u8d8a\u5148\u8fdb\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5f15\u64ce\u3002", "conclusion": "WeDLM\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u62d3\u6251\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u9ad8\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bc1\u660e\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u53ef\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Current benchmarks, typically based on medical licensing exams or curated vignettes, fail to capture the integrated, multimodal reasoning essential for real-world patient care. Methods: We developed the Bones and Joints (B&J) Benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation framework comprising 1,245 questions derived from real-world patient cases in orthopedics and sports medicine. This benchmark assesses models across 7 tasks that mirror the clinical reasoning pathway, including knowledge recall, text and image interpretation, diagnosis generation, treatment planning, and rationale provision. We evaluated eleven vision-language models (VLMs) and six large language models (LLMs), comparing their performance against expert-derived ground truth. Results: Our results demonstrate a pronounced performance gap between task types. While state-of-the-art models achieved high accuracy, exceeding 90%, on structured multiple-choice questions, their performance markedly declined on open-ended tasks requiring multimodal integration, with accuracy scarcely reaching 60%. VLMs demonstrated substantial limitations in interpreting medical images and frequently exhibited severe text-driven hallucinations, often ignoring contradictory visual evidence. Notably, models specifically fine-tuned for medical applications showed no consistent advantage over general-purpose counterparts. Conclusions: Current artificial intelligence models are not yet clinically competent for complex, multimodal reasoning. Their safe deployment should currently be limited to supportive, text-based roles.

This study investigates whether a similar intervention, i.e. allowing LLMs to review each other's forecasts before updating, can improve accuracy in large language models (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini Pro 2.5). Using 202 resolved binary questions from the Metaculus Q2 2025 AI Forecasting Tournament, accuracy was assessed across four scenarios: (1) diverse models with distributed information, (2) diverse models with shared information, (3) homogeneous models with distributed information, and (4) homogeneous models with shared information. Results show that the intervention significantly improves accuracy in scenario (2), reducing Log Loss by 0.020 or about 4 percent in relative terms (p = 0.017). However, when homogeneous groups (three instances of the same model) engaged in the same process, no benefit was observed. Unexpectedly, providing LLMs with additional contextual information did not improve forecast accuracy, limiting our ability to study information pooling as a mechanism.

However, existing techniques, such as verbalized confidence and multi-generation methods, are often either poorly calibrated or computationally expensive. We introduce linear probes trained with a Brier score-based loss to provide calibrated uncertainty estimates from reasoning judges' hidden states, requiring no additional model training. We evaluate our approach on both objective tasks (reasoning, mathematics, factuality, coding) and subjective human preference judgments. Our results demonstrate that probes achieve superior calibration compared to existing methods with $\\approx10$x computational savings, generalize robustly to unseen evaluation domains, and deliver higher accuracy on high-confidence predictions. However, probes produce conservative estimates that underperform on easier datasets but may benefit safety-critical deployments prioritizing low false-positive rates. Overall, our work demonstrates that interpretability-based uncertainty estimation provides a practical and scalable plug-and-play solution for LLM judges in production.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eBrier\u635f\u5931\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u4ece\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6cd5\u5b98\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u6821\u51c6\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5ba2\u89c2\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u3001\u7f16\u7801\uff09\u548c\u4e3b\u89c2\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5224\u65ad\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea610\u500d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002\u4f46\u63a2\u9488\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5b88\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u4f4e\u5047\u9633\u6027\u7387\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u3002\u6574\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6cd5\u5b98\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u63d2\u62d4\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5224\u5b98\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u53e3\u5934\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3001\u591a\u751f\u6210\u6cd5\uff09\u8981\u4e48\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5de5\u4e1a\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6821\u51c6\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eBrier\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u4ece\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u5224\u5b98\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u63a2\u9488\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea610\u500d\uff1b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff1b\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff1b\u4f46\u5bf9\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5b88\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5f3a\u8c03\u4f4e\u5047\u9633\u6027\u7387\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5224\u5b98\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u63d2\u62d4\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Existing scalar metrics suffer from limited interpretability, inadequate uncertainty quantification, and computational inefficiency in multi-system comparisons, hindering responsible deployment of RAG technologies. We introduce DICE (Discrete Interpretable Comparative Evaluation), a two-stage, evidence-coupled framework that advances explainability and robustness in RAG evaluation. DICE combines deep analytical reasoning with probabilistic $\\{A, B, Tie\\}$ scoring to produce transparent, confidence-aware judgments that support accountable system improvement through interpretable reasoning traces, enabling systematic error diagnosis and actionable insights. To address efficiency challenges at scale, DICE employs a Swiss-system tournament that reduces computational complexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N \\log N)$, achieving a 42.9% reduction in our eight-system evaluation while preserving ranking fidelity. Validation on a curated Chinese financial QA dataset demonstrates that DICE achieves 85.7% agreement with human experts, substantially outperforming existing LLM-based metrics such as RAGAS.

However, low-resource languages such as Urdu have received limited attention in this domain. An obvious approach is to utilize a multilingual pretrained language model and fine-tune it for a downstream classification task, such as misinformation detection. However, these models struggle with domain-specific terms, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we investigate the effectiveness of domain adaptation before fine-tuning for fake news classification in Urdu, employing a staged training approach to optimize model generalization. We evaluate two widely used multilingual models, XLM-RoBERTa and mBERT, and apply domain-adaptive pretraining using a publicly available Urdu news corpus. Experiments on four publicly available Urdu fake news datasets show that domain-adapted XLM-R consistently outperforms its vanilla counterpart, while domain-adapted mBERT exhibits mixed results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e4c\u5c14\u90fd\u8bed\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u865a\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u4e4c\u5c14\u90fd\u8bed\u65b0\u95fb\u8bed\u6599\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u518d\u5bf9XLM-RoBERTa\u548cmBERT\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684XLM-R\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800cmBERT\u5219\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5982\u4e4c\u5c14\u90fd\u8bed\u5728\u865a\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u9886\u57df\u5173\u6ce8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u7528\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u672f\u8bed\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u4e4c\u5c14\u90fd\u8bed\u65b0\u95fb\u8bed\u6599\u4e0a\u5bf9XLM-RoBERTa\u548cmBERT\u8fdb\u884c\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u5728\u865a\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684XLM-R\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e4c\u5c14\u90fd\u8bed\u865a\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684mBERT\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e4c\u5c14\u90fd\u8bed\u7684\u865a\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9XLM-RoBERTa\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

The framework identifies reflection as the key mechanism that enables agents to adapt through interaction without back propagation or model fine tuning, thereby relaxing the conventional separation between training and deployment.To formalise this process, we introduce the Stateful Reflective Decision Process, which models reflective learning as a two stage read write interaction with episodic memory. Writing stores interaction outcomes and corresponds to policy evaluation, while reading retrieves relevant past cases and corresponds to policy improvement. We show that this process induces an equivalent Markov decision process over augmented state memory representations, allowing the use of classical tools from dynamic programming and reinforcement learning. We further instantiate the framework using entropy regularised policy iteration and establish convergence guarantees. As episodic memory grows and achieves sufficient coverage of the state space, the resulting policy converges to the optimal solution.

However, traditional methods overlook the role of temporal semantic exploration in HMS. This paper explores the use of temporal vision semantics (TVS) derived from human motion sequences, leveraging the image-to-text capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to enhance subspace clustering performance. The core idea is to extract textual motion information from consecutive frames via LLM and incorporate this learned information into the subspace clustering framework. The primary challenge lies in learning TVS from human motion sequences using LLM and integrating this information into subspace clustering. To address this, we determine whether consecutive frames depict the same motion by querying the LLM and subsequently learn temporal neighboring information based on its response. We then develop a TVS-integrated subspace clustering approach, incorporating subspace embedding with a temporal regularizer that induces each frame to share similar subspace embeddings with its temporal neighbors. Additionally, segmentation is performed based on subspace embedding with a temporal constraint that induces the grouping of each frame with its temporal neighbors. We also introduce a feedback-enabled framework that continuously optimizes subspace embedding based on the segmentation output. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on four benchmark human motion datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\uff08TVS\uff09\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u4eba\u4f53\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4ece\u8fde\u7eed\u5e27\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6587\u672c\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u878d\u5165\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u5224\u65ad\u76f8\u90bb\u5e27\u662f\u5426\u8868\u793a\u76f8\u540c\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u5e8f\u90bb\u63a5\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5e26\u65f6\u5e8f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5e27\u95f4\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cd\u9988\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u679c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u793a\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u4eba\u4f53\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u52a8\u4f5c\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u53d6\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u878d\u5165\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u7c7b\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5206\u6790\u8fde\u7eed\u5e27\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u6587\u672c\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\uff08TVS\uff09\uff1b2. \u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u8f93\u51fa\u5224\u65ad\u76f8\u90bb\u5e27\u662f\u5426\u5c5e\u4e8e\u540c\u4e00\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u65f6\u5e8f\u90bb\u63a5\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b3. \u6784\u5efa\u5e26\u65f6\u5e8f\u6b63\u5219\u9879\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u76f8\u90bb\u5e27\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff1b4. \u5728\u805a\u7c7b\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u52a8\u4f5c\u7247\u6bb5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u8fde\u8d2f\uff1b5. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u679c\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5982CMU Mocap\u3001KIT Motion, etc.\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728mAP\u3001F1-score\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u6d41\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u878d\u5165\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u4eba\u4f53\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5272\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u52a8\u4f5c\u8fb9\u754c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u7247\u6bb5\u5206\u7ec4\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u53cd\u9988\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We propose a Segmented Allocation with Momentum-Adjusted Utility for Multi-agent Portfolio Management via Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (SAMP-HDRL). The framework first applies dynamic asset grouping to partition the market into high-quality and ordinary subsets. An upper-level agent extracts global market signals, while lower-level agents perform intra-group allocation under mask constraints. A utility-based capital allocation mechanism integrates risky and risk-free assets, ensuring coherent coordination between global and local decisions. backtests across three market regimes (2019--2021) demonstrate that SAMP-HDRL consistently outperforms nine traditional baselines and nine DRL benchmarks under volatile and oscillating conditions. Compared with the strongest baseline, our method achieves at least 5\\% higher Return, 5\\% higher Sharpe ratio, 5\\% higher Sortino ratio, and 2\\% higher Omega ratio, with substantially larger gains observed in turbulent markets. Ablation studies confirm that upper--lower coordination, dynamic clustering, and capital allocation are indispensable to robustness. SHAP-based interpretability further reveals a complementary ``diversified + concentrated'' mechanism across agents, providing transparent insights into decision-making. Overall, SAMP-HDRL embeds structural market constraints directly into the DRL pipeline, offering improved adaptability, robustness, and interpretability in complex financial environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "SAMP-HDRL \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5c42\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8d44\u4ea7\u5206\u7ec4\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u5c42\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6548\u7528\u7684\u8d44\u672c\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u5e02\u573a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u53caDRL\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u52a8\u8361\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u2018\u5206\u6563+\u96c6\u4e2d\u2019\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u51b3\u7b56\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u5236\u5ea6\u8f6c\u6362\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u653f\u7b56\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u517c\u5177\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSAMP-HDRL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u52a8\u6001\u8d44\u4ea7\u5206\u7ec4\uff08\u9ad8\u8d28/\u666e\u901a\u8d44\u4ea7\uff09\u3001\u4e0a\u5c42\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u53d6\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u4e0b\u5c42\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u63a9\u7801\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec4\u5185\u914d\u7f6e\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6548\u7528\u7684\u8d44\u672c\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u534f\u8c03\u5168\u5c40\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165SHAP\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u56de\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cSAMP-HDRL\u57282019\u20132021\u5e74\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e02\u573a\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a9\u79cd\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c9\u79cdDRL\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b\u76f8\u8f83\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u81f3\u5c11\u63d0\u53475%\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u7387\u3001\u590f\u666e\u6bd4\u7387\u3001\u7d22\u63d0\u8bfa\u6bd4\u7387\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca2%\u7684\u6b27\u7c73\u8304\u6bd4\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6ce2\u52a8\u5267\u70c8\u65f6\u671f\u4f18\u52bf\u66f4\u660e\u663e\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u5c42\u534f\u540c\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u805a\u7c7b\u4e0e\u8d44\u672c\u5206\u914d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "SAMP-HDRL\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5e02\u573a\u7ea6\u675f\u5d4c\u5165DRL\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u91d1\u878d\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose: (1) a unified pipeline for automated and scalable synthesis of simulated environments associated with high-difficulty but easily verifiable tasks; and (2) an environment level RL algorithm that not only effectively mitigates user instability but also performs advantage estimation at the environment level, thereby improving training efficiency and stability.

The effectiveness of such RL training, however, depends critically on the exploration space defined by the pre-trained model's token-output distribution. In this paper, we revisit the standard cross-entropy loss, interpreting it as a specific instance of policy gradient optimization applied within a single-step episode. To systematically study how the pre-trained distribution shapes the exploration potential for subsequent RL, we propose a generalized pre-training objective that adapts on-policy RL principles to supervised learning. By framing next-token prediction as a stochastic decision process, we introduce a reward-shaping strategy that explicitly balances diversity and precision. Our method employs a positive reward scaling factor to control probability concentration on ground-truth tokens and a rank-aware mechanism that treats high-ranking and low-ranking negative tokens asymmetrically. This allows us to reshape the pre-trained token-output distribution and investigate how to provide a more favorable exploration space for RL, ultimately enhancing end-to-end reasoning performance. Contrary to the intuition that higher distribution entropy facilitates effective exploration, we find that imposing a precision-oriented prior yields a superior exploration space for RL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u601d\u60f3\u7684\u901a\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u8c03\u6574\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7eed\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f15\u5165\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u5f62\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6b63\u5411\u5956\u52b1\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u6392\u540d\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6392\u540d\u4e0e\u4f4e\u6392\u540d\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5904\u7406\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u9ad8\u71b5\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u6240\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u6807\u51c6\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u867d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u63a2\u7d22\u6f5c\u529b\u53d7\u5236\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027\u3002\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u4e3b\u52a8\u5851\u9020\u66f4\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u540e\u7eed\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u662f\u4e9f\u5f85\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bcd\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u539f\u5219\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u5f62\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u6b63\u5956\u52b1\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u8bcd\u7684\u6982\u7387\u96c6\u4e2d\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u6392\u540d\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6392\u540d\u4e0e\u4f4e\u6392\u540d\u7684\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u533a\u522b\u5bf9\u5f85\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u9ad8\u71b5\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u5bfc\u5411\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u540e\u7eed\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63a2\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6bd4\u9ad8\u71b5\u5206\u5e03\u66f4\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

A key limitation of existing approaches like Ultra is their reliance on a single relational transformation (e.g., element-wise multiplication) in message passing, which can constrain expressiveness and fail to capture diverse relational and structural patterns exhibited on diverse graphs. In this paper, we propose Gamma, a novel foundation model that introduces multi-head geometric attention to knowledge graph reasoning. Gamma replaces the single relational transformation with multiple parallel ones, including real, complex, split-complex, and dual number based transformations, each designed to model different relational structures. A relational conditioned attention fusion mechanism then adaptively fuses them at link level via a lightweight gating with entropy regularization, allowing the model to robustly emphasize the most appropriate relational bias for each triple pattern. We present a full formalization of these algebraic message functions and discuss how their combination increases expressiveness beyond any single space. Comprehensive experiments on 56 diverse knowledge graphs demonstrate that Gamma consistently outperforms Ultra in zero-shot inductive link prediction, with a 5.5% improvement in mean reciprocal rank on the inductive benchmarks and a 4.4% improvement across all benchmarks, highlighting benefits from complementary geometric representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Gamma proposes a multi-head geometric attention model for knowledge graph reasoning, replacing single relational transformations with multiple parallel ones (real, complex, split-complex, dual numbers), enabling better capture of diverse relational patterns.

The aim of the study was to develop a predictive model for assessing the risk of cardiac death based on the real and synthetic data of patients undergoing PCI and to identify the factors that have the greatest impact on mortality. We analyzed 2,044 patients, who underwent a PCI for bifurcation lesions. The primary outcome was cardiac death at 3-year follow-up. Several machine learning models were applied to predict three-year mortality after PCI. To address class imbalance and improve the representation of the minority class, an additional 500 synthetic samples were generated and added to the training set. To evaluate the contribution of individual features to model performance, we applied permutation feature importance. An additional experiment was conducted to evaluate how the model's predictions would change after removing non-informative features from the training and test datasets. Without oversampling, all models achieve high overall accuracy (0.92-0.93), yet they almost completely ignore the minority class. Across models, augmentation consistently increases minority-class recall with minimal loss of AUROC, improves probability quality, and yields more clinically reasonable risk estimates on the constructed severe profiles. According to feature importance analysis, four features emerged as the most influential: Age, Ejection Fraction, Peripheral Artery Disease, and Cerebrovascular Disease.

Zomorrodi"], "title": "Prompt engineering does not universally improve Large Language Model performance across clinical decision-making tasks", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in medical knowledge assessments, yet their practical utility in real-world clinical decision-making remains underexplored. In this study, we evaluated the performance of three state-of-the-art LLMs-ChatGPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and LIama 3.3 70B-in clinical decision support across the entire clinical reasoning workflow of a typical patient encounter. Using 36 case studies, we first assessed LLM's out-of-the-box performance across five key sequential clinical decision-making tasks under two temperature settings (default vs. zero): differential diagnosis, essential immediate steps, relevant diagnostic testing, final diagnosis, and treatment recommendation. All models showed high variability by task, achieving near-perfect accuracy in final diagnosis, poor performance in relevant diagnostic testing, and moderate performance in remaining tasks. Furthermore, ChatGPT performed better under the zero temperature, whereas LIama showed stronger performance under the default temperature. Next, we assessed whether prompt engineering could enhance LLM performance by applying variations of the MedPrompt framework, incorporating targeted and random dynamic few-shot learning. The results demonstrate that prompt engineering is not a one-size-fit-all solution. While it significantly improved the performance on the task with lowest baseline accuracy (relevant diagnostic testing), it was counterproductive for others. Another key finding was that the targeted dynamic few-shot prompting did not consistently outperform random selection, indicating that the presumed benefits of closely matched examples may be counterbalanced by loss of broader contextual diversity. These findings suggest that the impact of prompt engineering is highly model and task-dependent, highlighting the need for tailored, context-aware strategies for integrating LLMs into healthcare.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08ChatGPT-4o\u3001Gemini 1.5 Pro\u3001LIama 3.3 70B\uff09\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u60a3\u8005\u5c31\u8bca\u5168\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4e94\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5404\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\uff0c\u4f46\u76f8\u5173\u68c0\u67e5\u63a8\u8350\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u57fa\u7ebf\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u80fd\u9002\u5f97\u5176\u53cd\uff1b\u4e14\u76ee\u6807\u52a8\u6001\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u5e76\u672a\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5339\u914d\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u672a\u5fc5\u66f4\u4f18\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u6839\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u6027\u5b9a\u5236\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u5168\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e36\u4e2a\u75c5\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cdLLM\u5728\u4e94\u9879\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff08\u9ed8\u8ba4\u4e0e\u96f6\u6e29\u5ea6\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528MedPrompt\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u6001\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6700\u7ec8\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u8bca\u65ad\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63a8\u8350\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\uff1b\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u4ec5\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6700\u4f4e\u57fa\u7ebf\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e14\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u793a\u672a\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u63d0\u793a\u6548\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e76\u975e\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5176\u6548\u679c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u5e94\u53d1\u5c55\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6574\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

We present a systematic ablation study of a physics-informed grating coupler spectrum generator that maps five geometric parameters to 100-point spectral responses. By selectively removing explicit energy conservation enforcement, Fabry-Perot oscillations, bandwidth variation, and noise, we uncover a physics constraint paradox: explicit energy conservation enforcement is mathematically redundant when the underlying equations are physically consistent, with constrained and unconstrained variants achieving identical conservation accuracy (mean error approximately 7 x 10^-9). In contrast, Fabry-Perot oscillations dominate threshold-based bandwidth variability, accounting for a 72 percent reduction in half-maximum bandwidth spread when removed (with bandwidth spread reduced from 132.3 nm to 37.4 nm). We further identify a subtle pitfall: standard noise-addition-plus-renormalization pipelines introduce 0.5 percent unphysical negative absorption values. The generator operates at 200 samples per second, enabling high-throughput data generation and remaining orders of magnitude faster than typical full-wave solvers reported in the literature. Finally, downstream machine learning evaluation reveals a clear physics-learnability trade-off: while central wavelength prediction remains unaffected, removing Fabry-Perot oscillations improves bandwidth prediction accuracy by 31.3 percent in R-squared and reduces RMSE by 73.8 percent.

Post-training structured pruning offers an efficient solution. However, when few-shot calibration sets fail to adequately reflect the pretraining data distribution, existing methods exhibit limited generalization to downstream tasks. To address this issue, we propose Function-Aware Neuron Grouping (FANG), a post-training pruning framework that alleviates calibration bias by identifying and preserving neurons critical to specific function. FANG groups neurons with similar function based on the type of semantic context they process and prunes each group independently. During importance estimation within each group, tokens that strongly correlate with the functional role of the neuron group are given higher weighting. Additionally, FANG also preserves neurons that contribute across multiple context types. To achieve a better trade-off between sparsity and performance, it allocates sparsity to each block adaptively based on its functional complexity.

Consequently, prevailing approaches tend to rely on uniform frame sampling or static pre-selection, which might overlook critical evidence and unable to correct its initial selection error during its reasoning process. To overcome these limitations, we propose VideoZoomer, a novel agentic framework that enables MLLMs to dynamically control their visual focus during reasoning. Starting from a coarse low-frame-rate overview, VideoZoomer invokes a temporal zoom tool to obtain high-frame-rate clips at autonomously chosen moments, thereby progressively gathering fine-grained evidence in a multi-turn interactive manner. Accordingly, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase on a curated dataset of distilled exemplar and reflection trajectories, followed by reinforcement learning to further refine the agentic policy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 7B model delivers diverse and complex reasoning patterns, yielding strong performance across a broad set of long video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. These emergent capabilities allow it to consistently surpass existing open-source models and even rival proprietary systems on challenging tasks, while achieving superior efficiency under reduced frame budgets.", "AI": {"tldr": "VideoZoomer is a novel agentic framework that enables Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to dynamically control visual focus during long video understanding.

This is especially problematic in K--12 settings, which the EU AI Act classifies as high-risk domain requiring responsible design. Motivated by these concerns, this study synthesises evidence on limitations of LLM-based tutors and empirically investigates one critical issue: the accuracy, reliability, and temporal coherence of assessing learners' evolving knowledge over time. We compare a deep knowledge tracing (DKT) model with a widely used LLM, evaluated zero-shot and fine-tuned, using a large open-access dataset. Results show that DKT achieves the highest discrimination performance (AUC = 0.83) on next-step correctness prediction and consistently outperforms the LLM across settings. Although fine-tuning improves the LLM's AUC by approximately 8\\% over the zero-shot baseline, it remains 6\\% below DKT and produces higher early-sequence errors, where incorrect predictions are most harmful for adaptive support. Temporal analyses further reveal that DKT maintains stable, directionally correct mastery updates, whereas LLM variants exhibit substantial temporal weaknesses, including inconsistent and wrong-direction updates. These limitations persist despite the fine-tuned LLM requiring nearly 198 hours of high-compute training, far exceeding the computational demands of DKT. Our qualitative analysis of multi-skill mastery estimation further shows that, even after fine-tuning, the LLM produced inconsistent mastery trajectories, while DKT maintained smooth and coherent updates. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs alone are unlikely to match the effectiveness of established intelligent tutoring systems, and that responsible tutoring requires hybrid frameworks that incorporate learner modelling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728K-12\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u77e5\u8bc6\u52a8\u6001\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff08DKT\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\uff0cLLM\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8eDKT\uff08AUC 0.83\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5e8f\u5217\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u9ad8\u3001\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u6295\u5165\u8fd1198\u5c0f\u65f6\u9ad8\u7b97\u529b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0cLLM\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4ecd\u4e0d\u53ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u5f97\u591a\u7684DKT\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793aLLM\u5728\u591a\u6280\u80fd\u638c\u63e1\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u800cDKT\u5219\u4fdd\u6301\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fde\u8d2f\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u4ec5\u9760LLM\u96be\u4ee5\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5bfc\u9700\u91c7\u7528\u878d\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728K-12\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bef\u89e3\uff1a\u8ba4\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u53d6\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u5efa\u6a21\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6559\u5b66\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6b27\u76df\u300a\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6cd5\u6848\u300b\u5c06K-12\u6559\u80b2\u5217\u4e3a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u77e5\u8bc6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u9677\u5bfc\u81f4\u6709\u5bb3\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7efc\u5408\u73b0\u6709\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff08DKT\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u7248\u672c\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0b\u4e00\u9898\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08AUC\uff09\u3001\u65e9\u671f\u5e8f\u5217\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u4ee5\u53ca\u957f\u671f\u77e5\u8bc6\u638c\u63e1\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u591a\u6280\u80fd\u638c\u63e1\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "DKT\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u4e00\u9898\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff08AUC = 0.83\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684LLM\u3002\u5fae\u8c03\u867d\u4f7fLLM AUC\u63d0\u5347\u7ea68%\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u843d\u540e\u4e8eDKT 6%\u3002\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0cLLM\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u751a\u81f3\u53cd\u5411\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8fd1198\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u9ad8\u7b97\u529b\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u8fdc\u4e0d\u53ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684DKT\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e5f\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684LLM\u5728\u591a\u6280\u80fd\u638c\u63e1\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u5448\u73b0\u4e0d\u8fde\u8d2f\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u800cDKT\u59cb\u7ec8\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u5408\u7406\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u96be\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u4f20\u7edf\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u7684K-12\u6559\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e94\u6784\u5efa\u878d\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6559\u5b66\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Current LLMs cannot natively ingest long-duration sensor streams, and paired sensor-text datasets are scarce. To address these challenges, we introduce LENS, a framework that aligns multimodal sensing data with language models to generate clinically grounded mental-health narratives. LENS first constructs a large-scale dataset by transforming Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) responses related to depression and anxiety symptoms into natural-language descriptions, yielding over 100,000 sensor-text QA pairs from 258 participants. To enable native time-series integration, we train a patch-level encoder that projects raw sensor signals directly into an LLM's representation space. Our results show that LENS outperforms strong baselines on standard NLP metrics and task-specific measures of symptom-severity accuracy. A user study with 13 mental-health professionals further indicates that LENS-produced narratives are comprehensive and clinically meaningful. Ultimately, our approach advances LLMs as interfaces for health sensing, providing a scalable path toward models that can reason over raw behavioral signals and support downstream clinical decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "LENS is a framework that aligns multimodal sensor data with language models to generate clinical mental-health narratives.

However, most edits involve modifying only small regions, while current methods uniformly process and denoise all tokens at every timestep, causing redundant computation and potentially degrading unchanged areas. This raises a fundamental question: Is it truly necessary to regenerate every region during editing? To address this, we propose SpotEdit, a training-free diffusion editing framework that selectively updates only the modified regions. SpotEdit comprises two key components: SpotSelector identifies stable regions via perceptual similarity and skips their computation by reusing conditional image features; SpotFusion adaptively blends these features with edited tokens through a dynamic fusion mechanism, preserving contextual coherence and editing quality.

We argue this metric confuses unfaithfulness with incompleteness, the lossy compression needed to turn distributed transformer computation into a linear natural language narrative. On multi-hop reasoning tasks with Llama-3 and Gemma-3, many CoTs flagged as unfaithful by Biasing Features are judged faithful by other metrics, exceeding 50% in some models. With a new faithful@k metric, we show that larger inference-time token budgets greatly increase hint verbalization (up to 90% in some settings), suggesting much apparent unfaithfulness is due to tight token limits. Using Causal Mediation Analysis, we further show that even non-verbalized hints can causally mediate prediction changes through the CoT. We therefore caution against relying solely on hint-based evaluations and advocate a broader interpretability toolkit, including causal mediation and corruption-based metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u7279\u5f81\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5c06\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6df7\u6dc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u8bb8\u591a\u88ab\u6807\u8bb0\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u6307\u6807\u4e0b\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u5fe0\u5b9e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684faithful@k\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u7b97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe90%\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u770b\u4f3c\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u53ef\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u9650\u5236\u3002\u56e0\u679c\u4e2d\u4ecb\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u672a\u663e\u5f0f\u8868\u8ff0\u7684\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e5f\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u56e0\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u547c\u5401\u907f\u514d\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e94\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5de5\u5177\u5305\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u56e0\u679c\u4e2d\u4ecb\u548c\u7834\u574f\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u89c1\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u4e2d\u9057\u6f0f\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u7ebf\u7d22\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u5224\u65ad\u53ef\u80fd\u8bef\u5c06\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u5f53\u4f5c\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8bef\u5bfc\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fafaithful@k\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56e0\u679c\u4e2d\u4ecb\u5206\u6790\uff08Causal Mediation Analysis\uff09\u4e0e\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\uff08Llama-3\u3001Gemma-3\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7684\u7ebf\u7d22\u8868\u8fbe\u60c5\u51b5\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc750%\u88ab\u504f\u89c1\u7279\u5f81\u6307\u6807\u6807\u8bb0\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u6307\u6807\u4e0b\u88ab\u5224\u5b9a\u4e3a\u5fe0\u5b9e\uff1b\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u7b97\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe90%\uff09\uff1b\u5373\u4f7f\u672a\u663e\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u7ebf\u7d22\u4ecd\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u56e0\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u7ec8\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u4f9d\u8d56\u63d0\u793a\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u3002\u5e94\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u7834\u574f\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b49\u591a\u5143\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches primarily focus on forward modeling, e.g., learning holistic mappings from text to motion or composing a complex motion from a set of motion concepts. In this paper, we consider the inverse perspective: decomposing a holistic motion into semantically meaningful sub-components. We propose DeMoGen, a compositional training paradigm for decompositional learning that employs an energy-based diffusion model. This energy formulation directly captures the composed distribution of multiple motion concepts, enabling the model to discover them without relying on ground-truth motions for individual concepts. Within this paradigm, we introduce three training variants to encourage a decompositional understanding of motion: 1. DeMoGen-Exp explicitly trains on decomposed text prompts; 2. DeMoGen-OSS performs orthogonal self-supervised decomposition; 3. DeMoGen-SC enforces semantic consistency between original and decomposed text embeddings.

We present a hierarchical stacking optimization framework with a Dirichlet's Process (SoDip), a hierarchical data-driven framework integrating: (1) a decoder-only Transformer (DeepSeek-R1) to encode textual process descriptors (irradiation source, grafting type, substrate manufacturer); (2) TabNet and XGBoost for modelling multimodal feature interactions; (3) Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Dirichlet Process Mixture Models (DPMM) for uncertainty quantification and heteroscedasticity; and (4) Bayesian Optimization for efficient exploration of high-dimensional synthesis space. A diverse dataset was curated using ChemDataExtractor 2.0 and WebPlotDigitizer, incorporating numerical and textual variables across hundreds of RIG studies. In cross-validation, SoDip achieved ~33% improvement over GPR while providing calibrated confidence intervals that identify low-reproducibility regimes.

We introduce Prompt Choreography, a framework that efficiently executes LLM workflows by maintaining a dynamic, global KV cache. Each LLM call can attend to an arbitrary, reordered subset of previously encoded messages. Parallel calls are supported. Though caching messages' encodings sometimes gives different results from re-encoding them in a new context, we show in diverse settings that fine-tuning the LLM to work with the cache can help it mimic the original results.

Although radiomics-based machine learning methods have shown promise for this task, conventional unimodal and early-fusion approaches are often limited by high feature redundancy and an incomplete modeling of modality-specific information. In this work, we introduce a multi-view latent representation learning framework based on variational autoencoders (VAE) to integrate complementary radiomic features derived from post-contrast T1-weighted (T1Gd) and Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By encoding each modality through an independent probabilistic encoder and performing fusion in a compact latent space, the proposed approach preserves modality-specific structure while enabling effective multimodal integration. The resulting latent embeddings are subsequently used for MGMT promoter methylation classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08VAE\uff09\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u878d\u5408\u6765\u81ea\u589e\u5f3aT1\u52a0\u6743\uff08T1Gd\uff09\u548c\u6db2\u4f53\u8870\u51cf\u53cd\u8f6c\u6062\u590d\uff08FLAIR\uff09MRI\u7684\u653e\u5c04\u7ec4\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u63a8\u65ad\u80f6\u8d28\u6bcd\u7ec6\u80de\u7624\uff08GBM\uff09\u4e2d\u7684MGMT\u542f\u52a8\u5b50\u7532\u57fa\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u6982\u7387\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bf9\u6bcf\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u65e2\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53c8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u6216\u65e9\u671f\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u5197\u4f59\u9ad8\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5bf9MGMT\u542f\u52a8\u5b50\u7532\u57fa\u5316\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u5206\u5b50\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u63a8\u65ad\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08VAE\uff09\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5bf9T1Gd\u548cFLAIR MRI\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u653e\u5c04\u7ec4\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u72ec\u7acb\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u7ef4\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5404\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e92\u8865\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4bGBM\u60a3\u8005MGMT\u542f\u52a8\u5b50\u7532\u57fa\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u65e9\u671f\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eVAE\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5f71\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u653e\u5c04\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5b66\u4e2d\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u5206\u5b50\u7279\u5f81\u63a8\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f6c\u5316\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, we identify two fundamental limitations. First, the optimal policy depends on arbitrary modeling choices (scalarization function, reference policy), yielding behavior reflecting parameterization artifacts rather than true preferences. Second, treating response generation in isolation fails to leverage comparative information in pairwise data, leaving the model's capacity for intrinsic self-reflection untapped. To address it, we propose Intrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (\\q), deriving a globally optimal policy conditioning on both context and alternative responses. We prove this formulation superior to DPO/RLHF while guaranteeing invariance to scalarization and reference choices. \\q~serves as a plug-and-play enhancement without architectural changes or inference overhead. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in win rates and length-controlled metrics, validating that unlocking self-reflection yields more robust, human-aligned LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aIntrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (ISPO)\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3DPO\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u5bf9\u9f50\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u6839\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u5efa\u6a21\u9009\u62e9\uff08\u5982\u6807\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u53c2\u8003\u7b56\u7565\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u884c\u4e3a\u53cd\u6620\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4f2a\u5f71\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u504f\u597d\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u5b64\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u6210\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5728\u81ea\u7701\u80fd\u529b\u3002ISPO\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u5907\u9009\u54cd\u5e94\u6765\u63a8\u5bfc\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8eDPO/RLHF\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5bf9\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\u6216\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u53ef\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u80dc\u7387\u548c\u957f\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6fc0\u53d1\u81ea\u7701\u80fd\u529b\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982DPO\u867d\u7136\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u79bb\u7ebf\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u5927\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u5176\u4e00\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u53d7\u5236\u4e8e\u4eba\u4e3a\u8bbe\u5b9a\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u4e0e\u53c2\u8003\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u53cd\u6620\u7684\u662f\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u504f\u597d\uff1b\u5176\u4e8c\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u6210\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u5185\u5728\u81ea\u7701\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u5185\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faIntrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (ISPO)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0e\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6807\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u6216\u53c2\u8003\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u5efa\u6a21\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6210\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u7701\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cISPO\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80dc\u7387\u548c\u957f\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u76f8\u5173\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u52a8\u6216\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u81ea\u7701\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "ISPO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u53ef\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5185\u5728\u81ea\u53cd\u601d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5efa\u6a21\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While effective for approximate similarity search, this design introduces fundamental non-determinism: identical models, inputs, and code can produce different memory states and retrieval results across hardware architectures (e.g., x86 vs. ARM). This prevents replayability and safe deployment, leading to silent data divergence that prevents post-hoc verification and compromises audit trails in regulated sectors. We present Valori, a deterministic AI memory substrate that replaces floating-point memory operations with fixed-point arithmetic (Q16.16) and models memory as a replayable state machine. Valori guarantees bit-identical memory states, snapshots, and search results across platforms. We demonstrate that non-determinism arises before indexing or retrieval and show how Valori enforces determinism at the memory boundary. Our results suggest that deterministic memory is a necessary primitive for trustworthy AI systems.

ModernBERT consolidates these advances by integrating Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), FlashAttention, and refined normalization. Despite these developments, Turkish NLP lacks a monolingual encoder trained from scratch incorporating such modern architectural paradigms. This work introduces TabiBERT, a monolingual Turkish encoder based on ModernBERT architecture trained from scratch on a large, curated corpus. TabiBERT is pre-trained on one trillion tokens sampled from an 84.88B token multi-domain corpus: web text (73%), scientific publications (20%), source code (6%), and mathematical content (0.3%). The model supports 8,192-token context length (16x original BERT), achieves up to 2.65x inference speedup, and reduces GPU memory consumption, enabling larger batch sizes. We introduce TabiBench with 28 datasets across eight task categories with standardized splits and protocols, evaluated using GLUE-style macro-averaging.

However, moving such cancer cases forward for treatment requires accurate on the amount of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein expression. Predicting both the lower and higher levels of HER2 can be challenging. Moreover, jointly analyzing H&E and immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained images for HER2 scoring is difficult. Although several deep learning methods have been investigated to address the challenge of HER2 scoring, they suffer from providing a pixel-level localization of HER2 status. In this study, we propose a single end-to-end pipeline using a system of vision transformers with HER2 status scoring on whole slide images of WSIs. The method includes patch-wise processing of H&E WSIs for tumor localization. A novel mapping function is proposed to correspondingly identify correlated IHC WSIs regions with malignant regions on H&E. A clinically inspired HER2 scoring mechanism is embedded in the pipeline and allows for automatic pixel-level annotation of 4-way HER2 scoring (0, 1+, 2+, and 3+). Also, the proposed method accurately returns HER2-negative and HER2-positive. Privately curated datasets were collaboratively extracted from 13 different cases of WSIs of H&E and IHC. A thorough experiment is conducted on the proposed method. Results obtained showed a good classification accuracy during tumor localization. Also, a classification accuracy of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.933 were returned for the prediction of HER2 status, scoring in the 4-way methods. The applicability of the proposed pipeline was investigated using WSIs patches as comparable to human pathologists. Findings from the study showed the usability of jointly evaluated H&E and IHC images on end-to-end ViTs-based models for HER2 scoring", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u538b\u5668\uff08ViT\uff09\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u5207\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\uff08WSI\uff09\u4e0a\u7684HER2\u72b6\u6001\u8bc4\u5206\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7H&E\u67d3\u8272\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u80bf\u7624\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5c06H&E\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u6076\u6027\u533a\u57df\u4e0e\u76f8\u5e94\u7684IHC\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\u5bf9\u5e94\u8d77\u6765\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u542f\u53d1\u7684HER2\u8bc4\u5206\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b04\u7ea7HER2\u8bc4\u5206\uff080, 1+, 2+, 3+\uff09\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5e76\u51c6\u786e\u533a\u5206HER2\u9634\u6027\u548c\u9633\u6027\u3002\u572813\u4e2a\u75c5\u4f8b\u7684\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5145\u5206\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u80bf\u7624\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51c6\u786e\uff0cHER2\u72b6\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a0.94\uff0c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4e3a0.933\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4f7f\u7528WSI\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "HER2\u86cb\u767d\u8868\u8fbe\u6c34\u5e73\u5bf9\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u6cbb\u7597\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u6790H&E\u548cIHC\u56fe\u50cf\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684HER2\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u7f3a\u4e4f\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u8054\u5408\u5904\u7406\u4e24\u79cd\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u51c6\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u538b\u5668\uff08ViT\uff09\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u5bf9H&E WSI\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5757\u5904\u7406\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80bf\u7624\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u578b\u6620\u5c04\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5173\u8054H&E\u4e0eIHC\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u533a\u57df\uff1b3\uff09\u5d4c\u5165\u4e34\u5e8a\u542f\u53d1\u76844\u7ea7HER2\u8bc4\u5206\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\uff1b4\uff09\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b8c\u6210\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684HER2\u72b6\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u80bf\u7624\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e4\u7ea7HER2\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u52300.94\uff0c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4e3a0.933\uff1b\u5728\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408H&E\u4e0eIHC\u56fe\u50cf\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u7684HER2\u72b6\u6001\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u75c5\u7406\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Human EI often involves a phenomenological component and a sense of understanding that artificially intelligent systems lack; therefore, some aspects of EI are irrelevant in evaluating AI systems. However, EI also includes an ability to sense an emotional state, explain it, respond appropriately, and adapt to new contexts (e.g., multicultural), and artificially intelligent systems can do such things to greater or lesser degrees. Several benchmark frameworks specialize in evaluating the capacity of different AI models to perform some tasks related to EI, but these often lack a solid foundation regarding the nature of emotion and what it is to be emotionally intelligent. In this project, we begin by reviewing different theories about emotion and general EI, evaluating the extent to which each is applicable to artificial systems. We then critically evaluate the available benchmark frameworks, identifying where each falls short in light of the account of EI developed in the first section. Lastly, we outline some options for improving evaluation strategies to avoid these shortcomings in EI evaluation in AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08AI\uff09\u60c5\u7eea\u667a\u529b\uff08EI\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u672a\u80fd\u5168\u9762\u8861\u91cf\u4e0eAI\u76f8\u5173\u7684EI\u5404\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002\u867d\u7136\u4eba\u7c7b\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u529b\u5305\u542b\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u5c42\u9762\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u611f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5728AI\u4e2d\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u4f46AI\u4ecd\u53ef\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5730\u611f\u77e5\u60c5\u7eea\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u60c5\u7eea\u3001\u9002\u5f53\u56de\u5e94\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u60c5\u5883\uff08\u5982\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u73af\u5883\uff09\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\u867d\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540cAI\u6a21\u578b\u6267\u884c\u67d0\u4e9b\u4e0e\u60c5\u611f\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u60c5\u7eea\u672c\u8d28\u53ca\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u529b\u5185\u6db5\u7684\u575a\u5b9e\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u672c\u6587\u9996\u5148\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u7eea\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u4e00\u822c\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u529b\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff1b\u63a5\u7740\u6279\u5224\u6027\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u82e5\u5e72\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u60c5\u7eea\u667a\u529b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u6db5\u76d6\u4e0eAI\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5173\u952e\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u529b\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u7eea\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u529b\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff1b\u6279\u5224\u6027\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e0a\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u5168\u9762\u7684AI\u60c5\u7eea\u667a\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u60c5\u7eea\u667a\u529b\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u60c5\u7eea\u672c\u8d28\u7684\u6df1\u523b\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u91cd\u6784\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u65e2\u53cd\u6620\u4eba\u7c7b\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u529b\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u8981\u7d20\uff0c\u53c8\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\u3002"}}

Adedigbaa", "Rammohan Mallipeddi"], "title": "Cluster Aggregated GAN (CAG): A Cluster-Based Hybrid Model for Appliance Pattern Generation", "comment": "18pages, 5Figues", "summary": "Synthetic appliance data are essential for developing non-intrusive load monitoring algorithms and enabling privacy preserving energy research, yet the scarcity of labeled datasets remains a significant barrier. Recent GAN-based methods have demonstrated the feasibility of synthesizing load patterns, but most existing approaches treat all devices uniformly within a single model, neglecting the behavioral differences between intermittent and continuous appliances and resulting in unstable training and limited output fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose the Cluster Aggregated GAN framework, a hybrid generative approach that routes each appliance to a specialized branch based on its behavioral characteristics. For intermittent appliances, a clustering module groups similar activation patterns and allocates dedicated generators for each cluster, ensuring that both common and rare operational modes receive adequate modeling capacity. Continuous appliances follow a separate branch that employs an LSTM-based generator to capture gradual temporal evolution while maintaining training stability through sequence compression. Extensive experiments on the UVIC smart plug dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms baseline methods across metrics measuring realism, diversity, and training stability, and that integrating clustering as an active generative component substantially improves both interpretability and scalability.

We then test popular open-weight LLMs for generating TLDRs based on abstracts. Our analysis reveals that, although some of them successfully produce humanoid summaries, LLMs generally exhibit a greater affinity for the original text's lexical choices and rhetorical structures, hence tend to be more extractive rather than abstractive in general, compared to humans.

In this paper, we bridge this critical gap by tackling three key challenges in 3D object arrangement task using MLLMs. First, to address the weak visual grounding of MLLMs, which struggle to link programmatic edits with precise 3D outcomes, we introduce an MCP-based API. This shifts the interaction from brittle raw code manipulation to more robust, function-level updates. Second, we augment the MLLM's 3D scene understanding with a suite of specialized visual tools to analyze scene state, gather spatial information, and validate action outcomes. This perceptual feedback loop is critical for closing the gap between language-based updates and precise 3D-aware manipulation. Third, to manage the iterative, error-prone updates, we propose a collaborative multi-agent framework with designated roles for planning, execution, and verification. This decomposition allows the system to robustly handle multi-step instructions and recover from intermediate errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a diverse set of 25 complex object arrangement tasks, where it significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Treating an LLM's output (\"model choice\") as a single data point underutilizes the information inherent to the probabilistic nature of LLMs. This paper introduces and formalizes \"model belief,\" a measure derived from an LLM's token-level probabilities that captures the model's belief distribution over choice alternatives in a single generation run. The authors prove that model belief is asymptotically equivalent to the mean of model choices (a non-trivial property) but forms a more statistically efficient estimator, with lower variance and a faster convergence rate. Analogous properties are shown to hold for smooth functions of model belief and model choice often used in downstream applications. The authors demonstrate the performance of model belief through a demand estimation study, where an LLM simulates consumer responses to different prices. In practical settings with limited numbers of runs, model belief explains and predicts ground-truth model choice better than model choice itself, and reduces the computation needed to reach sufficiently accurate estimates by roughly a factor of 20. The findings support using model belief as the default measure to extract more information from LLM-generated data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86\u201c\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u5ff5\u201d\u8fd9\u4e00\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u5355\u6b21\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9009\u9879\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5728\u6e10\u8fd1\u4e0a\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5747\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u66f4\u5feb\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u662f\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002\u5728\u9700\u6c42\u4f30\u8ba1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u5ff5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8fd0\u884c\u6b21\u6570\u4e0b\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u771f\u5b9e\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea620\u500d\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d0\u53d6LLM\u6570\u636e\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u9ed8\u8ba4\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ec5\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u89c6\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u70b9\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u5176\u6982\u7387\u7279\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u66f4\u5145\u5206\u6316\u6398\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u53cd\u6620\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5728\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u201c\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u5ff5\u201d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u7684token\u7ea7\u6982\u7387\u6784\u5efa\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u5747\u503c\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u53ca\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u9700\u6c42\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u751f\u6210\u6b21\u6570\u4e0b\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u771f\u5b9e\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e14\u6240\u9700\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea620\u500d\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u66f4\u5feb\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ece\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u9ed8\u8ba4\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5229\u7528\u7387\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, a notable discrepancy exists between their training and inference procedures. In particular, MDM inference is a multi-step, iterative process governed not only by the model itself but also by various schedules that dictate the token-decoding trajectory (e.g., how many tokens to decode at each step). In contrast, MDMs are typically trained using a simplified, single-step BERT-style objective that masks a subset of tokens and predicts all of them simultaneously. This step-level simplification fundamentally disconnects the training paradigm from the trajectory-level nature of inference, leaving the inference schedules never optimized during training. In this paper, we introduce Co-GRPO, which reformulates MDM generation as a unified Markov Decision Process (MDP) that jointly incorporates both the model and the inference schedule. By applying Group Relative Policy Optimization at the trajectory level, Co-GRPO cooperatively optimizes model parameters and schedule parameters under a shared reward, without requiring costly backpropagation through the multi-step generation process. This holistic optimization aligns training with inference more thoroughly and substantially improves generation quality. Empirical results across four benchmarks-ImageReward, HPS, GenEval, and DPG-Bench-demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Self-E learns from data similarly to a Flow Matching model, while simultaneously employing a novel self-evaluation mechanism: it evaluates its own generated samples using its current score estimates, effectively serving as a dynamic self-teacher. Unlike traditional diffusion or flow models, it does not rely solely on local supervision, which typically necessitates many inference steps. Unlike distillation-based approaches, it does not require a pretrained teacher. This combination of instantaneous local learning and self-driven global matching bridges the gap between the two paradigms, enabling the training of a high-quality text-to-image model from scratch that excels even at very low step counts. Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image benchmarks show that Self-E not only excels in few-step generation, but is also competitive with state-of-the-art Flow Matching models at 50 steps. We further find that its performance improves monotonically as inference steps increase, enabling both ultra-fast few-step generation and high-quality long-trajectory sampling within a single unified model.

R"], "title": "When Algorithms Manage Humans: A Double Machine Learning Approach to Estimating Nonlinear Effects of Algorithmic Control on Gig Worker Performance and Wellbeing", "comment": null, "summary": "A central question for the future of work is whether person centered management can survive when algorithms take on managerial roles. Standard tools often miss what is happening because worker responses to algorithmic systems are rarely linear. We use a Double Machine Learning framework to estimate a moderated mediation model without imposing restrictive functional forms. Using survey data from 464 gig workers, we find a clear nonmonotonic pattern. Supportive HR practices improve worker wellbeing, but their link to performance weakens in a murky middle where algorithmic oversight is present yet hard to interpret. The relationship strengthens again when oversight is transparent and explainable. These results show why simple linear specifications can miss the pattern and sometimes suggest the opposite conclusion. For platform design, the message is practical: control that is only partly defined creates confusion, but clear rules and credible recourse can make strong oversight workable.

The system leverages on-device semantic segmentation, LiDAR-based depth estimation, and fused GPS/IMU data to detect and localize sidewalk-relevant features such as traffic signs, traffic lights and poles. To ensure transparency and improve data quality, iOSPointMapper incorporates a user-guided annotation interface for validating system outputs before submission.

Low-rank adaptation methods such as LoRA operate under the assumption that task-relevant weight updates reside in a low-rank subspace, yet this subspace is learned implicitly from data in a black-box manner, offering no interpretability or direct control. We hypothesize that this difficulty stems from polysemanticity--individual dimensions encoding multiple entangled concepts. To address this, we leverage pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant features in a disentangled feature space, then construct an explicit, interpretable low-rank subspace to guide adapter initialization. We provide theoretical analysis proving that under monosemanticity assumptions, SAE-based subspace identification achieves arbitrarily small recovery error, while direct identification in polysemantic space suffers an irreducible error floor. On safety alignment, our method achieves up to 99.6% safety rate--exceeding full fine-tuning by 7.4 percentage points and approaching RLHF-based methods--while updating only 0.19-0.24% of parameters. Crucially, our method provides interpretable insights into the learned alignment subspace through the semantic grounding of SAE features.

Diffusion models achieve high accuracy by formulating detection as a multi-step stochastic denoising process, but their reliance on numerous sampling steps ($T \\gg 60$) makes them impractical for time-sensitive clinical applications like Crohn's Disease detection in Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE). DeFloMat replaces this slow stochastic path with a highly direct, deterministic flow field derived from Conditional Optimal Transport (OT) theory, specifically approximating the Rectified Flow. This shift enables fast inference via a simple Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver. We demonstrate the superiority of DeFloMat on a challenging MRE clinical dataset. Crucially, DeFloMat achieves state-of-the-art accuracy ($43.32\\% \\text{ } AP_{10:50}$) in only $3$ inference steps, which represents a $1.4\\times$ performance improvement over DiffusionDet's maximum converged performance ($31.03\\% \\text{ } AP_{10:50}$ at $4$ steps).

Conformant planning is the task of finding a sequential plan that achieves a given objective independent of non-deterministic action effects during the plan's execution. Hyperproperties are system properties that relate multiple execution traces of a system and, e.g., capture information-flow and fairness policies. In this paper, we show that model-checking of $\\exists^*\\forall^*$ hyperproperties is closely related to the problem of computing a conformant plan. Firstly, we show that we can efficiently reduce a hyperproperty model-checking instance to a conformant planning instance, and prove that our encoding is sound and complete. Secondly, we establish the converse direction: Every conformant planning problem is, itself, a hyperproperty model-checking task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7b26\u5408\u6027\u89c4\u5212\uff08conformant planning\uff09\u4e0e\u8d85\u6027\u8d28\uff08hyperproperties\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c$\\exists^*\\forall^*$\u578b\u8d85\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7b26\u5408\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u8f6c\u6362\u662f\u4fdd\u771f\u4e14\u5b8c\u5907\u7684\uff1b\u53cd\u4e4b\uff0c\u4efb\u4f55\u7b26\u5408\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u4e5f\u53ef\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d85\u6027\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u5173\u6ce8\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u4f5c\u6548\u679c\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u800c\u8d85\u6027\u8d28\u5219\u7528\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0\u591a\u6761\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u95f4\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u4e8c\u8005\u867d\u5206\u5c5e\u4e0d\u540c\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u5173\u8054\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u5b83\u4eec\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6280\u672f\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u590d\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u53cc\u5411\u5f52\u7ea6\uff1a\u4e00\u65b9\u9762\u5c06\u8d85\u6027\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7b26\u5408\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\uff1b\u53e6\u4e00\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5c06\u7b26\u5408\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a$\\exists^*\\forall^*$\u8d85\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8d85\u6027\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7b26\u5408\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\uff1a\u4efb\u610f$\\exists^*\\forall^*$\u8d85\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u5747\u53ef\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b26\u5408\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u53cd\u4e4b\u4ea6\u7136\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u4e24\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7b26\u5408\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e$\\exists^*\\forall^*$\u8d85\u6027\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u8fd9\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e24\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u672c\u8d28\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5229\u7528\u8d85\u6027\u8d28\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\u89e3\u51b3\u7b26\u5408\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6216\u53cd\u5411\u4f7f\u7528\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u8d85\u6027\u8d28\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

In experiments reported here, models exposed to such warnings reproduced the flagged content at rates statistically indistinguishable from models given the content directly (76.7% vs. 83.3%). Why? Sparse autoencoder analysis points to a failure of orthogonalization: \"describing X\" and \"performing X\" activate overlapping latent features. Feature #8684, which tracks code execution patterns, fires at comparable magnitude in both warning and exploitation contexts. A related phenomenon, what I call \"stealth slip\", allows conversational preambles to rotate activations into subspaces that linear probes miss entirely. Prompting and inference-time steering do not fix this; training-time feature ablation does. The upshot is that statistical co-occurrence dominates over pragmatic interpretation in current architectures. Models learn what tends to follow a context, not why it appeared there.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8b66\u544a\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\uff08\u5982\"\u4e0d\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u2014\u2014\u6b64\u4ee3\u7801\u5b58\u5728\u6f0f\u6d1e\"\uff09\u5e76\u672a\u6709\u6548\u6559\u4f1a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u907f\u514d\u5371\u9669\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u63a5\u89e6\u6b64\u7c7b\u8b66\u544a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u76f4\u63a5\u63a5\u6536\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u91cd\u73b0\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4ee3\u7801\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0876.7% vs. 83.3%\uff09\u3002\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u975e\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u63cf\u8ff0\u67d0\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u8be5\u884c\u4e3a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e86\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u7279\u5f81#8684\u5728\u8b66\u544a\u548c\u5229\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5747\u5f3a\u70c8\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u662f\u7edf\u8ba1\u5171\u73b0\u800c\u975e\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u56fe\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c'\u9690\u853d\u6ed1\u8131'\u73b0\u8c61\u4f7f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u524d\u7f00\u53ef\u5c06\u6fc0\u6d3b\u65cb\u8f6c\u81f3\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u552f\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7279\u5f81\u6d88\u878d\u624d\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5171\u73b0\u80dc\u8fc7\u8bed\u7528\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u662f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u540e\u7eed\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u8b66\u544a\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u5bfc\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u907f\u514d\u5371\u9669\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u8b66\u544a\u65f6\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a5\u6536\u8b66\u544a\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u76f4\u63a5\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5206\u6790\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6fc0\u6d3b\u65cb\u8f6c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u504f\u5dee\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8b66\u544a\u4e0e\u975e\u8b66\u544a\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u91cd\u73b0\u98ce\u9669\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u6982\u7387\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u7279\u5f81#8684\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u5747\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7279\u5f81\u672a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\uff1b\u9690\u853d\u6ed1\u8131\u73b0\u8c61\u5bfc\u81f4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u88ab\u9690\u85cf\u4e8e\u63a2\u6d4b\u76f2\u533a\uff1b\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u63a7\u5236\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u4ec5\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7279\u5f81\u6d88\u878d\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u7edf\u8ba1\u5171\u73b0\u800c\u975e\u8bed\u7528\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u771f\u6b63\u5185\u5316\u8b66\u544a\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u5fc5\u987b\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c42\u9762\u5e72\u9884\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

Unlike previous morph research focused on text-based evasion in social media and underground industries, LiveAMR targets pronunciation-based evasion in health and medical live streams. We constructed the first LiveAMR dataset with 86,790 samples and developed a method to transform the task into a text-to-text generation problem. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate additional training data, we improved performance and demonstrated that morph resolution significantly enhances live streaming regulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faLiveAMR\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u56fd\u7535\u5546\u5e73\u53f0\uff08\u5982\u6296\u97f3\uff09\u5065\u5eb7\u533b\u7597\u76f4\u64ad\u4e2d\u4e3b\u64ad\u901a\u8fc7\u53d1\u97f3\u53d8\u5f02\u89c4\u907f\u76d1\u7ba1\u7684\u865a\u5047\u5e7f\u544a\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5305\u542b86,790\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684LiveAMR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u5230\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u53d8\u4f53\u89e3\u6790\u5728\u76f4\u64ad\u76d1\u7ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7535\u5546\u76f4\u64ad\u4e2d\u4e3b\u64ad\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u53d1\u97f3\u53d8\u5316\uff08morphs\uff09\u9003\u907f\u76d1\u7ba1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5065\u5eb7\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u865a\u5047\u5ba3\u4f20\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6709\u6548\u6280\u672f\u624b\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u6cbb\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u9996\u4e2aLiveAMR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5c06\u8bed\u97f3\u53d8\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u5230\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u53d1\u97f3\u53d8\u5f02\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u53d1\u97f3\u53d8\u5f02\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u5728\u76f4\u64ad\u5185\u5bb9\u76d1\u7ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "LiveAMR\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6cbb\u7406\u76f4\u64ad\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u89c4\u907f\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u52a0\u5f3a\u5065\u5eb7\u533b\u7597\u7c7b\u76f4\u64ad\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u5408\u89c4\u76d1\u7ba1\u3002"}}

We address this gap by introducing Bright-4B, a 4 billion parameter foundation model that learns on the unit hypersphere to segment subcellular structures directly from 3D brightfield volumes. Bright-4B combines a hardware-aligned Native Sparse Attention mechanism (capturing local, coarse, and selected global context), depth-width residual HyperConnections that stabilize representation flow, and a soft Mixture-of-Experts for adaptive capacity. A plug-and-play anisotropic patch embed further respects confocal point-spread and axial thinning, enabling geometry-faithful 3D tokenization. The resulting model produces morphology-accurate segmentations of nuclei, mitochondria, and other organelles from brightfield stacks alone--without fluorescence, auxiliary channels, or handcrafted post-processing. Across multiple confocal datasets, Bright-4B preserves fine structural detail across depth and cell types, outperforming contemporary CNN and Transformer baselines.

We identify three core cognitive challenges hindering this transition: spatial reasoning, long-horizon state tracking via mental simulation, and active exploration under partial observation. To isolate and evaluate these faculties, we introduce CubeBench, a novel generative benchmark centered on the Rubik's Cube. CubeBench uses a three-tiered diagnostic framework that progressively assesses agent capabilities, from foundational state tracking with full symbolic information to active exploration with only partial visual data.

To achieve these goals, we develop a framework composed of 11 specialized agents,including topic analysts, case analysts, editors, a narrator, and proofreaders that work in concert to explore themes, extract real world cases, refine content organization, and synthesize natural spoken language.

A large-scale, high-quality local image retrieval database, covering eight categories including cars, animals, and plants, endows model with robust object recognition despite its small size.

Recent research on autonomous agents has increasingly focused on designing efficient memory workflows by drawing on cognitive neuroscience. However, constrained by interdisciplinary barriers, existing works struggle to assimilate the essence of human memory mechanisms. To bridge this gap, we systematically synthesizes interdisciplinary knowledge of memory, connecting insights from cognitive neuroscience with LLM-driven agents. Specifically, we first elucidate the definition and function of memory along a progressive trajectory from cognitive neuroscience through LLMs to agents.

As their applications extend to increasingly complex scenarios, however, LLMs continue to face challenges in tasks that require deep reasoning and logical inference. In particular, models trained on large scale textual corpora may incorporate noisy or irrelevant information during generation, which can lead to incorrect predictions or outputs that are inconsistent with factual knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose a stepwise reasoning enhancement framework for LLMs based on external subgraph generation, termed SGR. The proposed framework dynamically constructs query relevant subgraphs from external knowledge bases and leverages their semantic structure to guide the reasoning process. By performing reasoning in a step by step manner over structured subgraphs, SGR reduces the influence of noisy information and improves reasoning accuracy. Specifically, the framework first generates an external subgraph tailored to the input query, then guides the model to conduct multi step reasoning grounded in the subgraph, and finally integrates multiple reasoning paths to produce the final answer. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SGR consistently outperforms strong baselines, indicating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5916\u90e8\u5b50\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5206\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6SGR\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u5b50\u56fe\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5176\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u566a\u58f0\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSGR\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e38\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u65e0\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u9519\u8bef\u9884\u6d4b\u6216\u4e0e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0d\u7b26\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u673a\u5236\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSGR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u6839\u636e\u8f93\u5165\u67e5\u8be2\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u5173\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u5b50\u56fe\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b50\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\uff1b3\uff09\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6761\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u5f97\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "result": "SGR\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SGR\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u5b50\u56fe\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5206\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d7\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

The growing complexity of LLMs, multimodal architectures, and recommendation systems, combined with techniques like sparsity and quantization, creates significant computational challenges. Moreover, frequent hardware updates and diverse chip architectures further complicate this landscape, requiring tailored kernel implementations for each platform. However, manual optimization cannot keep pace with these demands, creating a critical bottleneck in AI system development. Recent advances in LLM code generation capabilities have opened new possibilities for automating kernel development. In this work, we propose AKG kernel agent (AI-driven Kernel Generator), a multi-agent system that automates kernel generation, migration, and performance tuning. AKG kernel agent is designed to support multiple domain-specific languages (DSLs), including Triton, TileLang, CPP, and CUDA-C, enabling it to target different hardware backends while maintaining correctness and portability. The system's modular design allows rapid integration of new DSLs and hardware targets.

First, a cross-model attention mechanism enables successor models to access and fuse hidden states from predecessors, facilitating hierarchical error correction and knowledge transfer. Second, a chain training paradigm progressively fine-tunes connected models with an error-suppression objective, ensuring that each model rectifies the mispredictions of its predecessor with minimal additional computation. Third, a near-parallel inference paradigm design pipelines hidden states across models layer by layer, achieving inference efficiency approaching single-model decoding. We further establish the theoretical foundations of LLMBoost, proving that sequential integration guarantees monotonic improvements under bounded correction assumptions. Extensive experiments on commonsense reasoning and arithmetic reasoning tasks demonstrate that LLMBoost consistently boosts accuracy while reducing inference latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMBoost \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u9ed1\u7bb1\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u540e\u7eed\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u878d\u5408\u524d\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7ea0\u9519\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\uff1b\u94fe\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bef\u5dee\u6291\u5236\u76ee\u6807\u9010\u4e2a\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u5373\u53ef\u4fee\u6b63\u524d\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u8fd1\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6309\u5c42\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5904\u7406\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7ea0\u6b63\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u987a\u5e8f\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u5355\u8c03\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7b97\u672f\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c06LLM\u89c6\u4e3a\u9ed1\u7bb1\uff0c\u4ec5\u7ec4\u5408\u8f93\u5165\u6216\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8868\u793a\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u534f\u4f5c\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u663e\u5f0f\u6316\u6398\u548c\u5229\u7528\u4e2d\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLLMBoost\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\uff1a1\uff09\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u540e\u7eed\u6a21\u578b\u8bbf\u95ee\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u524d\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\uff1b2\uff09\u94fe\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bef\u5dee\u6291\u5236\u76ee\u6807\u9010\u6b65\u5fae\u8c03\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7ea0\u9519\uff1b3\uff09\u8fd1\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5206\u5c42\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4f20\u9012\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u90e8\u5206\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u5408\u7406\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u5e8f\u5217\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u5e26\u6765\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7b97\u672f\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cLLMBoost\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMBoost\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5229\u7528\u4e2d\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, autoregressive models often suffer from performance degradation under repeated data exposure, where overfitting leads to a marked decline in model capability. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to an imbalance in learning dynamics: predictable, low-entropy tokens are learned quickly and come to dominate optimization, while the model's ability to generalize on high-entropy tokens deteriorates with continued training. To address this, we introduce EntroDrop, an entropy-guided token dropout method that functions as structured data regularization. EntroDrop selectively masks low-entropy tokens during training and employs a curriculum schedule to adjust regularization strength in alignment with training progress. Experiments across model scales from 0.6B to 8B parameters show that EntroDrop consistently outperforms standard regularization baselines and maintains robust performance throughout extended multi-epoch training. These findings underscore the importance of aligning regularization with token-level learning dynamics when training on limited data.

Current event camera calibration methods typically involve using flashing patterns, reconstructing intensity images, and utilizing the features extracted from events. Existing methods are generally time-consuming and require manually placed calibration objects, which cannot meet the needs of rapidly changing scenarios. In this paper, we propose a line-based event camera calibration framework exploiting the geometric lines of commonly-encountered objects in man-made environments, e.g., doors, windows, boxes, etc. Different from previous methods, our method detects lines directly from event streams and leverages an event-line calibration model to generate the initial guess of camera parameters, which is suitable for both planar and non-planar lines. Then, a non-linear optimization is adopted to refine camera parameters. Both simulation and real-world experiments have demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of our method, with validation performed on monocular and stereo event cameras.

Despite the encouraging results, RL improvement inevitably relies on sampling successful, high-quality responses; however, the initial model often struggles to generate responses that satisfy all constraints due to its limited capabilities, yielding sparse or indistinguishable rewards that impede learning. In this work, we propose Hindsight instruction Replay (HiR), a novel sample-efficient RL framework for complex instruction following tasks, which employs a select-then-rewrite strategy to replay failed attempts as successes based on the constraints that have been satisfied in hindsight. We perform RL on these replayed samples as well as the original ones, theoretically framing the objective as dual-preference learning at both the instruction- and response-level to enable efficient optimization using only a binary reward signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed HiR yields promising results across different instruction following tasks, while requiring less computational budget.

We study online learning of a one-dimensional threshold policy from bandit feedback under demographic parity (DP) and, optionally, service-rate constraints. The learner observes only a scalar score each round and selects a threshold; reward and constraint residuals are revealed only for the chosen threshold.\n  We propose Optimistic Feasible Search (OFS), a simple grid-based method that maintains confidence bounds for reward and constraint residuals for each candidate threshold. At each round, OFS selects a threshold that appears feasible under confidence bounds and, among those, maximizes optimistic reward; if no threshold appears feasible, OFS selects the threshold minimizing optimistic constraint violation. This design directly targets feasible high-utility thresholds and is particularly effective for low-dimensional, interpretable policy classes where discretization is natural.\n  We evaluate OFS on (i) a synthetic closed-loop benchmark with stable contraction dynamics and (ii) two semi-synthetic closed-loop benchmarks grounded in German Credit and COMPAS, constructed by training a score model and feeding group-dependent acceptance decisions back into population composition. Across all environments, OFS achieves higher reward with smaller cumulative constraint violation than unconstrained and primal-dual bandit baselines, and is near-oracle relative to the best feasible fixed threshold under the same sweep procedure.

However, prior findings remain inconsistent, and most studies operationalize diversity in aggregate terms, overlooking internal role differentiation. This limitation obscures a more nuanced understanding of how gender diversity shapes team impact. In particular, the effect of gender diversity across different team roles remains poorly understood. To this end, we define a scientific team as all coauthors of a paper and measure team impact through five-year citation counts. Using author contribution statements, we classified members into leadership and support roles. Drawing on more than 130,000 papers from PLOS journals, most of which are in biomedical-related disciplines, we employed multivariable regression to examine the association between gender diversity in these roles and team impact. Furthermore, we apply a threshold regression model to investigate how team size moderates this relationship. The results show that (1) the relationship between gender diversity and team impact follows an inverted U-shape for both leadership and support groups; (2) teams with an all-female leadership group and an all-male support group achieve higher impact than other team types. Interestingly, (3) the effect of leadership-group gender diversity is significantly negative for small teams but becomes positive and statistically insignificant in large teams. In contrast, the estimates for support-group gender diversity remain significant and positive, regardless of team size.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u56e2\u961f\u4e2d\u6027\u522b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u56e2\u961f\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8d85\u8fc713\u4e07\u7bc7\u6765\u81eaPLOS\u671f\u520a\u7684\u8bba\u6587\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c06\u4f5c\u8005\u5206\u4e3a\u9886\u5bfc\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6027\u522b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u56e2\u961f\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u5448\u5012U\u578b\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9886\u5bfc\u7ec4\u5168\u4e3a\u5973\u6027\u3001\u652f\u6301\u7ec4\u5168\u4e3a\u7537\u6027\u65f6\uff0c\u56e2\u961f\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u6700\u9ad8\u3002\u5c0f\u56e2\u961f\u4e2d\u9886\u5bfc\u7ec4\u6027\u522b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5927\u56e2\u961f\u4e2d\u5219\u8f6c\u4e3a\u6b63\u5411\u4f46\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u800c\u652f\u6301\u7ec4\u6027\u522b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u65e0\u8bba\u56e2\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u5c0f\u5747\u5448\u663e\u8457\u6b63\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u4e8e\u6027\u522b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u79d1\u5b66\u56e2\u961f\u6210\u529f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7ed3\u8bba\u4e0d\u4e00\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u6570\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u6574\u4f53\u591a\u6837\u6027\u8861\u91cf\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u56e2\u961f\u5185\u90e8\u89d2\u8272\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u5730\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u89d2\u8272\u4e2d\u6027\u522b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f5c\u8005\u8d21\u732e\u58f0\u660e\uff0c\u5c06\u56e2\u961f\u6210\u5458\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u9886\u5bfc\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8d85\u8fc713\u4e07\u7bc7PLOS\u671f\u520a\u8bba\u6587\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u6027\u522b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u4e94\u5e74\u4eba\u5747\u5f15\u7528\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u9608\u503c\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u8003\u5bdf\u56e2\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\uff081\uff09\u9886\u5bfc\u7ec4\u4e0e\u652f\u6301\u7ec4\u7684\u6027\u522b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u56e2\u961f\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u5747\u5448\u5012U\u578b\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u5168\u5973\u6027\u9886\u5bfc\u7ec4+\u5168\u7537\u6027\u652f\u6301\u7ec4\u7684\u56e2\u961f\u5177\u6709\u6700\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u9886\u5bfc\u7ec4\u6027\u522b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5728\u5c0f\u56e2\u961f\u4e2d\u4e3a\u8d1f\uff0c\u5927\u56e2\u961f\u4e2d\u8f6c\u4e3a\u6b63\u4f46\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u7ec4\u6027\u522b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u59cb\u7ec8\u663e\u8457\u4e3a\u6b63\uff0c\u4e0d\u53d7\u56e2\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6027\u522b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u79d1\u5b66\u56e2\u961f\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u975e\u5355\u4e00\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5176\u6548\u5e94\u53d7\u89d2\u8272\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u56e2\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u5171\u540c\u8c03\u8282\u3002\u4f18\u5316\u56e2\u961f\u4e2d\u9886\u5bfc\u4e0e\u652f\u6301\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u6027\u522b\u6784\u6210\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u79d1\u7814\u4ea7\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u3002"}}

We identify a fundamental limitation: these variances are relation-agnostic, meaning an entity receives identical uncertainty regardless of relational context. This conflates two distinct out-of-distribution phenomena that behave oppositely: emerging entities (rare, poorly-learned) and novel relational contexts (familiar entities in unobserved relationships). We prove an impossibility result: any uncertainty estimator using only entity-level statistics independent of relation context achieves near-random OOD detection on novel contexts. We empirically validate this on three datasets, finding 100 percent of novel-context triples have frequency-matched in-distribution counterparts. This explains why existing probabilistic methods achieve 0.99 AUROC on random corruptions but only 0.52-0.64 on temporal distribution shift. We formalize uncertainty decomposition into complementary components: semantic uncertainty from entity embedding variance (detecting emerging entities) and structural uncertainty from entity-relation co-occurrence (detecting novel contexts). Our main theoretical result proves these signals are non-redundant, and that any convex combination strictly dominates either signal alone. Our method (CAGP) combines semantic and structural uncertainty via learned weights, achieving 0.94-0.99 AUROC on temporal OOD detection across multiple benchmarks, a 60-80 percent relative improvement over relation-agnostic baselines. Empirical validation confirms complete frequency overlap on three datasets (FB15k-237, WN18RR, YAGO3-10).

This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of SAM 3D, a general-purpose image-to-3D foundation model, for monocular remote sensing building reconstruction. We benchmark SAM 3D against TRELLIS on samples from the NYC Urban Dataset, employing Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and CLIP-based Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) as evaluation metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that SAM 3D produces more coherent roof geometry and sharper boundaries compared to TRELLIS. We further extend SAM 3D to urban scene reconstruction through a segment-reconstruct-compose pipeline, demonstrating its potential for urban scene modeling. We also analyze practical limitations and discuss future research directions. These findings provide practical guidance for deploying foundation models in urban 3D reconstruction and motivate future integration of scene-level structural priors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86SAM 3D\u8fd9\u4e00\u901a\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u52303D\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5355\u76ee\u9065\u611f\u5efa\u7b51\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8eTRELLIS\u5728\u7ebd\u7ea6\u57ce\u5e02\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5c4b\u9876\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u66f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6bb5-\u91cd\u5efa-\u7ec4\u5408\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u62d3\u5c55\u81f3\u57ce\u5e02\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u76ee\u9065\u611f\u5efa\u7b51\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5927\u91cf\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528SAM 3D\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eNYC Urban Dataset\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528FID\u4e0eCMMD\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u6bb5-\u91cd\u5efa-\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b0\u57ce\u5e02\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "SAM 3D\u5728\u5c4b\u9876\u51e0\u4f55\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8eTRELLIS\uff1b\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u57ce\u5e02\u7ea7\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "conclusion": "SAM 3D\u5728\u5355\u76ee\u9065\u611f\u5efa\u7b51\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u90e8\u7f72\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u672a\u6765\u878d\u5408\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, LLMs are fundamentally limited by the ``Artificial Hivemind'' effect, where they generate similar responses within the same model and produce homogeneous outputs across different models. As a consequence, students may be exposed to overly similar and repetitive LLM-generated problems, which harms diversity of thought. Drawing inspiration from Wallas's theory of creativity and Guilford's framework of divergent-convergent thinking, we propose CreativeDC, a two-phase prompting method that explicitly scaffolds the LLM's reasoning into distinct phases. By decoupling creative exploration from constraint satisfaction, our method enables LLMs to explore a broader space of ideas before committing to a final problem. We evaluate CreativeDC for creative problem generation using a comprehensive set of metrics that capture diversity, novelty, and utility. The results show that CreativeDC achieves significantly higher diversity and novelty compared to baselines while maintaining high utility.

This paper addresses a critical gap by integrating Global M2 Liquidity, aggregated from 18 major economies, as a leading exogenous variable with a 12-week lag structure. Using the TimeXer architecture, we compare a liquidity-conditioned forecasting model (TimeXer-Exog) against state-of-the-art benchmarks including LSTM, N-BEATS, PatchTST, and a standard univariate TimeXer. Experiments conducted on daily Bitcoin price data from January 2020 to August 2025 demonstrate that explicit macroeconomic conditioning significantly stabilizes long-horizon forecasts. At a 70-day forecast horizon, the proposed TimeXer-Exog model achieves a mean squared error (MSE) 1.08e8, outperforming the univariate TimeXer baseline by over 89 percent.

Indeed, the assets at these substations (e.g., transformers) are prone to disruption from many hazards, including hurricanes, flooding, earthquakes, and geomagnetically induced currents (GICs). As electrical grids are considered critical national infrastructure, any failure can have significant economic and public safety implications. To help prevent and mitigate these failures, it is thus essential that we identify key substation components to quantify vulnerability. Unfortunately, traditional manual mapping of substation infrastructure is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, an autonomous solution utilizing computer vision models is preferable, as it allows for greater convenience and efficiency. In this research paper, we train and compare the outputs of 3 models (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, RF-DETR) on a manually labeled dataset of US substation images. Each model is evaluated for detection accuracy, precision, and efficiency.

While LLM-embeddings are frequently used to store and retrieve text by semantic similarity in vector databases, the global structure semantic relationships in text corpora often remains opaque. Herein we propose a nested density clustering approach, to infer hierarchical trees of semantically related texts. The method starts by identifying texts of strong semantic similarity as it searches for dense clusters in LLM embedding space. As the density criterion is gradually relaxed, these dense clusters merge into more diffuse clusters, until the whole dataset is represented by a single cluster - the root of the tree. By embedding dense clusters into increasingly diffuse ones, we construct a tree structure that captures hierarchical semantic relationships among texts. We outline how this approach can be used to classify textual data for abstracts of scientific abstracts as a case study. This enables the data-driven discovery research areas and their subfields without predefined categories. To evaluate the general applicability of the method, we further apply it to established benchmark datasets such as the 20 News- groups and IMDB 50k Movie Reviews, demonstrating its robustness across domains.

Pose-code-based frameworks such as CoMo map quantifiable pose attributes into discrete pose codes that support interpretable motion control, but their frame-wise representation struggles to capture subtle temporal dynamics and high-frequency details, often degrading reconstruction fidelity and local controllability. To address this limitation, we introduce pose-guided residual refinement for motion (PGR$^2$M), a hybrid representation that augments interpretable pose codes with residual codes learned via residual vector quantization (RVQ). A pose-guided RVQ tokenizer decomposes motion into pose latents that encode coarse global structure and residual latents that model fine-grained temporal variations. Residual dropout further discourages over-reliance on residuals, preserving the semantic alignment and editability of the pose codes. On top of this tokenizer, a base Transformer autoregressively predicts pose codes from text, and a refine Transformer predicts residual codes conditioned on text, pose codes, and quantization stage. Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show that PGR$^2$M improves Fr\u00e9chet inception distance and reconstruction metrics for both generation and editing compared with CoMo and recent diffusion- and tokenization-based baselines, while user studies confirm that it enables intuitive, structure-preserving motion edits.", "AI": {"tldr": "PGR$^2$M\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u59ff\u52bf\u7801\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u6b8b\u5dee\u7801\u6765\u589e\u5f3a3D\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u59ff\u6001\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\uff08RVQ\uff09\u5c06\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u59ff\u52bf\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u4e22\u5f03\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2aTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u522b\u9884\u6d4b\u59ff\u52bf\u7801\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u7801\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u5230\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u3002\u5728HumanML3D\u548cKIT-ML\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPGR$^2$M\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eCoMo\u53ca\u8fd1\u671f\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u4e5f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u76f4\u89c2\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u59ff\u52bf\u7801\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5982CoMo\u867d\u7136\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5e27\u7ea7\u8868\u793a\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u53c8\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u59ff\u6001\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u7ec6\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08PGR$^2$M\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6b8b\u5dee\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\uff08RVQ\uff09\u5c06\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\uff1a\u7531\u59ff\u6001\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7684\u59ff\u52bf\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u8868\u793a\u7c97\u7565\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5efa\u6a21\u7cbe\u7ec6\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2aTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u2014\u2014\u57fa\u7840Transformer\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9884\u6d4b\u59ff\u52bf\u7801\uff0c\u7cbe\u70bcTransformer\u5728\u6587\u672c\u3001\u59ff\u52bf\u7801\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u9884\u6d4b\u6b8b\u5dee\u7801\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u6b8b\u5dee\u4e22\u5f03\u7b56\u7565\u9632\u6b62\u5bf9\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728HumanML3D\u548cKIT-ML\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cPGR$^2$M\u5728\u5f17\u96f7\u6b47\u8d77\u59cb\u8ddd\u79bb\uff08FID\uff09\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u6307\u6807\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eCoMo\u53ca\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5206\u8bcd\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f4\u89c2\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "conclusion": "PGR$^2$M\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u59ff\u6001\u7801\u4e0e\u6b8b\u5dee\u7801\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a83D\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7ec6\u8282\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u4e0e\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u8fc8\u5411\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

Assaad"], "title": "Regret-Based Federated Causal Discovery with Unknown Interventions", "comment": null, "summary": "Most causal discovery methods recover a completed partially directed acyclic graph representing a Markov equivalence class from observational data. Recent work has extended these methods to federated settings to address data decentralization and privacy constraints, but often under idealized assumptions that all clients share the same causal model. Such assumptions are unrealistic in practice, as client-specific policies or protocols, for example, across hospitals, naturally induce heterogeneous and unknown interventions. In this work, we address federated causal discovery under unknown client-level interventions. We propose I-PERI, a novel federated algorithm that first recovers the CPDAG of the union of client graphs and then orients additional edges by exploiting structural differences induced by interventions across clients. This yields a tighter equivalence class, which we call the $\\mathbf\u03a6$-Markov Equivalence Class, represented by the $\\mathbf\u03a6$-CPDAG. We provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of I-PERI, as well as on its privacy-preserving properties, and present empirical evaluations on synthetic data demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b97\u6cd5I-PERI\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5b58\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9996\u5148\u6062\u590d\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u56fe\u7684\u5e76\u96c6\u7684CPDAG\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u95f4\u56e0\u5e72\u9884\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u6765\u5b9a\u5411\u66f4\u591a\u8fb9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f97\u5230\u66f4\u7d27\u81f4\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u7c7b\uff08\u5373\u03a6-CPDAG\uff09\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u5177\u5907\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5171\u4eab\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u533b\u9662\u7b49\u673a\u6784\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u653f\u7b56\u6216\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u6b64\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u672a\u77e5\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7ea7\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faI-PERI\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u90a6\u65b9\u5f0f\u6062\u590d\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u56fe\u5e76\u96c6\u7684CPDAG\uff0c\u518d\u5229\u7528\u5e72\u9884\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u8fdb\u884c\u989d\u5916\u8fb9\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u03a6-CPDAG\u4ee5\u8868\u793a\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u03a6-\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7b49\u4ef7\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cI-PERI\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u7d27\u81f4\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u7c7b\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5177\u6709\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "I-PERI\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u672a\u77e5\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5e72\u9884\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recent works on neural network parameterisations, such as $\u03bc$P, have enabled transfer of optimal global hyperparameters across model sizes. These works propose an empirical practice of search for optimal global base hyperparameters at a small model size, and transfer to a large size. We extend these works in two key ways. To handle scaling along most important scaling axes, we propose the Complete$^{(d)}$ Parameterisation that unifies scaling in width and depth -- using an adaptation of CompleteP -- as well as in batch-size and training duration. Secondly, with our parameterisation, we investigate per-module hyperparameter optimisation and transfer. We characterise the empirical challenges of navigating the high-dimensional hyperparameter landscape, and propose practical guidelines for tackling this optimisation problem. We demonstrate that, with the right parameterisation, hyperparameter transfer holds even in the per-module hyperparameter regime. Our study covers an extensive range of optimisation hyperparameters of modern models: learning rates, AdamW parameters, weight decay, initialisation scales, and residual block multipliers. Our experiments demonstrate significant training speed improvements in Large Language Models with the transferred per-module hyperparameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5Complete$^{(d)}$\uff0c\u53ef\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u5bbd\u5ea6\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u957f\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u6a21\u5757\u7ea7\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u5c3a\u5bf8\u8fc1\u79fb\u6700\u4f18\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u7f29\u653e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u5757\u7ea7\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faComplete$^{(d)}$\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u5bbd\u5ea6\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u957f\u7684\u7f29\u653e\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u7ea7\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u641c\u7d22\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u540e\uff0c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8fc1\u79fb\u5728\u6a21\u5757\u7ea7\u522b\u4f9d\u7136\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f7f\u5f97\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8fc1\u79fb\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7136\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, significant challenges are posed by the fast, uneven propagation of shock waves and unstable testing conditions. To address these challenges, a novel framework is proposed that utilizes multiple event cameras to estimate the asymmetry of shock waves, leveraging its high-speed and high-dynamic range capabilities. Initially, a polar coordinate system is established, which encodes events to reveal shock wave propagation patterns, with adaptive region-of-interest (ROI) extraction through event offset calculations. Subsequently, shock wave front events are extracted using iterative slope analysis, exploiting the continuity of velocity changes. Finally, the geometric model of events and shock wave motion parameters is derived according to event-based optical imaging model, along with the 3D reconstruction model. Through the above process, multi-angle shock wave measurement, motion field reconstruction, and explosive equivalence inversion are achieved. The results of the speed measurement are compared with those of the pressure sensors and the empirical formula, revealing a maximum error of 5.20% and a minimum error of 0.06%. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-precision measurement of the shock wave motion field with both high spatial and temporal resolution, representing significant progress.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u51b2\u51fb\u6ce2\u8fd0\u52a8\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6781\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u7f16\u7801\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u659c\u7387\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u51b2\u51fb\u6ce2\u524d\u7f18\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b8c\u6210\u591a\u89d2\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u573a\u91cd\u6784\u53ca\u7206\u70b8\u5f53\u91cf\u53cd\u6f14\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bef\u5dee\u57280.06%\u81f35.20%\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u65f6\u7a7a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u5bf9\u975e\u5747\u5300\u5feb\u901f\u4f20\u64ad\u51b2\u51fb\u6ce2\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u51b2\u51fb\u6ce2\u8fd0\u52a8\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u5bf9\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0e\u635f\u4f24\u8bc4\u4f30\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u4f20\u64ad\u53ca\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u73af\u5883\u5e26\u6765\u5de8\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u9ad8\u65f6\u7a7a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6781\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u7f16\u7801\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e8b\u4ef6\u504f\u79fb\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\u63d0\u53d6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u659c\u7387\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u53d6\u51b2\u51fb\u6ce2\u524d\u7f18\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51e0\u4f55\u5173\u7cfb\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u89d2\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u573a\u91cd\u6784\u4e0e\u7206\u70b8\u5f53\u91cf\u53cd\u6f14\u3002", "result": "\u901f\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0e\u538b\u529b\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u53ca\u7ecf\u9a8c\u516c\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a5.20%\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a0.06%\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u65f6\u7a7a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u51b2\u51fb\u6ce2\u8fd0\u52a8\u573a\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0e\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u9ad8\u901f\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0e\u9ad8\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u51b2\u51fb\u6ce2\u975e\u5747\u5300\u5feb\u901f\u4f20\u64ad\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9ad8\u65f6\u7a7a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u591a\u89d2\u5ea6\u51b2\u51fb\u6ce2\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0e\u635f\u4f24\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

Building upon this core component, we propose a two-stage paradigm for knowledge distillation and transfer: (1) Prior-Guided Knowledge Distillation, where we use our MoE adapter and 10% of available fully supervised data to distill SAM into an expert teacher (Scalpel-SAM); and (2) Deployment-Oriented Knowledge Transfer, where we use Scalpel-SAM to generate pseudo labels for training lightweight and efficient downstream models. Experiments demonstrate that with minimal annotations, our paradigm enables downstream models to achieve performance comparable to, or even surpassing, their fully supervised counterparts.

Existing post-hoc residual correction methods attempt to fix these errors, but are inherently greedy: although they may improve average accuracy, they can also \"help in the wrong way\" by overcorrecting reliable predictions and causing local failures in unseen scenarios.\n  To address this critical \"safety gap,\" we propose CRC (Causality-inspired Safe Residual Correction), a plug-and-play framework explicitly designed to ensure non-degradation. CRC follows a divide-and-conquer philosophy: it employs a causality-inspired encoder to expose direction-aware structure by decoupling self- and cross-variable dynamics, and a hybrid corrector to model residual errors. Crucially, the correction process is governed by a strict four-fold safety mechanism that prevents harmful updates.\n  Experiments across multiple datasets and forecasting backbones show that CRC consistently improves accuracy, while an in-depth ablation study confirms that its core safety mechanisms ensure exceptionally high non-degradation rates (NDR), making CRC a correction framework suited for safe and reliable deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCRC\uff08\u56e0\u679c\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6b8b\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u4ee3\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002CRC\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u542f\u53d1\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5206\u79bb\u81ea\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0e\u8de8\u53d8\u91cf\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6821\u6b63\u5668\u5efa\u6a21\u6b8b\u5dee\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u56db\u91cd\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u786e\u4fdd\u6821\u6b63\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u6709\u5bb3\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCRC\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u975e\u9000\u5316\u7387\uff08NDR\uff09\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6b8b\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6821\u6b63\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u6d4b\u800c\u5f15\u53d1\u672a\u77e5\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u9000\u5316\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6821\u6b63\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCRC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56e0\u679c\u542f\u53d1\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ee5\u89e3\u8026\u81ea\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0e\u8de8\u53d8\u91cf\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6821\u6b63\u5668\u5efa\u6a21\u6b8b\u5dee\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56db\u91cd\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u4e25\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u6821\u6b63\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u6709\u5bb3\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "CRC\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u975e\u9000\u5316\u7387\uff08NDR\uff09\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u969c\u90e8\u7f72\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CRC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6b8b\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u90e8\u7f72\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

When a prompt implies a preferred answer, models often reinforce that bias rather than explore alternatives. This phenomenon remains underexplored, yet it is already harmful in base models and poses an even greater risk in multi-agent debate, where echo chambers reinforce bias instead of correction. We introduce Mixture of Latent Concept Experts (MoLaCE), a lightweight inference-time framework that addresses confirmation bias by mixing experts instantiated as different activation strengths over latent concepts that shape model responses. Our key insight is that, due to the compositional nature of language, differently phrased prompts reweight latent concepts in prompt-specific ways that affect factual correctness, so no single fixed intervention can be applied universally across inputs. This design enables a single LLM to emulate the benefits of debate internally while remaining computationally efficient and scalable. It can also be integrated into multi-agent debate frameworks to diversify perspectives and reduce correlated errors. We empirically show that it consistently reduces confirmation bias, improves robustness, and matches or surpasses multi-agent debate while requiring only a fraction of the computation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMoLaCE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u4e13\u5bb6\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u786e\u8ba4\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6982\u5ff5\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u90e8\u8fa9\u8bba\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u6697\u793a\u504f\u597d\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u786e\u8ba4\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5f62\u6210\u56de\u97f3\u5ba4\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u52a0\u5267\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u666e\u904d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1Mixture of Latent Concept Experts\uff08MoLaCE\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u5185\u5bb9\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u4e0d\u540c\u6f5c\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u6982\u5ff5\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u90e8\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMoLaCE\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u964d\u4f4e\u786e\u8ba4\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ec5\u9700\u6781\u5c0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "MoLaCE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u786e\u8ba4\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u5185\u90e8\u8fa9\u8bba\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u9ad8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

To support more reliable future benchmarking, one of these datasets has been manually curated and enhanced and is released as a secondary outcome of this work. Compared to standard self-detection methods and SelfCheckGPT, a state-of-the-art approach, our method achieves up to 16% relative improvement in accuracy and 20% in F1-score. Our results show that LLMs can better analyse atomic facts when they are structured as knowledge graphs, even when initial outputs contain inaccuracies. This low-cost, model-agnostic approach paves the way toward safer and more trustworthy language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u81ea\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8f93\u51fa\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e0e\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728GPT-4o\u548cGemini-2.5-Flash\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u68c0\u6d4b\u548cSelfCheckGPT\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe16%\uff0cF1-score\u63d0\u534720%\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ecf\u4eba\u5de5\u6821\u51c6\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u672a\u6765\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u4e25\u91cd\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u5982\u4f55\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u4e2d\u7684\u865a\u5047\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff0c\u662f\u63d0\u5347LLM\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5c06LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u6790\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e0e\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f30\u8ba1\u56de\u7b54\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41LLM\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u81ea\u68c0\u6d4b\u548cSelfCheckGPT\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534716%\uff0c\u5728F1-score\u4e0a\u63d0\u534720%\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u539f\u5b50\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u539f\u59cb\u8f93\u51fa\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u81ea\u68c0\u6d4b\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

The audit shows that most physical models are fragile at this temporal resolution; PPML gravity is the strongest physical baseline, while constrained variants improve when calibrated on full OD margins but remain notably weaker. We then build residual learners on top of physical baselines using gradient-boosted trees and SHAP analysis, demonstrating that (i) physics-grounded residuals approach the accuracy of a strong tree-based predictor while retaining interpretable structure, and (ii) POI-anchored residuals are consistently competitive and most robust under spatial generalization.

However, it has been observed that LVLMs, after tuning to visual instruction using commonly used training datasets, often fail to exhibit the instruction-following ability that was present in the LLM before integration, leading to results in which they do not follow task instructions as expected. This study quantitatively demonstrates that LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning and analyzes its underlying causes. In particular, we constructed new training datasets highlighting whether the output format is specified. Then, we investigated how explicitly indicating the output format during fine-tuning affects LVLMs' instruction-following ability. Our quantitative evaluation confirmed that LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning with commonly used datasets. Furthermore, we found that LVLMs trained with datasets, including instructions on output format, tend to follow instructions more accurately than models that do not.

We evaluate three proprietary and two open-source SLMs, demonstrating that none of these models can maintain a consistent speaking style when instructed to do so. We further show that when SLMs are asked to recall the style instruction in later turns, they can recall the style instruction, but they fail to express it throughout the conversation. We also show that explicitly asking the model to recall the style instruction can partially mitigate style amnesia. In addition, we examine various prompting strategies and find that SLMs struggle to follow the required style when the instruction is placed in system messages rather than user messages, which contradicts the intended function of system prompts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLMs\uff09\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7279\u5b9a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51e0\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u540e\u65e0\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u7ef4\u6301\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u8bed\u8c03\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u3001\u53e3\u97f3\u3001\u97f3\u91cf\u548c\u8bed\u901f\u7b49\u526f\u8bed\u8a00\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\u2018\u98ce\u683c\u9057\u5fd8\u2019\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u56de\u5fc6\u8d77\u98ce\u683c\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u540e\u7eed\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u4f53\u73b0\u51fa\u6765\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u591a\u4e2a\u4e13\u6709\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u65e0\u8bba\u91c7\u7528\u4f55\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5f53\u6307\u4ee4\u7f6e\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d88\u606f\u800c\u975e\u7528\u6237\u6d88\u606f\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7ef4\u6301\u6307\u5b9a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u4e13\u6709\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u5f00\u6e90\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u5bf9\u60c5\u7eea\u3001\u53e3\u97f3\u3001\u97f3\u91cf\u548c\u8bed\u901f\u7b49\u526f\u8bed\u8a00\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u7ef4\u6301\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u98ce\u683c\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u56de\u5fc6\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u98ce\u683c\u9057\u5fd8\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u80fd\u56de\u5fc6\u8d77\u6307\u4ee4\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u8868\u8fbe\uff1b\u5c06\u98ce\u683c\u6307\u4ee4\u7f6e\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u6d88\u606f\u4e2d\u6bd4\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d88\u606f\u4e2d\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff1b\u663e\u5f0f\u8981\u6c42\u6a21\u578b\u56de\u987e\u6307\u4ee4\u53ef\u90e8\u5206\u7f13\u89e3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u8bf4\u8bdd\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u81f4\u98ce\u683c\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u98ce\u683c\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

This model is simple but effective by integrating the density factor and the confidence factor, this study designs a noise-resistant weight update mechanism and a dynamic sampling strategy. Rather than functioning as independent components, these modules are tightly integrated to orchestrate weight updates, sample region partitioning, and region-guided sampling. Thus, this study achieves the collaborative optimization of imbalanced learning and model training. Extensive experiments on 20 public imbalanced datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art baselines.

Generally, con- sumers use overly descriptive and peripheral information to express their medical condition or other healthcare needs, contributing to the challenges of natural language understanding. One way to address this challenge is to summarize the questions and distill the key information of the original question. Recently, large-scale datasets have significantly propelled the development of several summarization tasks, such as multi-document summarization and dialogue summarization. However, a lack of a domain-expert annotated dataset for the consumer healthcare questions summarization task inhibits the development of an efficient summarization system. To address this issue, we introduce a new dataset, CHQ-Sum,m that contains 1507 domain-expert annotated consumer health questions and corresponding summaries. The dataset is derived from the community question answering forum and therefore provides a valuable resource for understanding consumer health-related posts on social media.

While significant efforts have been made to detect and mitigate such hallucinations, predicting whether an LLM's response is correct remains a critical yet underexplored problem. This study investigates the feasibility of predicting correctness by analyzing a general-purpose model (GPT-4o) and a reasoning-centric model (OSS-120B) on a multiple-choice prosthodontics exam. We utilize metadata and hallucination signals across three distinct prompting strategies to build a correctness predictor for each (model, prompting) pair. Our findings demonstrate that this metadata-based approach can improve accuracy by up to +7.14% and achieve a precision of 83.12% over a baseline that assumes all answers are correct. We further show that while actual hallucination is a strong indicator of incorrectness, metadata signals alone are not reliable predictors of hallucination. Finally, we reveal that prompting strategies, despite not affecting overall accuracy, significantly alter the models' internal behaviors and the predictive utility of their metadata. These results present a promising direction for developing reliability signals in LLMs but also highlight that the methods explored in this paper are not yet robust enough for critical, high-stakes deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u56de\u7b54\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9GPT-4o\u548cOSS-120B\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u7259\u79d1\u4fee\u590d\u5b66\u591a\u9009\u9898\u8003\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u5143\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5c06\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe7.14%\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523083.12%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709\u7b54\u6848\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e7b\u89c9\u662f\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5f3a\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u5143\u6570\u636e\u672c\u8eab\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u6d4b\u5e7b\u89c9\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u867d\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5374\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7528\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u524d\u666f\u4e50\u89c2\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\uff08\u5373\u5e7b\u89c9\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u524d\u9884\u6d4b\u56de\u7b54\u662f\u5426\u6b63\u786e\u4ecd\u662f\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7259\u79d1\u4fee\u590d\u5b66\u591a\u9009\u9898\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9GPT-4o\u548cOSS-120B\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u5143\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5e7b\u89c9\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9488\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\uff08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\uff09\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4f7f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe7.14%\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u8fbe83.12%\uff1b\u5b9e\u9645\u5e7b\u89c9\u662f\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u826f\u597d\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u5143\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u6d4b\u5e7b\u89c9\uff1b\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u867d\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c1a\u672a\u8db3\u591f\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Existing methods employ the Jaccard similarity coefficient instead of the cosine distance to enhance the measurement accuracy. However, these methods introduce too many irrelevant nodes, producing Jaccard coefficients with limited discriminative power and adversely affecting clustering performance. To address this issue, we propose a prediction-driven Top-K Jaccard similarity coefficient that enhances the purity of neighboring nodes, thereby improving the reliability of similarity measurements. Nevertheless, accurately predicting the optimal number of neighbors (Top-K) remains challenging, leading to suboptimal clustering results. To overcome this limitation, we develop a Transformer-based prediction model that examines the relationships between the central node and its neighboring nodes near the Top-K to further enhance the reliability of similarity estimation. However, vanilla Transformer, when applied to predict relationships between nodes, often introduces noise due to their overemphasis on irrelevant feature relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a Sparse Differential Transformer (SDT), instead of the vanilla Transformer, to eliminate noise and enhance the model's anti-noise capabilities. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, such as MS-Celeb-1M, demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, outperforming existing methods and providing a more robust solution for face clustering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684Top-K\u6770\u5361\u5fb7\u76f8\u4f3c\u7cfb\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7a00\u758f\u5dee\u5206Transformer\uff08SDT\uff09\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u4eba\u8138\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u90bb\u5c45\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u65e0\u5173\u8282\u70b9\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728MS-Celeb-1M\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\uff08SOTA\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u6770\u5361\u5fb7\u76f8\u4f3c\u7cfb\u6570\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5f15\u5165\u8fc7\u591a\u65e0\u5173\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u805a\u7c7b\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u6700\u4f73\u90bb\u5c45\u6570\u91cf\uff08Top-K\uff09\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684Top-K\u6770\u5361\u5fb7\u76f8\u4f3c\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u91c7\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u5dee\u5206Transformer\uff08SDT\uff09\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u6297\u566a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5982MS-Celeb-1M\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165SDT\u6539\u8fdb\u90bb\u5c45\u5173\u7cfb\u9884\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6770\u5361\u5fb7\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u5197\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4eba\u8138\u805a\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Data and code available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/prdeepakbabu/ProfASR-Bench https://github.com/prdeepakbabu/ProfASR-Bench", "summary": "Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in professional settings faces challenges that existing benchmarks underplay: dense domain terminology, formal register variation, and near-zero tolerance for critical entity errors. We present ProfASR-Bench, a professional-talk evaluation suite for high-stakes applications across finance, medicine, legal, and technology. Each example pairs a natural-language prompt (domain cue and/or speaker profile) with an entity-rich target utterance, enabling controlled measurement of context-conditioned recognition. The corpus supports conventional ASR metrics alongside entity-aware scores and slice-wise reporting by accent and gender. Using representative families Whisper (encoder-decoder ASR) and Qwen-Omni (audio language models) under matched no-context, profile, domain+profile, oracle, and adversarial conditions, we find a consistent pattern: lightweight textual context produces little to no change in average word error rate (WER), even with oracle prompts, and adversarial prompts do not reliably degrade performance. We term this the context-utilization gap (CUG): current systems are nominally promptable yet underuse readily available side information. ProfASR-Bench provides a standardized context ladder, entity- and slice-aware reporting with confidence intervals, and a reproducible testbed for comparing fusion strategies across model families.\n  Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/prdeepakbabu/ProfASR-Bench\n  Code: https://github.com/prdeepakbabu/ProfASR-Bench", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faProfASR-Bench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u91d1\u878d\u3001\u533b\u7597\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u6280\u672f\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5957\u4ef6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5e26\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e30\u5bcc\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u53e5\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u8bc6\u522b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524dASR\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u2018\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5229\u7528\u7387\u5dee\u8ddd\u2019\uff08CUG\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9636\u68af\u3001\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e0e\u5206\u7247\u611f\u77e5\u62a5\u544a\u53ca\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709ASR\u57fa\u51c6\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u53cd\u6620\u4e13\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5982\u5bc6\u96c6\u9886\u57df\u672f\u8bed\u3001\u6b63\u5f0f\u8bed\u4f53\u53d8\u5316\u53ca\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u5b9e\u4f53\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u96f6\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaProfASR-Bench\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6bcf\u6761\u6837\u672c\u5305\u542b\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u9886\u57df\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c/\u6216\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u4e0e\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u97f3\uff1b\u91c7\u7528Whisper\u548cQwen-Omni\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u4ec5\u89d2\u8272\u3001\u9886\u57df+\u89d2\u8272\u3001\u7406\u60f3\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e73\u5747\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff08WER\uff09\u53ca\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ea7\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u6309\u53e3\u97f3\u548c\u6027\u522b\u5206\u7247\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u5e73\u5747\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff08WER\uff09\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u5c0f\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528\u7406\u60f3\u63d0\u793a\u4e5f\u672a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u672a\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u524dASR\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5229\u7528\u7387\u5dee\u8ddd\uff08CUG\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u867d\u5177\u5907\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u4f46\u672a\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u7528\u4fa7\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "ProfASR-Bench\u4e3a\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigate the potential of constructing Vision-Language Models upon diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) to overcome these limitations. We introduce Dream-VL, an open diffusion-based VLM (dVLM) that achieves state-of-the-art performance among previous dVLMs. Dream-VL is comparable to top-tier AR-based VLMs trained on open data on various benchmarks but exhibits superior potential when applied to visual planning tasks. Building upon Dream-VL, we introduce Dream-VLA, a dLLM-based Vision-Language-Action model (dVLA) developed through continuous pre-training on open robotic datasets. We demonstrate that the natively bidirectional nature of this diffusion backbone serves as a superior foundation for VLA tasks, inherently suited for action chunking and parallel generation, leading to significantly faster convergence in downstream fine-tuning. Dream-VLA achieves top-tier performance of 97.2% average success rate on LIBERO, 71.4% overall average on SimplerEnv-Bridge, and 60.5% overall average on SimplerEnv-Fractal, surpassing leading models such as $\u03c0_0$ and GR00T-N1.

Some results are being finalized and may be updated in a future revision.}", "summary": "\\noindent Memory has become the central mechanism enabling robust visual object tracking in modern segmentation-based frameworks. Recent methods built upon Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) have demonstrated strong performance by refining how past observations are stored and reused. However, existing approaches address memory limitations in a method-specific manner, leaving the broader design principles of memory in SAM-based tracking poorly understood. Moreover, it remains unclear how these memory mechanisms transfer to stronger, next-generation foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3). In this work, we present a systematic memory-centric study of SAM-based visual object tracking. We first analyze representative SAM2-based trackers and show that most methods primarily differ in how short-term memory frames are selected, while sharing a common object-centric representation. Building on this insight, we faithfully reimplement these memory mechanisms within the SAM3 framework and conduct large-scale evaluations across ten diverse benchmarks, enabling a controlled analysis of memory design independent of backbone strength. Guided by our empirical findings, we propose a unified hybrid memory framework that explicitly decomposes memory into short-term appearance memory and long-term distractor-resolving memory. This decomposition enables the integration of existing memory policies in a modular and principled manner.

The code is available at https://github.com/efficient-learning-lab/TimePerceiver", "summary": "In machine learning, effective modeling requires a holistic consideration of how to encode inputs, make predictions (i.e., decoding), and train the model. However, in time-series forecasting, prior work has predominantly focused on encoder design, often treating prediction and training as separate or secondary concerns. In this paper, we propose TimePerceiver, a unified encoder-decoder forecasting framework that is tightly aligned with an effective training strategy. To be specific, we first generalize the forecasting task to include diverse temporal prediction objectives such as extrapolation, interpolation, and imputation. Since this generalization requires handling input and target segments that are arbitrarily positioned along the temporal axis, we design a novel encoder-decoder architecture that can flexibly perceive and adapt to these varying positions. For encoding, we introduce a set of latent bottleneck representations that can interact with all input segments to jointly capture temporal and cross-channel dependencies. For decoding, we leverage learnable queries corresponding to target timestamps to effectively retrieve relevant information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range of benchmark datasets.

Recent work proposes novel techniques to find natural language prompts that induce specific behaviors from a target model, yet they are mainly studied in single-turn settings. In this work, we study behavior elicitation in the context of multi-turn conversations. We first offer an analytical framework that categorizes existing methods into three families based on their interactions with the target model: those that use only prior knowledge, those that use offline interactions, and those that learn from online interactions. We then introduce a generalized multi-turn formulation of the online method, unifying single-turn and multi-turn elicitation. We evaluate all three families of methods on automatically generating multi-turn test cases. We investigate the efficiency of these approaches by analyzing the trade-off between the query budget, i.e., the number of interactions with the target model, and the success rate, i.e., the discovery rate of behavior-eliciting inputs. We find that online methods can achieve an average success rate of 45/19/77% with just a few thousand queries over three tasks where static methods from existing multi-turn conversation benchmarks find few or even no failure cases.

Video diffusion models, through their image-to-video generation capability, provide a promising foundation for such visual imagination. However, existing approaches are largely forward predictive, generating trajectories conditioned on the initial observation without explicit goal modeling, thus often leading to spatial drift and goal misalignment. To address these challenges, we propose Envision, a diffusion-based framework that performs visual planning for embodied agents. By explicitly constraining the generation with a goal image, our method enforces physical plausibility and goal consistency throughout the generated trajectory. Specifically, Envision operates in two stages. First, a Goal Imagery Model identifies task-relevant regions, performs region-aware cross attention between the scene and the instruction, and synthesizes a coherent goal image that captures the desired outcome. Then, an Env-Goal Video Model, built upon a first-and-last-frame-conditioned video diffusion model (FL2V), interpolates between the initial observation and the goal image, producing smooth and physically plausible video trajectories that connect the start and goal states. Experiments on object manipulation and image editing benchmarks demonstrate that Envision achieves superior goal alignment, spatial consistency, and object preservation compared to baselines. The resulting visual plans can directly support downstream robotic planning and control, providing reliable guidance for embodied agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "Envision is a diffusion-based visual planning framework for embodied agents that generates goal-conditioned video trajectories.

In many real systems, the ordering of feature values matters far more than their raw magnitudes - yet the structural conditions that a rank-based normalization operator must satisfy to remain stable under these invariances have never been formally pinned down.\n  We show that widely used differentiable sorting and ranking operators fundamentally fail these criteria. Because they rely on value gaps and batch-level pairwise interactions, they are intrinsically unstable under strictly monotone transformations, shifts in mini-batch composition, and even tiny input perturbations. Crucially, these failures stem from the operators' structural design, not from incidental implementation choices.\n  To address this, we propose three axioms that formalize the minimal invariance and stability properties required of rank-based input normalization. We prove that any operator satisfying these axioms must factor into (i) a feature-wise rank representation and (ii) a scalarization map that is both monotone and Lipschitz-continuous. We then construct a minimal operator that meets these criteria and empirically show that the resulting constraints are non-trivial in realistic setups.

Motivated by this, adapting RLHF for Image Super-Resolution (ISR) tasks has shown promise in optimizing perceptual quality with Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model as reward models. However, the traditional IQA model usually output a single global score, which are exceptionally insensitive to local and fine-grained distortions. This insensitivity allows ISR models to produce perceptually undesirable artifacts that yield spurious high scores, misaligning optimization objectives with perceptual quality and results in reward hacking. To address this, we propose a Fine-grained Perceptual Reward Model (FinPercep-RM) based on an Encoder-Decoder architecture. While providing a global quality score, it also generates a Perceptual Degradation Map that spatially localizes and quantifies local defects. We specifically introduce the FGR-30k dataset to train this model, consisting of diverse and subtle distortions from real-world super-resolution models. Despite the success of the FinPercep-RM model, its complexity introduces significant challenges in generator policy learning, leading to training instability. To address this, we propose a Co-evolutionary Curriculum Learning (CCL) mechanism, where both the reward model and the ISR model undergo synchronized curricula. The reward model progressively increases in complexity, while the ISR model starts with a simpler global reward for rapid convergence, gradually transitioning to the more complex model outputs. This easy-to-hard strategy enables stable training while suppressing reward hacking. Experiments validates the effectiveness of our method across ISR models in both global quality and local realism on RLHF methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08FinPercep-RM\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\uff08RLHF\uff09\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08IQA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u8f93\u51fa\u5168\u5c40\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5bf9\u5c40\u90e8\u5931\u771f\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u5956\u52b1\u6ee5\u7528\u3002FinPercep-RM\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5168\u5c40\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u8fd8\u751f\u6210\u7a7a\u95f4\u5316\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u9000\u5316\u56fe\uff0c\u7cbe\u51c6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u5c40\u90e8\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u591a\u6837\u7ec6\u5fae\u5931\u771f\u7684FGR-30k\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CCL\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u540c\u6b65\u5347\u7ea7\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u9010\u6b65\u589e\u52a0\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u5168\u5c40\u5956\u52b1\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7531\u6613\u5230\u96be\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5168\u5c40\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709RLHF\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u8f93\u51fa\u5355\u4e00\u5168\u5c40\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5bf9\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5931\u771f\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u770b\u4f3c\u9ad8\u5206\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u7684\u4f2a\u4f18\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u5956\u52b1\u6ee5\u7528\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08FinPercep-RM\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u5168\u5c40\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u9000\u5316\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u6784\u5efaFGR-30k\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CCL\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u540c\u6b65\u3001\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5168\u5c40\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u5728RLHF\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u5956\u52b1\u6ee5\u7528\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e2d\u56e0\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7c97\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6ee5\u7528\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

Recently, crash data has increasingly revealed that AV behavior can deviate from expected safety outcomes, raising concerns about the technology's safety and operational reliability in mixed traffic environments. While past research has investigated AV crash, most studies rely on small-size California-centered datasets, with a limited focus on understanding crash trends across various SAE Levels of automation. This study analyzes over 2,500 AV crash records from the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), covering SAE Levels 2 and 4, to uncover underlying crash dynamics. A two-stage data mining framework is developed. K-means clustering is first applied to segment crash records into 4 distinct behavioral clusters based on temporal, spatial, and environmental factors.

We report state-of-the-art performance in indoor benchmarks under constrained training conditions, and strong performance when applied to outdoor datasets.

Current learning-based approaches often suffer from a fragmented paradigm: generative models capture diversity but lack reliable energy calibration, whereas deterministic predictors target a single structure and fail to represent ensemble variability. Here we present EnFlow, a unified framework that couples flow matching (FM) with an explicitly learned energy model through an energy-guided sampling scheme defined along a non-Gaussian FM path. By incorporating energy-gradient guidance during sampling, our method steers trajectories toward lower-energy regions, substantially improving conformational fidelity, particularly in the few-step regime. The learned energy function further enables efficient energy-based ranking of generated ensembles for accurate ground-state identification. Extensive experiments on GEOM-QM9 and GEOM-Drugs demonstrate that EnFlow simultaneously improves generation metrics with 1--2 ODE-steps and reduces ground-state prediction errors compared with state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "EnFlow \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff08FM\uff09\u4e0e\u663e\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u80fd\u91cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u975e\u9ad8\u65afFM\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u751f\u6210\u4f4e\u80fd\u6784\u8c61\u96c6\u5e76\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u6001\u6784\u8c61\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u80fd\u91cf\u68af\u5ea6\u6307\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5c11\u6b65\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u6784\u8c61\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u6392\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6784\u8c61\u96c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u51c6\u57fa\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u5728GEOM-QM9\u548cGEOM-Drugs\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEnFlow\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u57fa\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4f4e\u80fd\u6784\u8c61\u96c6\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u6001\u6784\u8c61\u65b9\u9762\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8303\u5f0f\u788e\u7247\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u53ea\u80fd\u8f93\u51fa\u5355\u4e00\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4f53\u73b0\u6784\u8c61\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u6784\u8c61\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u57fa\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "EnFlow \u91c7\u7528\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff08FM\uff09\u4e0e\u663e\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6cbf\u975e\u9ad8\u65afFM\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\u3002\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u80fd\u91cf\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u8f68\u8ff9\u5411\u4f4e\u80fd\u533a\u57df\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6784\u8c61\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6784\u8c61\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u80fd\u91cf\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u6001\u6784\u8c61\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5728GEOM-QM9\u548cGEOM-Drugs\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cEnFlow \u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75281\u20132\u4e2a\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08ODE\uff09\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6784\u8c61\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u57fa\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "EnFlow \u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u4e0e\u80fd\u91cf\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6784\u8c61\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u57fa\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6781\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6784\u8c61\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u57fa\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u5b50\u6784\u8c61\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Echocardiography, as a readily accessible and non-invasive imaging modality, is widely used in clinical practice to estimate LVEF. However, manual assessment of cardiac function from echocardiograms is time-consuming and subject to considerable inter-observer variability. Deep learning approaches offer a promising alternative, with the potential to achieve performance comparable to that of experienced human experts. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of several deep learning architectures for LVEF estimation from echocardiography videos, including 3D Inception, two-stream, and CNN-RNN models. We systematically evaluate architectural modifications and fusion strategies to identify configurations that maximize prediction accuracy. Models were trained and evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, comprising 10,030 echocardiogram videos. Our results demonstrate that modified 3D Inception architectures achieve the best overall performance, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 6.79%. Across architectures, we observe a tendency toward overfitting, with smaller and simpler models generally exhibiting improved generalization. Model performance was also found to be highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, particularly convolutional kernel sizes and normalization strategies. While this study focuses on echocardiography-based LVEF estimation, the insights gained regarding architectural design and training strategies may be applicable to a broader range of medical and non-medical video analysis tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u58f0\u5fc3\u52a8\u56fe\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u5de6\u5fc3\u5ba4\u5c04\u8840\u5206\u6570\uff08LVEF\uff09\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec3D Inception\u3001\u53cc\u6d41\u548cCNN-RNN\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\u4e0e\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u76843D Inception\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0cRMSE\u4e3a6.79%\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u5c0f\u800c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5177\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982\u5377\u79ef\u6838\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff09\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u8d85\u58f0\u5fc3\u52a8\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc3\u810f\u529f\u80fd\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u671b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u9002\u7528\u4e8eLVEF\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u75283D Inception\u3001\u53cc\u6d41\u548cCNN-RNN\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5305\u542b10,030\u4e2a\u8d85\u58f0\u5fc3\u52a8\u56fe\u89c6\u9891\u7684EchoNet-Dynamic\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0e\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u70b9\u8003\u5bdf\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u76843D Inception\u6a21\u578b\u5728LVEF\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u8fbe\u52306.79%\u7684\u6839\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b\u8f83\u5c0f\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u666e\u904d\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u5377\u79ef\u6838\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7b49\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u6781\u4e3a\u654f\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8d85\u58f0\u5fc3\u52a8\u56fe\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u4f30\u7b97LVEF\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6539\u8fdb\u76843D Inception\u67b6\u6784\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u533b\u7597\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u89c6\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u53c2\u8003\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, numerous downstream tasks in specialized and data-limited scientific domains continue to pose significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel Cluster Attention Adapter (CLAdapter), which refines and adapts the rich representations learned from large-scale data to various data-limited downstream tasks. Specifically, CLAdapter introduces attention mechanisms and cluster centers to personalize the enhancement of transformed features through distribution correlation and transformation matrices. This enables models fine-tuned with CLAdapter to learn distinct representations tailored to different feature sets, facilitating the models' adaptation from rich pre-trained features to various downstream scenarios effectively. In addition, CLAdapter's unified interface design allows for seamless integration with multiple model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers, in both 2D and 3D contexts. Through extensive experiments on 10 datasets spanning domains such as generic, multimedia, biological, medical, industrial, agricultural, environmental, geographical, materials science, out-of-distribution (OOD), and 3D analysis, CLAdapter achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse data-limited scientific domains, demonstrating its effectiveness in unleashing the potential of foundation vision models via adaptive transfer.

Biased compression techniques are effective in practice, but require error feedback mechanisms to provide theoretical guarantees and to ensure convergence when compression is aggressive. Standard error feedback, however, relies on client-specific control variates, which violates user privacy and is incompatible with stateless clients common in large-scale FL. This paper proposes two novel frameworks that enable biased compression without client-side state or control variates. The first, Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe), uses the globally aggregated update from the previous round as a shared control variate for all clients. The second, Server-Guided Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe-S), extends this idea to scenarios where the server possesses a small private dataset; it generates a server-guided candidate update to be used as a more accurate predictor. We consider Distributed Gradient Descent (DGD) as a representative algorithm and analytically prove CAFe's superiority to Distributed Compressed Gradient Descent (DCGD) with biased compression in the non-convex regime with bounded gradient dissimilarity. We further prove that CAFe-S converges to a stationary point, with a rate that improves as the server's data become more representative. Experimental results in FL scenarios validate the superiority of our approaches over existing compression schemes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff08CAFe\u548cCAFe-S\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u72b6\u6001\u6216\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u504f\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u805a\u5408\u66f4\u65b0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5171\u4eab\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u6216\u7ed3\u5408\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u4f18\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u573a\u666f\u4e0bCAFe\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14CAFe-S\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u968f\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4e0a\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u4f20\u8f93\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5e26\u5bbd\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u6709\u504f\u538b\u7f29\u867d\u6709\u6548\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u635f\u5bb3\u9690\u79c1\u4e14\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u517c\u987e\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u6027\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09CAFe\u5229\u7528\u524d\u4e00\u8f6e\u5168\u5c40\u805a\u5408\u66f4\u65b0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6240\u6709\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\uff1b2\uff09CAFe-S\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f15\u5165\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5019\u9009\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff08DGD\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86CAFe\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u5df2\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u68af\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u6709\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1bCAFe-S\u53ef\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u7a33\u5b9a\u70b9\uff0c\u5176\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u968f\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u800c\u52a0\u5feb\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684CAFe\u548cCAFe-S\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u6709\u504f\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u72b6\u6001\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u4e0b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We introduce CritiFusion, a novel inference-time framework that integrates a multimodal semantic critique mechanism with frequency-domain refinement to improve text-to-image consistency and detail. The proposed CritiCore module leverages a vision-language model and multiple large language models to enrich the prompt context and produce high-level semantic feedback, guiding the diffusion process to better align generated content with the prompt's intent. Additionally, SpecFusion merges intermediate generation states in the spectral domain, injecting coarse structural information while preserving high-frequency details. No additional model training is required. CritiFusion serves as a plug-in refinement stage compatible with existing diffusion backbones. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our method notably improves human-aligned metrics of text-to-image correspondence and visual quality. CritiFusion consistently boosts performance on human preference scores and aesthetic evaluations, achieving results on par with state-of-the-art reward optimization approaches. Qualitative results further demonstrate superior detail, realism, and prompt fidelity, indicating the effectiveness of our semantic critique and spectral alignment strategy.", "AI": {"tldr": "CritiFusion\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u6279\u5224\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u9891\u57df\u7cbe\u70bc\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u3002\u5176CritiCore\u6a21\u5757\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u793a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u5339\u914d\u63d0\u793a\u610f\u56fe\uff1bSpecFusion\u5219\u5728\u9891\u57df\u4e2d\u878d\u5408\u4e2d\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u6ce8\u5165\u7c97\u7565\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d2\u4ef6\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u517c\u5bb9\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u7f8e\u5b66\u8bc4\u4ef7\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u5ab2\u7f8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u610f\u56fe\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u7ec6\u8282\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCritiFusion\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1aCritiCore\u6a21\u5757\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u6279\u5224\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5c42\u53cd\u9988\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1bSpecFusion\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u9891\u57df\u4e2d\u878d\u5408\u4e2d\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u6ce8\u5165\u4e0e\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u7559\u3002\u6574\u4e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d2\u4ef6\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u9002\u914d\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCritiFusion\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u7f8e\u5b66\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5148\u8fdb\u5956\u52b1\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u7ec6\u8282\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u660e\u663e\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "CritiFusion\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u6279\u5224\u4e0e\u9891\u57df\u7cbe\u70bc\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, many real-world tasks involve multi-stage pipeline whose final outcomes lack verifiable rewards or sufficient data to train robust reward models, making judge-based refinement prone to accumulate error over stages. We propose Selective TTS, a process-based refinement framework that scales inference across different stages in multi-agent pipeline, instead of repeated refinement over time by prior work. By distributing compute across stages and pruning low-quality branches early using process-specific judges, Selective TTS mitigates the judge drift and stabilizes refinement. Grounded in the data science pipeline, we build an end-to-end multi-agent pipeline for generating visually insightful charts and report of given dataset, and design a reliable LLM-based judge model, aligned with human experts (Kendall's \u03c4=0.55). Our proposed selective TTS then improves insight quality under a fixed compute budget, increasing mean scores from 61.64 to 65.86 while reducing variance.

With better training data that is diverse and covers a wide range of situations, including long-tailed driving scenarios, autonomous driving models can become more robust and safer. This motivates a unified simulation framework that can jointly handle realistic integration of inserted 3D assets and NVS. Recent 3D asset reconstruction methods enable reconstruction of dynamic actors from video, supporting their re-insertion into simulated driving scenes. While the overall structure and appearance can be accurate, it still struggles to capture the realism of 3D assets through lighting or shadows, particularly when inserted into scenes. In parallel, recent advances in NVS methods have demonstrated promising results in synthesizing viewpoints beyond the originally recorded trajectories. However, existing approaches largely treat asset insertion and NVS capabilities in isolation. To allow for interaction with the rest of the scene and to enable more diverse creation of new scenarios for training, realistic 3D asset insertion should be combined with NVS. To address this, we present SCPainter (Street Car Painter), a unified framework which integrates 3D Gaussian Splat (GS) car asset representations and 3D scene point clouds with diffusion-based generation to jointly enable realistic 3D asset insertion and NVS. The 3D GS assets and 3D scene point clouds are projected together into novel views, and these projections are used to condition a diffusion model to generate high quality images.

Automated detection can increase reproducibility and support scalable early screening programs, but supervised deep learning methods are limited by small labelled datasets. This study assesses whether ultrasound-specific self-supervised pretraining can facilitate accurate, robust deep learning detection of cystic hygroma in first-trimester ultrasound images. We fine-tuned the Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), pretrained on over 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images, for binary classification of normal controls and cystic hygroma cases used in this study. Performance was evaluated on the same curated ultrasound dataset, preprocessing pipeline, and 4-fold cross-validation protocol as for the DenseNet-169 baseline, using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). Model interpretability was analyzed qualitatively using Score-CAM visualizations. USF-MAE outperformed the DenseNet-169 baseline on all evaluation metrics. The proposed model yielded a mean accuracy of 0.96, sensitivity of 0.94, specificity of 0.98, and ROC-AUC of 0.98 compared to 0.93, 0.92, 0.94, and 0.94 for the DenseNet-169 baseline, respectively. Qualitative Score-CAM visualizations of model predictions demonstrated clinical relevance by highlighting expected regions in the fetal neck for both positive and negative cases. Paired statistical analysis using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test confirmed that performance improvements achieved by USF-MAE were statistically significant (p = 0.0057).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8d85\u58f0\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578bUSF-MAE\u5728\u9996\u5b55\u671f\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u56ca\u6027\u6c34\u7624\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8d85\u8fc737\u4e07\u5f20\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0cUSF-MAE\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8eDenseNet-169\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3001\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u548cROC-AUC\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u663e\u8457\uff08p=0.0057\uff09\u3002\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u533a\u57df\u5177\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u56ca\u6027\u6c34\u7624\u662f\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u4ea7\u524d\u8d85\u58f0\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5e38\u4f34\u968f\u67d3\u8272\u4f53\u5f02\u5e38\u548c\u4e0d\u826f\u598a\u5a20\u7ed3\u5c40\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u76d1\u7763\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u65e9\u671f\u7b5b\u67e5\u3002\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u5927\u91cf\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u8d85\u58f0\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578bUSF-MAE\uff0c\u5728\u8d85\u8fc737\u4e07\u5f20\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u7528\u4e8e\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\uff08\u6b63\u5e38\u5bf9\u7167\u4e0e\u56ca\u6027\u6c34\u7624\u75c5\u4f8b\uff09\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u91c7\u7528\u4e0eDenseNet-169\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u56db\u6298\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3001\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u53caROC-AUC\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Score-CAM\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "USF-MAE\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eDenseNet-169\uff1a\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a0.96\uff08\u57fa\u7ebf0.93\uff09\uff0c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e3a0.94\uff08\u57fa\u7ebf0.92\uff09\uff0c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4e3a0.98\uff08\u57fa\u7ebf0.94\uff09\uff0cROC-AUC\u4e3a0.98\uff08\u57fa\u7ebf0.94\uff09\u3002\u914d\u5bf9\u5a01\u5c14\u79d1\u514b\u68ee\u7b26\u53f7\u79e9\u68c0\u9a8c\u786e\u8ba4\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5177\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08p=0.0057\uff09\u3002Score-CAM\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u80ce\u513f\u9888\u90e8\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d85\u58f0\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56ca\u6027\u6c34\u7624\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4ea7\u524d\u7b5b\u67e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Recent methods achieve this by lifting video segmentation results to a 4D representation through differentiable rendering techniques. Therefore, they heavily rely on the quality of video segmentation maps, which are often unstable, leading to unreliable reconstruction results. To overcome this challenge, our key idea is to represent the decomposed 4D scene with the Freetime FeatureGS and design a streaming feature learning strategy to accurately recover it from per-image segmentation maps, eliminating the need for video segmentation. Freetime FeatureGS models the dynamic scene as a set of Gaussian primitives with learnable features and linear motion ability, allowing them to move to neighboring regions over time. We apply a contrastive loss to Freetime FeatureGS, forcing primitive features to be close or far apart based on whether their projections belong to the same instance in the 2D segmentation map. As our Gaussian primitives can move across time, it naturally extends the feature learning to the temporal dimension, achieving 4D segmentation. Furthermore, we sample observations for training in a temporally ordered manner, enabling the streaming propagation of features over time and effectively avoiding local minima during the optimization process. Experimental results on several datasets show that the reconstruction quality of our method outperforms recent methods by a large margin.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eFreetime FeatureGS\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5355\u5e27\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u56fe\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u89e3\u76844D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d41\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4f7f\u9ad8\u65af\u539f\u8bed\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u76844D\u5206\u5272\u4e0e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c4D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4f46\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u3001\u80fd\u4ece\u5355\u5e27\u5206\u5272\u56fe\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u6062\u590d\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFreetime FeatureGS\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u8fd0\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u539f\u8bed\u96c6\u5408\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4f7f\u540c\u4e00\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5f02\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u6709\u5e8f\u91c7\u6837\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u6d41\u5f0f\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57284D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u89e34D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

However, the large quantity of newly proposed architectures, together with often contradictory empirical results, makes it difficult to assess which components contribute significantly to final performance. We aim to make sense of the current design space of deep learning architectures for time series forecasting by discussing the design dimensions and trade-offs that can explain, often unexpected, observed results. This paper discusses the necessity of grounding model design on principles for forecasting groups of time series and how such principles can be applied to current models. In particular, we assess how concepts such as locality and globality apply to recent forecasting architectures. We show that accounting for these aspects can be more relevant for achieving accurate results than adopting specific sequence modeling layers and that simple, well-designed forecasting architectures can often match the state of the art. We discuss how overlooked implementation details in existing architectures (1) fundamentally change the class of the resulting forecasting method and (2) drastically affect the observed empirical results. Our results call for rethinking current faulty benchmarking practices and the need to focus on the foundational aspects of the forecasting problem when designing architectures.

They typically encode visual inputs into Original Model sequences of tokens, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly processed by the language model. However, the growing number of visual tokens greatly increases inference cost. Visual token pruning has emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods often overlook scenarios involving long context inputs with multiple images. In this paper, we analyze the challenges of visual token pruning in long context, multi-image settings and introduce an adaptive pruning method tailored for such scenarios. We decompose redundancy into intra-image and inter-image components and quantify them through intra-image diversity and inter-image variation, which jointly guide dynamic budget allocation. Our approach consists of two stages. The intra-image stage allocates each image a content-aware token budget and greedily selects its most representative tokens. The inter-image stage performs global diversity filtering to form a candidate pool and then applies a Pareto selection procedure that balances diversity with text alignment. Extensive experiments show that our approach maintains strong performance in long context settings while significantly cutting down the number of visual tokens.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u526a\u679d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u5197\u4f59\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u95f4\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u91cf\u5316\u5176\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u53d8\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u526a\u679d\u9884\u7b97\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u9636\u6bb5\u6839\u636e\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u914d\u9884\u7b97\u5e76\u8d2a\u5a6a\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5177\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\uff1b\u56fe\u50cf\u95f4\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5c40\u591a\u6837\u6027\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u9009\u62e9\u5e73\u8861\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u95f4\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u526a\u679d\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5197\u4f59\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u526a\u679d\u9884\u7b97\uff1b\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6267\u884c\uff1a\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u9636\u6bb5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u914d\u9884\u7b97\u5e76\u8d2a\u5a6a\u9009\u62e9\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6807\u8bb0\uff1b\u56fe\u50cf\u95f4\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u591a\u6837\u6027\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4e0e\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u9009\u62e9\u5e73\u8861\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u5197\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

Existing token merging and pruning strategies often overlook spatial continuity and neighbor relationships, resulting in the loss of local context. This paper proposes novel neighbor-aware token reduction methods based on Hilbert curve reordering, which explicitly preserves the neighbor structure in a 2D space using 1D sequential representations.

Although effective, we observe that such similarity distributions across grades usually exhibit multimodal patterns. For instance, an image embedding may show high similarity to both \"excellent\" and \"poor\" grade descriptions while deviating from the \"good\" one. We refer to this phenomenon as \"semantic drift\", where semantic inconsistencies between text embeddings and their intended descriptions undermine the reliability of text-image shared-space learning. To mitigate this issue, we draw inspiration from psychometrics and propose an improved Graded Response Model (GRM) for AGIQA. The GRM is a classical assessment model that categorizes a subject's ability across grades using test items with various difficulty levels. This paradigm aligns remarkably well with human quality rating, where image quality can be interpreted as an image's ability to meet various quality grades. Building on this philosophy, we design a two-branch quality grading module: one branch estimates image ability while the other constructs multiple difficulty levels. To ensure monotonicity in difficulty levels, we further model difficulty generation in an arithmetic manner, which inherently enforces a unimodal and interpretable quality distribution. Our Arithmetic GRM based Quality Grading (AGQG) module enjoys a plug-and-play advantage, consistently improving performance when integrated into various state-of-the-art AGIQA frameworks. Moreover, it also generalizes effectively to both natural and screen content image quality assessment, revealing its potential as a key component in future IQA models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b97\u672f\u68af\u5ea6\u54cd\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\uff08AGQG\uff09\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709AGIQA\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u56e0\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u501f\u9274\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u7ea7\u54cd\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\uff08GRM\uff09\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4f30\u8ba1\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u96be\u5ea6\u7b49\u7ea7\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u7b97\u672f\u65b9\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u96be\u5ea6\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5206\u5e03\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5148\u8fdbAGIQA\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u5c4f\u5e55\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AGIQA\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f46\u53d1\u73b0\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5206\u5e03\u5e38\u5448\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u56fe\u50cf\u53ef\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u4e0e\u2018\u4f18\u79c0\u2019\u548c\u2018\u5dee\u2019\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u800c\u4e0e\u2018\u826f\u597d\u2019\u504f\u79bb\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u79f0\u4e3a\u2018\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u2019\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u5171\u4eab\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7b97\u672f\u68af\u5ea6\u54cd\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\uff08AGQG\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u7ed3\u6784\uff1a\u4e00\u679d\u4f30\u8ba1\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u679d\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u4e2a\u96be\u5ea6\u7b49\u7ea7\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u672f\u65b9\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u96be\u5ea6\u5e8f\u5217\u5355\u8c03\u9012\u589e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u5cf0\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "AGQG\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41AGIQA\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7279\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u5c4f\u5e55\u5185\u5bb9\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684GRM\u601d\u60f3\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7b97\u672f\u96be\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684AGQG\u6a21\u5757\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002"}}

Existing solver-based acceleration methods often face significant image quality degradation under a low-latency budget, primarily due to accumulated truncation errors arising from the inability to capture high-curvature trajectory segments. In this paper, we propose the Ensemble Parallel Direction solver (dubbed as EPD-Solver), a novel ODE solver that mitigates these errors by incorporating multiple parallel gradient evaluations in each step. Motivated by the geometric insight that sampling trajectories are largely confined to a low-dimensional manifold, EPD-Solver leverages the Mean Value Theorem for vector-valued functions to approximate the integral solution more accurately. Importantly, since the additional gradient computations are independent, they can be fully parallelized, preserving low-latency sampling nature. We introduce a two-stage optimization framework. Initially, EPD-Solver optimizes a small set of learnable parameters via a distillation-based approach. We further propose a parameter-efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning scheme that reformulates the solver as a stochastic Dirichlet policy. Unlike traditional methods that fine-tune the massive backbone, our RL approach operates strictly within the low-dimensional solver space, effectively mitigating reward hacking while enhancing performance in complex text-to-image (T2I) generation tasks. In addition, our method is flexible and can serve as a plugin (EPD-Plugin) to improve existing ODE samplers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faEPD-Solver\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u5e73\u884c\u68af\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08ODE\uff09\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u6d1e\u5bdf\u548c\u5411\u91cf\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e2d\u503c\u5b9a\u7406\u63d0\u5347\u91c7\u6837\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7279\u6027\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c11\u91cf\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6c42\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u907f\u514d\u5956\u52b1\u52ab\u6301\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d2\u4ef6\u96c6\u6210\u81f3\u73b0\u6709ODE\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u6709\u4f18\u5f02\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u5e8f\u5217\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bfc\u81f4\u91c7\u6837\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u6613\u56e0\u7d2f\u79ef\u622a\u65ad\u8bef\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u66f2\u7387\u8f68\u8ff9\u6bb5\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\u53c8\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEPD-Solver\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u5e76\u884c\u68af\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u4e2d\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u903c\u8fd1\u79ef\u5206\u89e3\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f4d\u4e8e\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5411\u91cf\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e2d\u503c\u5b9a\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4f18\u5316\u5c11\u91cf\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5c06\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u72c4\u5229\u514b\u96f7\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6c42\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u52ab\u6301\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d2\u4ef6\uff08EPD-Plugin\uff09\u9002\u914d\u73b0\u6709\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u3002", "result": "EPD-Solver\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91c7\u6837\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u66f2\u7387\u533a\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff1b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5956\u52b1\u52ab\u6301\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d2\u4ef6\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u81f3\u591a\u79cd\u73b0\u6709\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "EPD-Solver\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5e76\u884c\u68af\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u6837\u4e2d\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u9000\u5316\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u3002\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Traditional epidemiological studies typically analyze these levels independently, limiting insights into how structural environmental conditions interact with individual-level characteristics to influence health outcomes. In this study, we introduce a micro-macro machine learning framework that integrates (1) individual-level anthropometric and socioeconomic data from NHANES and (2) macro-level structural environment features, including food access, air quality, and socioeconomic vulnerability extracted from USDA and EPA datasets. Four machine learning models Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM were trained to predict obesity using NHANES microdata. XGBoost achieved the strongest performance. A composite environmental vulnerability index (EnvScore) was constructed using normalized indicators from USDA and EPA at the state level.

Existing methods, however, are typically limited to local search, making them prone to failures under viewpoint changes, occlusions, and rapid target movements. In this work, we introduce the first global tracking framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (VPTracker), exploiting their powerful semantic reasoning to locate targets across the entire image space. While global search improves robustness and reduces drift, it also introduces distractions from visually or semantically similar objects. To address this, we propose a location-aware visual prompting mechanism that incorporates spatial priors into the MLLM. Specifically, we construct a region-level prompt based on the target's previous location, enabling the model to prioritize region-level recognition and resort to global inference only when necessary. This design retains the advantages of global tracking while effectively suppressing interference from distracting visual content. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly enhances tracking stability and target disambiguation under challenging scenarios, opening a new avenue for integrating MLLMs into visual tracking.

A promising solution is the use of scale-aware hyperparameters, which can enable direct transfer of optimal HPs from small-scale grid searches to large models with minimal performance loss. To understand the principles governing such transfer strategy, we develop a general conceptual framework for reasoning about HP transfer across scale, characterizing transfer as fast when the suboptimality it induces vanishes asymptotically faster than the finite-scale performance gap. We show formally that fast transfer is equivalent to useful transfer for compute-optimal grid search, meaning that transfer is asymptotically more compute-efficient than direct tuning. While empirical work has found that the Maximal Update Parameterization ($\u03bc$P) exhibits fast transfer when scaling model width, the mechanisms remain poorly understood. We show that this property depends critically on problem structure by presenting synthetic settings where transfer either offers provable computational advantage or fails to outperform direct tuning even under $\u03bc$P. To explain the fast transfer observed in practice, we conjecture that decomposing the optimization trajectory reveals two contributions to loss reduction: (1) a width-stable component that determines the optimal HPs, and (2) a width-sensitive component that improves with width but weakly perturbs the HP optimum.

We present VL-RouterBench to assess the overall capability of VLM routing systems systematically. The benchmark is grounded in raw inference and scoring logs from VLMs and constructs quality and cost matrices over sample-model pairs. In scale, VL-RouterBench covers 14 datasets across 3 task groups, totaling 30,540 samples, and includes 15 open-source models and 2 API models, yielding 519,180 sample-model pairs and a total input-output token volume of 34,494,977. The evaluation protocol jointly measures average accuracy, average cost, and throughput, and builds a ranking score from the harmonic mean of normalized cost and accuracy to enable comparison across router configurations and cost budgets. On this benchmark, we evaluate 10 routing methods and baselines and observe a significant routability gain, while the best current routers still show a clear gap to the ideal Oracle, indicating considerable room for improvement in router architecture through finer visual cues and modeling of textual structure.

Together, these components form a coherent physics-driven alternative to conventional cross-entropy training and transformer attention, providing robust generalization, interpretable semantics, and emergent topology.\n  Empirically, Schr\u00f6dinger AI demonstrates: (a) emergent semantic manifolds that reflect human-conceived class relations without explicit supervision; (b) dynamic reasoning that adapts to changing environments, including maze navigation with real-time potential-field perturbations; and (c) exact operator generalization on modular arithmetic tasks, where the system learns group actions and composes them across sequences far beyond training length. These results suggest a new foundational direction for machine learning, where learning is cast as discovering and navigating an underlying semantic energy landscape.", "AI": {"tldr": "Schr\u00f6dinger AI \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u65f6\u95f4\u65e0\u5173\u6ce2-\u80fd\u91cf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff08\u5c06\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u89c6\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684\u8c31\u5206\u89e3\uff09\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff08\u9a71\u52a8\u8bed\u4e49\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u51b3\u7b56\u4fee\u6b63\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f4e\u79e9\u7b97\u5b50\u5fae\u79ef\u5206\uff08\u5b66\u4e60\u7c7b\u91cf\u5b50\u8fc7\u6e21\u7b97\u5b50\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b26\u53f7\u53d8\u6362\u5982\u6a21\u8fd0\u7b97\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u9c81\u68d2\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u6d8c\u73b0\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0eTransformer\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u81ea\u53d1\u5f62\u6210\u53cd\u6620\u4eba\u7c7b\u7c7b\u522b\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6d41\u5f62\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u5982\u5e26\u5b9e\u65f6\u52bf\u573a\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u8ff7\u5bab\u5bfc\u822a\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6a21\u8fd0\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5916\u63a8\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u8bad\u7ec3\u548cTransformer\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff09\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\uff08\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f7f\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6210\u4e3a\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u5bfc\u822a\u6f5c\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u80fd\u91cf\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSchr\u00f6dinger AI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\uff1a(1) \u65f6\u95f4\u65e0\u5173\u6ce2-\u80fd\u91cf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u8c31\u5206\u89e3\uff1b(2) \u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u8bed\u4e49\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\uff1b(3) \u4f4e\u79e9\u7b97\u5b50\u5fae\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7c7b\u8f6c\u79fb\u7b97\u5b50\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b26\u53f7\u64cd\u4f5c\uff08\u5982\u6a21\u8fd0\u7b97\uff09\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u3002\u6574\u4f53\u4ee5\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u5f0f\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "(a) \u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u53d1\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u6620\u4eba\u7c7b\u6982\u5ff5\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u76d1\u7763\uff1b(b) \u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5982\u5b9e\u65f6\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u8ff7\u5bab\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u91cd\u89c4\u5212\uff1b(c) \u5728\u6a21\u8fd0\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5916\u63a8\uff0c\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u8de8\u5e8f\u5217\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u8fdc\u8d85\u8bad\u7ec3\u957f\u5ea6\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u62d3\u6251\u6d8c\u73b0\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "Schr\u00f6dinger AI \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u7684\u5168\u65b0\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u5bfc\u822a\u8bed\u4e49\u80fd\u91cf\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u5b9e\u73b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

A crucial feature of these AI co-scientists is the ability to generate a research plan given a set of aims and constraints. The plan may be used by researchers for brainstorming, or may even be implemented after further refinement. However, language models currently struggle to generate research plans that follow all constraints and implicit requirements. In this work, we study how to leverage the vast corpus of existing research papers to train language models that generate better research plans. We build a scalable, diverse training corpus by automatically extracting research goals and goal-specific grading rubrics from papers across several domains. We then train models for research plan generation via reinforcement learning with self-grading. A frozen copy of the initial policy acts as the grader during training, with the rubrics creating a generator-verifier gap that enables improvements without external human supervision. To validate this approach, we conduct a study with human experts for machine learning research goals, spanning 225 hours. The experts prefer plans generated by our finetuned Qwen3-30B-A3B model over the initial model for 70% of research goals, and approve 84% of the automatically extracted goal-specific grading rubrics. To assess generality, we also extend our approach to research goals from medical papers, and new arXiv preprints, evaluating with a jury of frontier models. Our finetuning yields 12-22% relative improvements and significant cross-domain generalization, proving effective even in problem settings like medical research where execution feedback is infeasible. Together, these findings demonstrate the potential of a scalable, automated training recipe as a step towards improving general AI co-scientists.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u79d1\u7814\u8bba\u6587\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u4f18\u7814\u7a76\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u81ea\u8bc4\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u521d\u59cb\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u51bb\u7ed3\u7248\u672c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5206\u5668\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u751f\u6210-\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u572870%\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u6807\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u504f\u597d\uff0c84%\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u88ab\u8ba4\u53ef\uff1b\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u533b\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\u548carXiv\u9884\u5370\u672c\u540e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad812-22%\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u6267\u884c\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u9886\u57df\u5982\u533b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u6240\u6709\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u9690\u542b\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8ba1\u5212\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u79d1\u7814\u6587\u732e\u8d44\u6e90\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u7814\u7a76\u8ba1\u5212\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u901a\u7528AI\u79d1\u7814\u52a9\u624b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u591a\u9886\u57df\u79d1\u7814\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u6807\u53ca\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u7b56\u7565\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u8bc4\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684Qwen3-30B-A3B\u6a21\u578b\u572870%\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u521d\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c84%\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u88ab\u4e13\u5bb6\u8ba4\u53ef\uff1b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\u548carXiv\u9884\u5370\u672c\u4e0a\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b012-22%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6267\u884c\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f9d\u7136\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347AI\u79d1\u7814\u52a9\u624b\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684AI co-scientist\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u96be\u4ee5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u590d\u6742\u79d1\u7814\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, faithfully modeling such reactions from egocentric video remains challenging due to the dual requirements of strictly causal generation and precise 3D spatial alignment. To tackle this problem, we first construct the Human Reaction Dataset (HRD) to address data scarcity and misalignment by building a spatially aligned egocentric video-reaction dataset, as existing datasets (e.g., ViMo) suffer from significant spatial inconsistency between the egocentric video and reaction motion, e.g., dynamically moving motions are always paired with fixed-camera videos. Leveraging HRD, we present EgoReAct, the first autoregressive framework that generates 3D-aligned human reaction motions from egocentric video streams in real-time. We first compress the reaction motion into a compact yet expressive latent space via a Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder and then train a Generative Pre-trained Transformer for reaction generation from the visual input. EgoReAct incorporates 3D dynamic features, i.e., metric depth, and head dynamics during the generation, which effectively enhance spatial grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EgoReAct achieves remarkably higher realism, spatial consistency, and generation efficiency compared with prior methods, while maintaining strict causality during generation. We will release code, models, and data upon acceptance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faEgoReact\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u751f\u62103D\u5bf9\u9f50\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u5e94\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efaHRD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u538b\u7f29\u52a8\u4f5c\u5230\u7d27\u51d1\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u5f0fTransformer\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u786e3D\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u53cd\u5e94\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u5ea6\u91cf\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u5934\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\u7b493D\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEgoReact\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e25\u683c\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5982ViMo\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u53cd\u5e94\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u663e\u8457\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u52a8\u6001\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e38\u4e0e\u56fa\u5b9a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u89c6\u9891\u914d\u5bf9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u53cd\u5e94\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e14\u56e0\u679c\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u6784\u5efa\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u5e94\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08HRD\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51faEgoReact\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08VQ-VAE\uff09\u5c06\u52a8\u4f5c\u538b\u7f29\u81f3\u7d27\u51d1\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08GPT\uff09\u6839\u636e\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u5e94\u52a8\u4f5c\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5ea6\u91cf\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5934\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\u4f5c\u4e3a3D\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u3002", "result": "EgoReact\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u548c3D\u5bf9\u9f50\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u573a\u666f\u7269\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u53cd\u5e94\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "EgoReact\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e25\u683c\u56e0\u679c\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u751f\u62103D\u5bf9\u9f50\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u5e94\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684HRD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u878d\u54083D\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u53cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u9519\u4f4d\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u4ea4\u4e92\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Building on causal transportability theory, we design an algorithm for zero-shot compositional generalization which relies on access to qualitative domain knowledge in form of a causal graph for intra-domain structure and discrepancies oracle for inter-domain mechanism sharing. \\textit{Circuit-TR} learns a collection of modules (i.e., local predictors) from the source data, and transport/compose them to obtain a circuit for prediction in the target domain if the causal structure licenses. Furthermore, circuit transportability enables us to design a supervised domain adaptation scheme that operates without access to an explicit causal structure, and instead uses limited target data. Our theoretical results characterize classes of few-shot learnable tasks in terms of graphical circuit transportability criteria, and connects few-shot generalizability with the established notion of circuit size complexity; controlled simulations corroborate our theoretical results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u53ef\u4f20\u8f93\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u548c\u673a\u5236\u5171\u4eab\u5224\u522b\u5668\u7b49\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u6e90\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5c40\u90e8\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u6761\u4ef6\u65f6\u5c06\u5176\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u57df\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u57df\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u6570\u636e\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0e\u7535\u8def\u53ef\u4f20\u8f93\u6027\u51c6\u5219\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u7535\u8def\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u5165\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u9886\u57df\u95f4\u673a\u5236\u5171\u4eab\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u53ef\u4f20\u8f93\u6027\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1Circuit-TR\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u523b\u753b\u57df\u5185\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5dee\u5f02\u5224\u522b\u5668\u8bc6\u522b\u57df\u95f4\u673a\u5236\u5171\u4eab\u60c5\u51b5\uff1b\u5b66\u4e60\u6e90\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5c40\u90e8\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff08\u5373\u7535\u8def\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u4f20\u8f93\u4e0e\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7535\u8def\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6ee1\u8db3\u7535\u8def\u53ef\u4f20\u8f93\u6027\u51c6\u5219\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5177\u6709\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u7535\u8def\u89c4\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Circuit-TR\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u548c\u8de8\u57df\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Our approach consists of a signed-distance-based 2D differencing module followed by multi-view aggregation with voting and pruning, leveraging the consistent nature of 3DGS to robustly separate pre- and post-change states. We further develop a continual scene reconstruction strategy that selectively updates dynamic regions while preserving the unchanged areas.

Cameras are commonly used in combination with inertial measurement units (IMUs) in applications such as self-driving cars, smartphones, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The vertical direction of camera views can be obtained by IMU measurements. The relative pose between two cameras is reduced from 5DOF to 3DOF. We propose a new solver to estimate the 3DOF relative pose and focal length. First, we establish constraint equations from two affine correspondences when the vertical direction is known. Then, based on the properties of the equation system with nontrivial solutions, four equations can be derived. These four equations only involve two parameters: the focal length and the relative rotation angle. Finally, the polynomial eigenvalue method is utilized to solve the problem of focal length and relative rotation angle. The proposed solver is evaluated using synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that our solver performs better than the existing state-of-the-art solvers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u4eff\u5c04\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff08ACs\uff09\u548c\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u5782\u76f4\u65b9\u5411\uff08\u7531IMU\u63d0\u4f9b\uff09\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e24\u89c6\u56fe\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u59ff\u6001\uff083\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff09\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u7126\u8ddd\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e0e\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u89e3\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4ec5\u542b\u7126\u8ddd\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u65cb\u8f6c\u89d2\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u3002\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u673a\u5e38\u4e0e\u60ef\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u5355\u5143\uff08IMU\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u7531\u4e8eIMU\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u5782\u76f4\u65b9\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u76f8\u673a\u95f4\u76f8\u5bf9\u59ff\u6001\u53ef\u4ece5\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u964d\u4e3a3\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u3002\u4f46\u7126\u8ddd\u672a\u77e5\uff0c\u9700\u540c\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8be5\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5df2\u77e5\u5782\u76f4\u65b9\u5411\u5efa\u7acb\u4e24\u4e2a\u4eff\u5c04\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u7a0b\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u89e3\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4ec5\u542b\u7126\u8ddd\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u65cb\u8f6c\u89d2\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u65b9\u7a0b\uff1b\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u5782\u76f4\u65b9\u5411\u4e0b\u76843\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u76f8\u5bf9\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u7126\u8ddd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

This paper presents our preliminary study on Mixture-of-Representations (MoR), a novel, per-tensor and sub-tensor level quantization framework that dynamically analyzes a tensor's numerical properties to select between a variety of different representations. Based on the framework, we have proposed and experimented concrete algorithms that choose dynamically between FP8 and BF16 representations for both per-tensor and sub-tensor level granularities. Our universal approach is designed to preserve model quality across various quantization partition strategies and datasets. Our initial findings show that this approach can achieve state-of-the-art results with 98.38% of tensors quantized to the FP8 format. This work highlights the potential of dynamic, property-aware quantization while preserving model quality. We believe this approach can generally improve the robustness of low precision training, as demonstrated by achieving FP8 accuracies that are on par with existing approaches without the need for fine-grain partitioning, or can be used in combination with other training methods to improve the leverage of even lower precision number formats such as NVFP4.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u8868\u793a\uff08Mixture-of-Representations, MoR\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5f20\u91cf\u7ea7\u548c\u5b50\u5f20\u91cf\u7ea7\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u6570\u503c\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\uff08\u5982FP8\u4e0eBF16\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u540c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe98.38%\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u4ee5FP8\u683c\u5f0f\u91cf\u5316\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5212\u5206\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u66f4\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u683c\u5f0f\uff08\u5982NVFP4\uff09\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u52a8\u914d\u7f6e\u6216\u56fa\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5e76\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u5f20\u91cf\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMoR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u8303\u56f4\u3001\u5206\u5e03\uff09\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u5b9a\u91c7\u7528FP8\u6216BF16\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u5f20\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e0e\u5b50\u5f20\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e24\u79cd\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u6d3b\u800c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c98.38%\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u53ef\u6210\u529f\u91cf\u5316\u81f3FP8\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5206\u533a\u5373\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u66f4\u4f4e\u4f4d\u5bbd\u683c\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "MoR\u6846\u67b6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u91cf\u5316\u5728\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8d85\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing methods face two critical limitations: (1) a lack of effective mechanisms to inject multi-view information of the object into the model, leading to poor cross-view consistency, and (2) heavy reliance on fine-grained hand mesh annotations for modeling interaction occlusions. To address these challenges, we introduce ByteLoom, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework that generates realistic HOI videos with geometrically consistent object illustration, using simplified human conditioning and 3D object inputs. We first propose an RCM-cache mechanism that leverages Relative Coordinate Maps (RCM) as a universal representation to maintain object's geometry consistency and precisely control 6-DoF object transformations in the meantime. To compensate HOI dataset scarcity and leverage existing datasets, we further design a training curriculum that enhances model capabilities in a progressive style and relaxes the demand of hand mesh. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method faithfully preserves human identity and the object's multi-view geometry, while maintaining smooth motion and object manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faByteLoom\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eDiT\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684HOI\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RCM-cache\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e6-DoF\u7269\u4f53\u53d8\u6362\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7f13\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u624b\u90e8\u7f51\u683c\u6807\u6ce8\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u624b\u90e8\u7f51\u683c\u6807\u6ce8\u4f9d\u8d56\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u4ea4\u4e92\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u538b\u5668\uff08DiT\uff09\u7684ByteLoom\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1RCM-cache\u673a\u5236\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u5750\u6807\u56fe\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u4f53\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5e76\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u52366-DoF\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bfe\u7a0b\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u7cbe\u7ec6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u4eba\u4f53\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u7269\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ByteLoom\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u8868\u793a\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684HOI\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u4eba\u3001\u7535\u5546\u53ca\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Martin", "Noah Brenowitz", "Dale Durran", "Michael Pritchard"], "title": "Long-Range Distillation: Distilling 10,000 Years of Simulated Climate into Long Timestep AI Weather Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Accurate long-range weather forecasting remains a major challenge for AI models, both because errors accumulate over autoregressive rollouts and because reanalysis datasets used for training offer a limited sample of the slow modes of climate variability underpinning predictability. Most AI weather models are autoregressive, producing short lead forecasts that must be repeatedly applied to reach subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) or seasonal lead times, often resulting in instability and calibration issues. Long-timestep probabilistic models that generate long-range forecasts in a single step offer an attractive alternative, but training on the 40-year reanalysis record leads to overfitting, suggesting orders of magnitude more training data are required. We introduce long-range distillation, a method that trains a long-timestep probabilistic \"student\" model to forecast directly at long-range using a huge synthetic training dataset generated by a short-timestep autoregressive \"teacher\" model. Using the Deep Learning Earth System Model (DLESyM) as the teacher, we generate over 10,000 years of simulated climate to train distilled student models for forecasting across a range of timescales. In perfect-model experiments, the distilled models outperform climatology and approach the skill of their autoregressive teacher while replacing hundreds of autoregressive steps with a single timestep.

However, existing social navigation datasets often lack explicit reasoning supervision and exhibit highly long-tailed action distributions, limiting models' ability to learn safety-critical behaviors. To address these issues, we introduce MUSON, a multimodal dataset for short-horizon social navigation collected across diverse indoor and outdoor campus scenes. MUSON adopts a structured five-step Chain-of-Thought annotation consisting of perception, prediction, reasoning, action, and explanation, with explicit modeling of static physical constraints and a rationally balanced discrete action space. Compared to SNEI, MUSON provides consistent reasoning, action, and explanation. Benchmarking multiple state-of-the-art Small Vision Language Models on MUSON shows that Qwen2.5-VL-3B achieves the highest decision accuracy of 0.8625, demonstrating that MUSON serves as an effective and reusable benchmark for socially compliant navigation.

However, uniform goal selection often results in sample inefficiency in multi-goal settings where agents must learn a universal goal-conditioned policy. Inspired by the adaptive and structured learning processes observed in biological systems, we propose a novel Student-Teacher learning paradigm with a Temporal Variance-Driven Curriculum to accelerate Goal-Conditioned RL. In this framework, the teacher module dynamically prioritizes goals with the highest temporal variance in the policy's confidence score, parameterized by the state-action value (Q) function. The teacher provides an adaptive and focused learning signal by targeting these high-uncertainty goals, fostering continual and efficient progress.

However, in medical imaging, the key foundation lies in human anatomy, as these images directly represent the internal structures of the body, reflecting the consistency, coherence, and hierarchy of human anatomy. Yet, existing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often overlook these perspectives, limiting their ability to effectively learn anatomical features. To overcome the limitation, we built Lamps (learning anatomy from multiple perspectives via self-supervision) pre-trained on large-scale chest radiographs by harmoniously utilizing the consistency, coherence, and hierarchy of human anatomy as the supervision signal. Extensive experiments across 10 datasets evaluated through fine-tuning and emergent property analysis demonstrate Lamps' superior robustness, transferability, and clinical potential when compared to 10 baseline models. By learning from multiple perspectives, Lamps presents a unique opportunity for foundation models to develop meaningful, robust representations that are aligned with the structure of human anatomy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing methods typically address this issue by annotating potential spurious attributes, or filtering spurious features based on some empirical assumptions (e.g., simplicity of bias). However, these methods may yield unsatisfactory performance due to the intricate and elusive nature of spurious correlations in real-world data. In this paper, we propose a data-oriented approach to mitigate the spurious correlation in deep learning models. We observe that samples that are influenced by spurious features tend to exhibit a dispersed distribution in the learned feature space. This allows us to identify the presence of spurious features. Subsequently, we obtain a bias-invariant representation by neutralizing the spurious features based on a simple grouping strategy. Then, we learn a feature transformation to eliminate the spurious features by aligning with this bias-invariant representation. Finally, we update the classifier by incorporating the learned feature transformation and obtain an unbiased model. By integrating the aforementioned identifying, neutralizing, eliminating and updating procedures, we build an effective pipeline for mitigating spurious correlation.

However, existing approaches primarily focus on erasing concepts from text prompts, overlooking other input modalities that are increasingly critical in real-world applications such as image editing and personalized generation. These modalities can become attack surfaces, where erased concepts re-emerge despite defenses. To bridge this gap, we introduce M-ErasureBench, a novel multimodal evaluation framework that systematically benchmarks concept erasure methods across three input modalities: text prompts, learned embeddings, and inverted latents. For the latter two, we evaluate both white-box and black-box access, yielding five evaluation scenarios. Our analysis shows that existing methods achieve strong erasure performance against text prompts but largely fail under learned embeddings and inverted latents, with Concept Reproduction Rate (CRR) exceeding 90% in the white-box setting. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose IRECE (Inference-time Robustness Enhancement for Concept Erasure), a plug-and-play module that localizes target concepts via cross-attention and perturbs the associated latents during denoising. Experiments demonstrate that IRECE consistently restores robustness, reducing CRR by up to 40% under the most challenging white-box latent inversion scenario, while preserving visual quality. To the best of our knowledge, M-ErasureBench provides the first comprehensive benchmark of concept erasure beyond text prompts.

However, most existing models are designed for centralized settings, rendering them inapplicable in modern decentralized environments. Moreover, current federated learning approaches often suffer from poor generalization performance due to reliance on unreliable pseudo-labels, and fail to capture the latent correlations amongst heterogeneous clients. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework named Federated Multi-Task Clustering (i.e.,FMTC), which intends to learn personalized clustering models for heterogeneous clients while collaboratively leveraging their shared underlying structure in a privacy-preserving manner. More specifically, the FMTC framework is composed of two main components: client-side personalized clustering module, which learns a parameterized mapping model to support robust out-of-sample inference, bypassing the need for unreliable pseudo-labels; and server-side tensorial correlation module, which explicitly captures the shared knowledge across all clients. This is achieved by organizing all client models into a unified tensor and applying a low-rank regularization to discover their common subspace. To solve this joint optimization problem, we derive an efficient, privacy-preserving distributed algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, which decomposes the global problem into parallel local updates on clients and an aggregation step on the server. To the end, several extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed FMTC framework significantly outperforms various baseline and state-of-the-art federated clustering algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFederated Multi-Task Clustering (FMTC)\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u805a\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u805a\u7c7b\u6a21\u5757\u4e0e\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6a21\u5757\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5171\u4eab\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6316\u6398\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9690\u79c1\u5b89\u5168\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFMTC\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u7528\u4e8e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u73b0\u4ee3\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u73af\u5883\uff1b\u800c\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u5f02\u6784\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u95f4\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u53c8\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u805a\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "FMTC\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4fa7\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6620\u5c04\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6837\u672c\u5916\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f7f\u7528\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff1b\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4fa7\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6a21\u5757\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u5f20\u91cf\u5e76\u65bd\u52a0\u4f4e\u79e9\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u5171\u7528\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u66ff\u65b9\u5411\u4e58\u5b50\u6cd5\uff08ADMM\uff09\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5e76\u884c\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u805a\u5408\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86FMTC\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u548c\u4fdd\u969c\u9690\u79c1\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "FMTC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u805a\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u6316\u6398\u8de8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, their effectiveness is critically limited when combined with standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). We identify a fundamental limitation: CFG's extrapolative nature systematically pushes the sampling path off the data manifold, causing the approximation error to diverge and undermining the refinement process. To address this, we propose Guided Path Sampling (GPS), a new paradigm for iterative refinement. GPS replaces unstable extrapolation with a principled, manifold-constrained interpolation, ensuring the sampling path remains on the data manifold. We theoretically prove that this correction transforms the error series from unbounded amplification to strictly bounded, guaranteeing stability. Furthermore, we devise an optimal scheduling strategy that dynamically adjusts guidance strength, aligning semantic injection with the model's natural coarse-to-fine generation process. Extensive experiments on modern backbones like SDXL and Hunyuan-DiT show that GPS outperforms existing methods in both perceptual quality and complex prompt adherence. For instance, GPS achieves a superior ImageReward of 0.79 and HPS v2 of 0.2995 on SDXL, while improving overall semantic alignment accuracy on GenEval to 57.45%.

So far, many research works have used deep learning models to explore the complex interactions between students, questions, and skills. However, the performance of existing method is frequently limited by the long-tailed distribution and dynamic changes in the data. To address these challenges, we propose a meta-learning framework for cognitive diagnosis based on continual learning (MetaCD). This framework can alleviate the long-tailed problem by utilizing meta-learning to learn the optimal initialization state, enabling the model to achieve good accuracy on new tasks with only a small amount of data. In addition, we utilize a continual learning method named parameter protection mechanism to give MetaCD the ability to adapt to new skills or new tasks, in order to adapt to dynamic changes in data. MetaCD can not only improve the plasticity of our model on a single task, but also ensure the stability and generalization of the model on sequential tasks. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets show that MetaCD outperforms other baselines in both accuracy and generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6MetaCD\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u6570\u636e\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u83b7\u53d6\u6700\u4f18\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u65b0\u6280\u80fd\u6216\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMetaCD\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u6216\u65b0\u6280\u80fd\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMetaCD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMetaCD\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MetaCD\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5185\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u667a\u80fd\u6559\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

However, due to the irregular and non-uniform distribution of Gaussian splats in 3D space, numerous sparse regions exist, rendering many features in the hash grid invalid. This leads to redundant storage and transmission overhead. In this work, we propose a hash grid feature pruning method that identifies and prunes invalid features based on the coordinates of the input Gaussian splats, so that only the valid features are encoded. This approach reduces the storage size of the hash grid without compromising model performance, leading to improved rate-distortion performance.

JavisGPT adopts a concise encoder-LLM-decoder architecture, featuring a SyncFusion module for spatio-temporal audio-video fusion and synchrony-aware learnable queries to bridge a pretrained JAV-DiT generator. This design enables temporally coherent video-audio understanding and generation from multimodal instructions. We design an effective three-stage training pipeline consisting of multimodal pretraining, audio-video fine-tuning, and large-scale instruction-tuning, to progressively build multimodal comprehension and generation from existing vision-language models. To support this, we further construct JavisInst-Omni, a high-quality instruction dataset with over 200K GPT-4o-curated audio-video-text dialogues that span diverse and multi-level comprehension and generation scenarios. Extensive experiments on JAV comprehension and generation benchmarks show that JavisGPT outperforms existing MLLMs, particularly in complex and temporally synchronized settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "JavisGPT\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8054\u5408\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u3002\u5b83\u91c7\u7528\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u540c\u6b65\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e20\u4e07\u6761\u7531GPT-4o\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6JavisInst-Omni\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u5e8f\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8054\u5408\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u5f3a\u65f6\u5e8f\u540c\u6b65\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u8f93\u5165\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faJavisGPT\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u5f15\u5165SyncFusion\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\u7a7a\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u878d\u5408\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u540c\u6b65\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u67e5\u8be2\u4ee5\u8fde\u63a5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528JavisInst-Omni\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "JavisGPT\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u65f6\u95f4\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "JavisGPT\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Prior methods based on latent state compressibility can be invasive and unstable. We propose Multiple Token Divergence (MTD), a simple measure of computational effort defined as the KL divergence between a model's full output distribution and that of a shallow, auxiliary prediction head. MTD can be computed directly from pre-trained models with multiple prediction heads, requiring no additional training. Building on this, we introduce Divergence Steering, a novel decoding method to control the computational character of generated text. We empirically show that MTD is more effective than prior methods at distinguishing complex tasks from simple ones. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks, MTD correlates positively with problem difficulty. Lower MTD is associated with more accurate reasoning.

Traditional modular pipelines separate perception, prediction, and planning, while recent end-to-end (E2E) systems learn them jointly. Vision-language models (VLMs) further enrich this paradigm by introducing cross-modal priors and commonsense reasoning, yet current VLM-based planners face three key challenges: (i) a mismatch between discrete text reasoning and continuous control, (ii) high latency from autoregressive chain-of-thought decoding, and (iii) inefficient or non-causal planners that limit real-time deployment. We propose ColaVLA, a unified vision-language-action framework that transfers reasoning from text to a unified latent space and couples it with a hierarchical, parallel trajectory decoder. The Cognitive Latent Reasoner compresses scene understanding into compact, decision-oriented meta-action embeddings through ego-adaptive selection and only two VLM forward passes. The Hierarchical Parallel Planner then generates multi-scale, causality-consistent trajectories in a single forward pass. Together, these components preserve the generalization and interpretability of VLMs while enabling efficient, accurate and safe trajectory generation.

Supervised fine-tuning and many distillation-style objectives implicitly minimize the forward KL divergence KL(q || pi_theta), yielding stable mode-covering updates but often under-exploiting high-reward modes. In contrast, PPO-style online reinforcement learning from human feedback behaves closer to reverse KL divergence KL(pi_theta || q), enabling mode-seeking improvements but risking mode collapse. Recent anchored methods, such as ADPO, show that performing the projection in anchored coordinates can substantially improve stability, yet they typically commit to a single divergence. We introduce Alpha-Divergence Preference Optimization (APO), an anchored framework that uses Csiszar alpha-divergence to continuously interpolate between forward and reverse KL behavior within the same anchored geometry. We derive unified gradient dynamics parameterized by alpha, analyze gradient variance properties, and propose a practical reward-and-confidence-guarded alpha schedule that transitions from coverage to exploitation only when the policy is both improving and confidently calibrated. Experiments on Qwen3-1.7B with math-level3 demonstrate that APO achieves competitive performance with GRPO and GSPO baselines while maintaining training stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "APO\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u951a\u70b9\u7684alpha-\u6563\u5ea6\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u951a\u70b9\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\u8fde\u7eed\u63d2\u503c\u524d\u5411\u548c\u53cd\u5411KL\u6563\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u6a21\u5f0f\u8986\u76d6\u5230\u6a21\u5f0f\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u5e73\u7a33\u8fc7\u6e21\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u5956\u52b1-\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684alpha\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\uff0cAOP\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0eGRPO\u3001GSPO\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u5f0f\u8986\u76d6\uff08\u524d\u5411KL\uff09\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u63a2\u7d22\uff08\u53cd\u5411KL\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u4f4e\u4f30\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1bPPO\u7b49\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u4f46\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5df2\u6709\u951a\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982ADPO\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6563\u5ea6\u7c7b\u578b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u8282\u6563\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAlpha-Divergence Preference Optimization\uff08APO\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eCsiszar alpha-\u6563\u5ea6\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u951a\u70b9\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e3aalpha\u63a7\u5236\u524d\u5411\u4e0e\u53cd\u5411KL\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u63d2\u503c\u3002\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684alpha\u8c03\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u5347\u4e14\u6821\u51c6\u826f\u597d\u65f6\u624d\u9010\u6b65\u8f6c\u5411\u66f4\u6fc0\u8fdb\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728Qwen3-1.7B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAPO\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5ab2\u7f8eGRPO\u548cGSPO\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u8986\u76d6\u4e0e\u63a2\u7d22\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "APO\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u8c03\u8282\u7684alpha-\u6563\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u951a\u70b9\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u524d\u5411\u4e0e\u53cd\u5411KL\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u5f0f\u8986\u76d6\u4e0e\u6a21\u5f0f\u63a2\u7d22\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u517c\u5177\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This poses challenges for reproducible research, methodological benchmarking, and education in domains such as stress modeling, behavioral analysis, and machine learning.\n  We introduce FLOW, a synthetic longitudinal dataset designed to model daily interactions between workload, lifestyle behaviors, and wellbeing. FLOW is generated using a rule-based, feedback-driven simulation that produces coherent temporal dynamics across variables such as stress, sleep, mood, physical activity, and body weight. The dataset simulates 1{,}000 individuals over a two-year period with daily resolution and is released as a publicly available resource.\n  In addition to the static dataset, we describe a configurable data generation tool that enables reproducible experimentation under adjustable behavioral and contextual assumptions.

We propose CLIP-Joint-Detect, a simple and detector-agnostic framework that integrates CLIP-style contrastive vision-language supervision through end-to-end joint training. A lightweight parallel head projects region or grid features into the CLIP embedding space and aligns them with learnable class-specific text embeddings via InfoNCE contrastive loss and an auxiliary cross-entropy term, while all standard detection losses are optimized simultaneously. The approach applies seamlessly to both two-stage and one-stage architectures. We validate it on Pascal VOC 2007+2012 using Faster R-CNN and on the large-scale MS COCO 2017 benchmark using modern YOLO detectors (YOLOv11), achieving consistent and substantial improvements while preserving real-time inference speed.

This study focuses on single-channel electroencephalography (EEG), a practical and widely available signal for automatic sleep staging. Existing approaches face challenges such as class imbalance, limited receptive-field modeling, and insufficient interpretability. This work proposes a context-aware and interpretable framework for single-channel EEG sleep staging, with particular emphasis on improving detection of the N1 stage. Many prior models operate as black boxes with stacked layers, lacking clearly defined and interpretable feature extraction roles.The proposed model combines compact multi-scale feature extraction with temporal modeling to capture both local and long-range dependencies. To address data imbalance, especially in the N1 stage, classweighted loss functions and data augmentation are applied. EEG signals are segmented into sub-epoch chunks, and final predictions are obtained by averaging softmax probabilities across chunks, enhancing contextual representation and robustness.The proposed framework achieves an overall accuracy of 89.72% and a macro-average F1-score of 85.46%. Notably, it attains an F1- score of 61.7% for the challenging N1 stage, demonstrating a substantial improvement over previous methods on the SleepEDF datasets.

Multimodal Complexity Is Not All You Need", "comment": null, "summary": "Deep learning architectures for multimodal learning have increased in complexity, driven by the assumption that multimodal-specific methods improve performance. We challenge this assumption through a large-scale empirical study reimplementing 19 high-impact methods under standardized conditions, evaluating them across nine diverse datasets with up to 23 modalities, and testing their generalizability to new tasks beyond their original scope, including settings with missing modalities. We propose a Simple Baseline for Multimodal Learning (SimBaMM), a straightforward late-fusion Transformer architecture, and demonstrate that under standardized experimental conditions with rigorous hyperparameter tuning of all methods, more complex architectures do not reliably outperform SimBaMM. Statistical analysis indicates that more complex methods perform comparably to SimBaMM and frequently do not reliably outperform well-tuned unimodal baselines, especially in the small-data regime considered in many original studies. To support our findings, we include a case study of a recent multimodal learning method highlighting the methodological shortcomings in the literature. In addition, we provide a pragmatic reliability checklist to promote comparable, robust, and trustworthy future evaluations. In summary, we argue for a shift in focus: away from the pursuit of architectural novelty and toward methodological rigor.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9e\u73b019\u79cd\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u4e5d\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u6700\u591a23\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u5728\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u665a\u878d\u5408Transformer\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578bSimBaMM\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u8c03\u53c2\u540e\u5e76\u672a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u8be5\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u5e38\u4e0d\u5982\u8c03\u4f18\u540e\u7684\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e94\u4ece\u8ffd\u6c42\u67b6\u6784\u521b\u65b0\u8f6c\u5411\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u8ffd\u6c42\u590d\u6742\u67b6\u6784\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u6807\u51c6\u4e0b\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6311\u6218\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u91cd\u73b0\u5b9e\u73b019\u79cd\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u4e5d\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u6700\u591a23\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u7b80\u5355\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578bSimBaMM\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u665a\u878d\u5408\u7684Transformer\uff09\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u5f00\u5c55\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u68c0\u67e5\u6e05\u5355\u3002", "result": "\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5e76\u672a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u57fa\u7ebfSimBaMM\uff1b\u8bb8\u591a\u590d\u6742\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u751a\u81f3\u4e0d\u5982\u8c03\u4f18\u540e\u7684\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u67b6\u6784\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5e76\u975e\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5982\u7f3a\u4e4f\u516c\u5e73\u5bf9\u6bd4\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u67b6\u6784\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u76f2\u76ee\u8ffd\u6c42\uff0c\u8f6c\u800c\u91cd\u89c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u6bd4\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u771f\u6b63\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

Code & models are available at: https://github.com/qiangzai-lv/YOLO-IOD", "summary": "Current methods for incremental object detection (IOD) primarily rely on Faster R-CNN or DETR series detectors; however, these approaches do not accommodate the real-time YOLO detection frameworks. In this paper, we first identify three primary types of knowledge conflicts that contribute to catastrophic forgetting in YOLO-based incremental detectors: foreground-background confusion, parameter interference, and misaligned knowledge distillation. Subsequently, we introduce YOLO-IOD, a real-time Incremental Object Detection (IOD) framework that is constructed upon the pretrained YOLO-World model, facilitating incremental learning via a stage-wise parameter-efficient fine-tuning process. Specifically, YOLO-IOD encompasses three principal components: 1) Conflict-Aware Pseudo-Label Refinement (CPR), which mitigates the foreground-background confusion by leveraging the confidence levels of pseudo labels and identifying potential objects relevant to future tasks. 2) Importancebased Kernel Selection (IKS), which identifies and updates the pivotal convolution kernels pertinent to the current task during the current learning stage. 3) Cross-Stage Asymmetric Knowledge Distillation (CAKD), which addresses the misaligned knowledge distillation conflict by transmitting the features of the student target detector through the detection heads of both the previous and current teacher detectors, thereby facilitating asymmetric distillation between existing and newly introduced categories. We further introduce LoCo COCO, a more realistic benchmark that eliminates data leakage across stages. Experiments on both conventional and LoCo COCO benchmarks show that YOLO-IOD achieves superior performance with minimal forgetting.", "AI": {"tldr": "YOLO-IOD \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e YOLO-World \u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u589e\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9 YOLO \u7cfb\u5217\u5728\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u524d\u80cc\u666f\u6df7\u6dc6\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u9519\u4f4d\u7b49\u4e09\u5927\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u51b2\u7a81\u611f\u77e5\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u4f18\u5316\uff08CPR\uff09\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7684\u6838\u9009\u62e9\uff08IKS\uff09\u548c\u8de8\u9636\u6bb5\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff08CAKD\uff09\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7684 LoCo COCO \u57fa\u51c6\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u9057\u5fd8\u6781\u5c11\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u589e\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e Faster R-CNN \u6216 DETR\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u914d\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u7684 YOLO \u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u800c YOLO \u5728\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u524d\u80cc\u666f\u6df7\u6dc6\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u9519\u4f4d\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa YOLO-IOD \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1\uff09\u51b2\u7a81\u611f\u77e5\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u4f18\u5316\uff08CPR\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7f13\u89e3\u524d\u80cc\u666f\u6df7\u6dc6\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7684\u6838\u9009\u62e9\uff08IKS\uff09\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u66f4\u65b0\u5f53\u524d\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u6838\uff1b3\uff09\u8de8\u9636\u6bb5\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff08CAKD\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u5934\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b0\u65e7\u7c7b\u522b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f20\u9012\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa LoCo COCO \u57fa\u51c6\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8bc4\u4f30\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 LoCo COCO \u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cYOLO-IOD \u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "YOLO-IOD \u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e YOLO \u7684\u589e\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5173\u952e\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Current Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) continual learning techniques often retain and freeze previously learned LoRAs or generate data representations to overcome forgetting, typically utilizing these to support new LoRAs learn new tasks. However, these methods not only ignore growing computational memory with tasks and limited storage space but also suffer from potential task interference due to the lack of effective LoRA merging mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a novel continual learning method that orthogonally initializes and sequentially merges LoRAs updates into a single unified LoRA. Our method leverages orthogonal basis extraction from previously learned LoRA to initialize the learning of new tasks, further exploits the intrinsic asymmetry property of LoRA components by using a time-aware scaling mechanism to balance new and old knowledge during continual merging. Our approach maintains constant memory complexity with respect to the number of tasks, minimizes interference between past and new tasks via orthogonal basis initialization, and improves performance over asymmetric LoRA merging via adaptive scaling. We provide theoretical analysis to justify our design and conduct extensive experiments across diverse continual learning benchmarks using various Llama models, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u5408\u5e76LoRA\u66f4\u65b0\u5230\u5355\u4e00\u7edf\u4e00\u7684LoRA\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u5148\u524d\u5b66\u5230\u7684LoRA\u63d0\u53d6\u6b63\u4ea4\u57fa\u6765\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7f29\u653e\u673a\u5236\u5e73\u8861\u65b0\u65e7\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6052\u5b9a\u5185\u5b58\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\uff08LoRA\uff09\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u51bb\u7ed3\u5148\u524d\u7684LoRA\u6216\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8868\u793a\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u5185\u5b58\u968f\u4efb\u52a1\u589e\u52a0\u3001\u5b58\u50a8\u7a7a\u95f4\u6709\u9650\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548LoRA\u5408\u5e76\u673a\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6b63\u4ea4\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5e76\u987a\u5e8f\u5408\u5e76LoRA\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5148\u524dLoRA\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u57fa\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7f29\u653e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u65b0\u65e7\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684LoRA\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u5185\u5b58\u6052\u5b9a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cdLlama\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u4efb\u52a1\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u878d\u5408\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5e38\u6570\u5185\u5b58\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

To address these limitations, we propose ReamCamo, a unified out-painting based framework for realistic camouflaged image generation. ReamCamo explicitly introduces additional layout controls to regulate global image structure, thereby improving semantic coherence between foreground objects and generated backgrounds. Moreover, we construct a multi-modal textual-visual condition by combining a unified fine-grained textual task description with texture-oriented background retrieval, which jointly guides the generation process to enhance visual fidelity and realism.

While event cameras offer a promising solution due to their high temporal resolution, current 6DoF pose estimation methods typically yield suboptimal performance in high-speed object moving scenarios. To address this gap, we propose PoseStreamer, a robust multi-modal 6DoF pose estimation framework designed specifically on high-speed moving scenarios. Our approach integrates three core components: an Adaptive Pose Memory Queue that utilizes historical orientation cues for temporal consistency, an Object-centric 2D Tracker that provides strong 2D priors to boost 3D center recall, and a Ray Pose Filter for geometric refinement along camera rays. Furthermore, we introduce MoCapCube6D, a novel multi-modal dataset constructed to benchmark performance under rapid motion.

However, existing multi-operator learning approaches are data-hungry and neglect physics during training. Here, we propose a physics-informed multimodal foundation model (PI-MFM) framework that directly enforces governing equations during pretraining and adaptation. PI-MFM takes symbolic representations of PDEs as the input, and automatically assembles PDE residual losses from the input expression via a vectorized derivative computation. These designs enable any PDE-encoding multimodal foundation model to be trained or adapted with unified physics-informed objectives across equation families. On a benchmark of 13 parametric one-dimensional time-dependent PDE families, PI-MFM consistently outperforms purely data-driven counterparts, especially with sparse labeled spatiotemporal points, partially observed time domains, or few labeled function pairs. Physics losses further improve robustness against noise, and simple strategies such as resampling collocation points substantially improve accuracy. We also analyze the accuracy, precision, and computational cost of automatic differentiation and finite differences for derivative computation within PI-MFM. Finally, we demonstrate zero-shot physics-informed fine-tuning to unseen PDE families: starting from a physics-informed pretrained model, adapting using only PDE residuals and initial/boundary conditions, without any labeled solution data, rapidly reduces test errors to around 1% and clearly outperforms physics-only training from scratch.

However, current methods have two key bottlenecks. On one hand, they struggle to process diagnostic and descriptive texts simultaneously, making it difficult to identify lesions and establish associations with image regions. On the other hand, existing approaches focus on lesions description and fail to capture positional constraints, leading to critical deviations. Specifically, with the text \"in the left lower lung\", the segmentation results may incorrectly cover both sides of the lung. To address the limitations, we propose the Spatial-aware Symmetric Alignment (SSA) framework to enhance the capacity of referring hybrid medical texts consisting of locational, descriptive, and diagnostic information. Specifically, we propose symmetric optimal transport alignment mechanism to strengthen the associations between image regions and multiple relevant expressions, which establishes bi-directional fine-grained multimodal correspondences. In addition, we devise a composite directional guidance strategy that explicitly introduces spatial constraints in the text by constructing region-level guidance masks. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that SSA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, particularly in accurately segmenting lesions characterized by spatial relational constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSpatial-aware Symmetric Alignment (SSA)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u533b\u7597\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4e24\u5927\u74f6\u9888\uff1a\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0e\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7ea6\u675f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5206\u5272\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u79f0\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\u4e0e\u591a\u8868\u8fbe\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u590d\u5408\u65b9\u5411\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u751f\u6210\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a9\u7801\u3002\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSSA\u5728\u5177\u6709\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u75c5\u7076\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0e\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u6587\u672c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u679c\u51fa\u73b0\u5173\u952e\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5982\u5c06\u5de6\u53f3\u80ba\u5747\u9519\u8bef\u8986\u76d6\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u79cd\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u7cbe\u786e\u6355\u6349\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u79f0\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\u4e0e\u591a\u8868\u8fbe\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u5e94\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u590d\u5408\u65b9\u5411\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a9\u7801\u663e\u5f0f\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u533b\u7597\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cSSA\u5b9e\u73b0\u9886\u5148\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u75c5\u7076\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SSA\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u533b\u7597\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, existing prompt-based methods for removing or modifying identity-specific features rely either on the subject being well-represented in the pre-trained model or require model fine-tuning for specific identities. In this work, we analyze the identity generation process and introduce a reverse personalization framework for face anonymization. Our approach leverages conditional diffusion inversion, allowing direct manipulation of images without using text prompts. To generalize beyond subjects in the model's training data, we incorporate an identity-guided conditioning branch. Unlike prior anonymization methods, which lack control over facial attributes, our framework supports attribute-controllable anonymization. We demonstrate that our method achieves a state-of-the-art balance between identity removal, attribute preservation, and image quality.

However, their deployment with federated learning (FL) faces two critical challenges: 1) resource-constrained edge devices cannot store full expert sets, and 2) non-IID data distributions cause severe expert load imbalance that degrades model performance. To this end, we propose \\textbf{FLEX-MoE}, a novel federated MoE framework that jointly optimizes expert assignment and load balancing under limited client capacity. Specifically, our approach introduces client-expert fitness scores that quantify the expert suitability for local datasets through training feedback, and employs an optimization-based algorithm to maximize client-expert specialization while enforcing balanced expert utilization system-wide.

Existing methods rely on a pre-defined Object Lookup Table (OLT) to query Visual Language Models (VLMs) for reasoning about object locations, which limits the applications in scenarios with undefined or unforeseen targets. To address this problem, we present OpenGround, a novel zero-shot framework for open-world 3D visual grounding. Central to OpenGround is the Active Cognition-based Reasoning (ACR) module, which is designed to overcome the fundamental limitation of pre-defined OLTs by progressively augmenting the cognitive scope of VLMs. The ACR module performs human-like perception of the target via a cognitive task chain and actively reasons about contextually relevant objects, thereby extending VLM cognition through a dynamically updated OLT. This allows OpenGround to function with both pre-defined and open-world categories. We also propose a new dataset named OpenTarget, which contains over 7000 object-description pairs to evaluate our method in open-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OpenGround achieves competitive performance on Nr3D, state-of-the-art on ScanRefer, and delivers a substantial 17.6% improvement on OpenTarget.

When $\u03c0_{\\text{roll}} \\ne \u03c0_\u03b8$, there is approximation error between the surrogate and the true objective. Prior work has shown that this off-policy mismatch is unavoidable in modern LLM-RL due to implementation divergence, mixture-of-experts routing discontinuities, and distributed training staleness. Classical trust region bounds on the resulting error scale as $O(T^2)$ with sequence length $T$, rendering them vacuous for long-horizon tasks. We derive two tighter bounds: a Pinsker-Marginal bound scaling as $O(T^{3/2})$ and a Mixed bound scaling as $O(T)$. Crucially, both bounds depend on $D_{kl}^{tok,max}$ -- the maximum token-level KL divergence across all positions in a sequence. This is inherently a sequence-level quantity: it requires examining the entire trajectory to compute, and therefore cannot be controlled by token-independent methods like PPO clipping. We propose Trust Region Masking (TRM), which excludes entire sequences from gradient computation if any token violates the trust region, providing the first non-vacuous monotonic improvement guarantees for long-horizon LLM-RL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57df\u63a9\u7801\uff08TRM\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u56e0\u7b56\u7565\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u8bef\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57df\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u56e0\u8bef\u5dee\u968f\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u5e73\u65b9\u589e\u957f\u800c\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff08\u5206\u522b\u4e3aO(T^{3/2})\u548cO(T)\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u8bcd\u5143\u7ea7KL\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5c4f\u853d\u8fdd\u53cd\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u5e8f\u5217\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u6539\u8fdb\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u8def\u7531\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u53ca\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u7b56\u7565\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u7684\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\u7ecf\u5178\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57df\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u968f\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u5e73\u65b9\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d8\u5f97\u65e0\u6548\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0a\u754c\uff1aPinsker-Marginal\u754c\uff08O(T^{3/2})\uff09\u548cMixed\u754c\uff08O(T)\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6700\u5927\u8bcd\u5143\u7ea7KL\u6563\u5ea6 $D_{kl}^{tok,max}$\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57df\u63a9\u7801\uff08TRM\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f53\u4efb\u610f\u8bcd\u5143\u8d85\u51fa\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57df\u65f6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u6392\u9664\u6574\u6761\u5e8f\u5217\u53c2\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "TRM\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u6539\u8fdb\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6PPO\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u6027\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u8bef\u5dee\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684TRM\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We prove this mismatch has an asymmetric effect: the bound on log-probability mismatch scales as $(1-p)$ where $p$ is the token probability. For high-probability tokens, this bound vanishes, contributing negligibly to sequence-level mismatch. For low-probability tokens in the tail, the bound remains large, and moreover, when sampled, these tokens exhibit systematically biased mismatches that accumulate over sequences, destabilizing gradient estimation. Rather than applying post-hoc corrections, we propose constraining the RL objective to a dynamically-pruned ``safe'' vocabulary that excludes the extreme tail. By pruning such tokens, we trade large, systematically biased mismatches for a small, bounded optimization bias. Empirically, our method achieves stable training; theoretically, we bound the optimization bias introduced by vocabulary pruning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3-\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u7531\u4e8e\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u7cbe\u786e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u8be5\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5177\u6709\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff1a\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u8bcd\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\uff0c\u800c\u4f4e\u6982\u7387\u8bcd\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7d2f\u79ef\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u4fee\u526a\u2018\u5b89\u5168\u2019\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\uff0c\u6392\u9664\u6781\u7aef\u5c3e\u90e8\u8bcd\u6c47\uff0c\u4ee5\u727a\u7272\u5c0f\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u504f\u5dee\u6362\u53d6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e5f\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u504f\u5dee\u53ef\u63a7\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e4b\u95f4\u6570\u503c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4f4e\u6982\u7387\u8bcd\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u4fee\u526a\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u4fdd\u7559\u2018\u5b89\u5168\u2019\u8bcd\u6c47\uff0c\u6392\u9664\u4f4e\u6982\u7387\u5c3e\u90e8\u8bcd\u6c47\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e14\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u4fee\u526a\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u504f\u5dee\u662f\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4fee\u526a\u6781\u7aef\u5c3e\u90e8\u8bcd\u6c47\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8bad\u7ec3-\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose Co2S, a stable semi-supervised RS segmentation framework that synergistically fuses priors from vision-language models and self-supervised models. Specifically, we construct a heterogeneous dual-student architecture comprising two distinct ViT-based vision foundation models initialized with pretrained CLIP and DINOv3 to mitigate error accumulation and pseudo-label drift. To effectively incorporate these distinct priors, an explicit-implicit semantic co-guidance mechanism is introduced that utilizes text embeddings and learnable queries to provide explicit and implicit class-level guidance, respectively, thereby jointly enhancing semantic consistency. Furthermore, a global-local feature collaborative fusion strategy is developed to effectively fuse the global contextual information captured by CLIP with the local details produced by DINOv3, enabling the model to generate highly precise segmentation results. Extensive experiments on six popular datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, which consistently achieves leading performance across various partition protocols and diverse scenarios.

Uniform Convergence Bounds for Generative & Vision-Language Models under Low-Dimensional Structure", "comment": "13 pages, 2 figures", "summary": "Modern generative and vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in scientific and medical decision support, where predicted probabilities must be both accurate and well calibrated. Despite strong empirical results with moderate data, it remains unclear when such predictions generalize uniformly across inputs, classes, or subpopulations, rather than only on average-a critical issue in biomedicine, where rare conditions and specific groups can exhibit large errors even when overall loss is low.\n  We study this question from a finite-sample perspective and ask: under what structural assumptions can generative and VLM-based predictors achieve uniformly accurate and calibrated behavior with practical sample sizes? Rather than analyzing arbitrary parameterizations, we focus on induced families of classifiers obtained by varying prompts or semantic embeddings within a restricted representation space. When model outputs depend smoothly on a low-dimensional semantic representation-an assumption supported by spectral structure in text and joint image-text embeddings-classical uniform convergence tools yield meaningful non-asymptotic guarantees.\n  Our main results give finite-sample uniform convergence bounds for accuracy and calibration functionals of VLM-induced classifiers under Lipschitz stability with respect to prompt embeddings. The implied sample complexity depends on intrinsic/effective dimension, not ambient embedding dimension, and we further derive spectrum-dependent bounds that make explicit how eigenvalue decay governs data requirements. We conclude with implications for data-limited biomedical modeling, including when current dataset sizes can support uniformly reliable predictions and why average calibration metrics may miss

Current generative models typically operate in the global pixel domain or rely on binary masks, these paradigms often suffer from feature entanglement, leading to corrupted anatomical substrates or structural discontinuities. PathoSyn addresses these limitations by decomposing the synthesis task into deterministic anatomical reconstruction and stochastic deviation modeling. Central to our framework is a Deviation-Space Diffusion Model designed to learn the conditional distribution of pathological residuals, thereby capturing localized intensity variations while preserving global structural integrity by construction. To ensure spatial coherence, the diffusion process is coupled with a seam-aware fusion strategy and an inference-time stabilization module, which collectively suppress boundary artifacts and produce high-fidelity internal lesion heterogeneity. PathoSyn provides a mathematically principled pipeline for generating high-fidelity patient-specific synthetic datasets, facilitating the development of robust diagnostic algorithms in low-data regimes. By allowing interpretable counterfactual disease progression modeling, the framework supports precision intervention planning and provides a controlled environment for benchmarking clinical decision-support systems. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on tumor imaging benchmarks demonstrate that PathoSyn significantly outperforms holistic diffusion and mask-conditioned baselines in both perceptual realism and anatomical fidelity.

Some previous methods have shown substantial improvements by either employing heterogeneous teacher models to provide high-quality pseudo labels or enforcing feature-perspective consistency between the teacher and student networks. However, these methods overlook the fact that the model usually tends to exhibit low sensitivity to object geometries with limited labeled data, making it difficult to capture geometric information, which is crucial for enhancing the student model's ability in object perception and localization. In this paper, we propose GeoTeacher to enhance the student model's ability to capture geometric relations of objects with limited training data, especially unlabeled data. We design a keypoint-based geometric relation supervision module that transfers the teacher model's knowledge of object geometry to the student, thereby improving the student's capability in understanding geometric relations. Furthermore, we introduce a voxel-wise data augmentation strategy that increases the diversity of object geometries, thereby further improving the student model's ability to comprehend geometric structures. To preserve the integrity of distant objects during augmentation, we incorporate a distance-decay mechanism into this strategy. Moreover, GeoTeacher can be combined with different SS3D methods to further improve their performance. Extensive experiments on the ONCE and Waymo datasets indicate the effectiveness and generalization of our method and we achieve the new state-of-the-art results.

Even in tasks with abundant strong signals, the key to improving model performance often lies in effectively extracting weak signals. However, the lack of dedicated datasets has long constrained research. To address this, we construct the first specialized dataset for weak signal feature learning, containing 13,158 spectral samples. It features low SNR dominance (over 55% samples with SNR below 50) and extreme class imbalance (class ratio up to 29:1), providing a challenging benchmark for classification and regression in weak signal scenarios. We also propose a dual-view representation (vector + time-frequency map) and a PDVFN model tailored to low SNR, distribution skew, and dual imbalance. PDVFN extracts local sequential features and global frequency-domain structures in parallel, following principles of local enhancement, sequential modeling, noise suppression, multi-scale capture, frequency extraction, and global perception. This multi-source complementarity enhances representation for low-SNR and imbalanced data, offering a novel solution for WSL tasks like astronomical spectroscopy. Experiments show our method achieves higher accuracy and robustness in handling weak signals, high noise, and extreme class imbalance, especially in low SNR and imbalanced scenarios. This study provides a dedicated dataset, a baseline model, and establishes a foundation for future WSL research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5f31\u4fe1\u53f7\u5b66\u4e60\uff08WSL\uff09\u4e2d\u56e0\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u5bfc\u81f4\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u5f31\u4fe1\u53f7\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b13,158\u4e2a\u5149\u8c31\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\uff08\u8d8555%\u6837\u672cSNR\u4f4e\u4e8e50\uff09\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe29:1\uff09\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u89c6\u56fe\u8868\u793a\uff08\u5411\u91cf+\u65f6\u9891\u56fe\uff09\u4e0e\u4e13\u4e3a\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u659c\u548c\u53cc\u91cd\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684PDVFN\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u884c\u63d0\u53d6\u5c40\u90e8\u5e8f\u5217\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u9891\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u6291\u5236\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6355\u6349\u3001\u9891\u7387\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u611f\u77e5\u7b49\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6e90\u4e92\u8865\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f31\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u53ca\u6781\u7aef\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5929\u6587\u5149\u8c31\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765WSL\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f31\u4fe1\u53f7\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u4fe1\u53f7\u88ab\u566a\u58f0\u63a9\u76d6\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u56f0\u96be\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u3001\u6781\u7aef\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u89c6\u56fe\u8868\u793a\uff08\u5411\u91cf+\u65f6\u9891\u56fe\uff09\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1PDVFN\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\u5c40\u90e8\u5e8f\u5217\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u9891\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u6291\u5236\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6355\u6349\u3001\u9891\u7387\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u611f\u77e5\u7b49\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5f31\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u3001\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u53ca\u6781\u7aef\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u66f4\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5f31\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5f31\u4fe1\u53f7\u5b66\u4e60\u4e13\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578bPDVFN\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5f31\u4fe1\u53f7\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u4e0e\u6280\u672f\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, most existing evaluation methods rely on coarse-grained metrics or static QA pipelines, which lack fine-grained interpretability and struggle to reflect human preferences. To address this, we propose REVEALER, a unified framework for element-level alignment evaluation based on reinforcement-guided visual reasoning. Adopting a structured \"grounding-reasoning-conclusion\" paradigm, our method enables Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to explicitly localize semantic elements and derive interpretable alignment judgments.

Existing image-based approaches face two critical challenges: methods achieving high accuracy typically require dense 3D supervision, while those operating without such supervision struggle to extract accurate geometry from images alone. In this paper, we present GVSynergy-Det, a novel framework that enhances 3D detection through synergistic Gaussian-Voxel representation learning. Our key insight is that continuous Gaussian and discrete voxel representations capture complementary geometric information: Gaussians excel at modeling fine-grained surface details while voxels provide structured spatial context. We introduce a dual-representation architecture that: 1) adapts generalizable Gaussian Splatting to extract complementary geometric features for detection tasks, and 2) develops a cross-representation enhancement mechanism that enriches voxel features with geometric details from Gaussian fields. Unlike previous methods that either rely on time-consuming per-scene optimization or utilize Gaussian representations solely for depth regularization, our synergistic strategy directly leverages features from both representations through learnable integration, enabling more accurate object localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GVSynergy-Det achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging indoor benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing methods on both ScanNetV2 and ARKitScenes datasets, all without requiring any depth or dense 3D geometry supervision (e.g., point clouds or TSDF).", "AI": {"tldr": "GVSynergy-Det\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u534f\u540c\u9ad8\u65af-\u4f53\u7d20\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u56fe\u50cf3D\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8fde\u7eed\u9ad8\u65af\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u4f53\u7d20\u8868\u793a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u6355\u6349\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8868\u9762\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u76843D\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u6df1\u5ea6\u6216\u5bc6\u96c63D\u51e0\u4f55\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5728ScanNetV2\u548cARKitScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf3D\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bc6\u96c63D\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u63d0\u53d6\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u56fe\u50cf3D\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u8868\u793a\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u901a\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\u9635\uff08Gaussian Splatting\uff09\u9002\u914d\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u4e92\u8865\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8de8\u8868\u793a\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\u4e30\u5bcc\u4f53\u7d20\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\u76f4\u63a5\u6574\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f9d\u8d56\u9010\u573a\u666f\u4f18\u5316\u6216\u4ec5\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728ScanNetV2\u548cARKitScenes\u4e24\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u6027\u5ba4\u5185\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u4f55\u6df1\u5ea6\u6216\u5bc6\u96c63D\u51e0\u4f55\u76d1\u7763\uff08\u5982\u70b9\u4e91\u6216TSDF\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "GVSynergy-Det\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u4e0e\u4f53\u7d20\u8868\u793a\u7684\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf3D\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56fe\u50cf3D\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

First, we demonstrate that structural variants, such as DoRA, AdaLoRA, and MiSS, consistently outperform LoRA. Second, we uncover a spectral collapse phenomenon in SVD-informed initialization strategies (\\textit{e.g.,} PiSSA, MiLoRA), attributing their failure to a fundamental misalignment between principal-component updates and RL optimization. Furthermore, our ablations reveal that extreme parameter reduction (\\textit{e.g.,} VeRA, Rank-1) severely bottlenecks reasoning capacity.

However, existing DWMs lack 3D scene understanding capabilities and can only generate content conditioned on input data, without the ability to interpret or reason about the driving environment. Moreover, current approaches represent 3D spatial information with point cloud or BEV features do not accurately align textual information with the underlying 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified DWM framework based on 3D Gaussian scene representation, which enables both 3D scene understanding and multi-modal scene generation, while also enabling contextual enrichment for understanding and generation tasks. Our approach directly aligns textual information with the 3D scene by embedding rich linguistic features into each Gaussian primitive, thereby achieving early modality alignment. In addition, we design a novel task-aware language-guided sampling strategy that removes redundant 3D Gaussians and injects accurate and compact 3D tokens into LLM. Furthermore, we design a dual-condition multi-modal generation model, where the information captured by our vision-language model is leveraged as a high-level language condition in combination with a low-level image condition, jointly guiding the multi-modal generation process. We conduct comprehensive studies on the nuScenes, and NuInteract datasets to validate the effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

The study explores several DL models, including UNet, UNet++, ResUNet, AttentionUNet, and ResNet50-Segnet, applied to high-resolution Sentinel-2 Level 2A satellite images of the Amazon Rainforest. The datasets comprise three collections: two sets of three-band imagery and one set of four-band imagery. After evaluation, the most effective DL models are individually integrated with the OBIA technique to enhance mapping accuracy. The originality of this work lies in evaluating different deep learning models combined with OBIA and comparing them with traditional OBIA methods. The results show that the proposed ForCM method improves forest cover mapping, achieving overall accuracies of 94.54 percent with ResUNet-OBIA and 95.64 percent with AttentionUNet-OBIA, compared to 92.91 percent using traditional OBIA.

The standard algorithm, Online Newton Step (ONS), balances statistical optimality and computational practicality, guaranteeing an optimal regret of $O(d \\log T)$, where $d$ is the dimension and $T$ is the time horizon. ONS faces a computational bottleneck due to the Mahalanobis projections at each round. This step costs $\u03a9(d^\u03c9)$ arithmetic operations for bounded domains, even for the unit ball, where $\u03c9\\in (2,3]$ is the matrix-multiplication exponent. As a result, the total runtime can reach $\\tilde{O}(d^\u03c9T)$, particularly when iterates frequently oscillate near the domain boundary. For Stochastic eXp-concave Optimization (SXO), computational cost is also a challenge. Deploying ONS with online-to-batch conversion for SXO requires $T = \\tilde{O}(d/\u03b5)$ rounds to achieve an excess risk of $\u03b5$, and thereby necessitates an $\\tilde{O}(d^{\u03c9+1}/\u03b5)$ runtime. A COLT'13 open problem posed by Koren [2013] asks for an SXO algorithm with runtime less than $\\tilde{O}(d^{\u03c9+1}/\u03b5)$.\n  This paper proposes a simple variant of ONS, LightONS, which reduces the total runtime to $O(d^2 T + d^\u03c9\\sqrt{T \\log T})$ while preserving the optimal $O(d \\log T)$ regret. LightONS implies an SXO method with runtime $\\tilde{O}(d^3/\u03b5)$, thereby answering the open problem. Importantly, LightONS preserves the elegant structure of ONS by leveraging domain-conversion techniques from parameter-free online learning to introduce a hysteresis mechanism that delays expensive Mahalanobis projections until necessary. This design enables LightONS to serve as an efficient plug-in replacement of ONS in broader scenarios, even beyond regret minimization, including gradient-norm adaptive regret, parametric stochastic bandits, and memory-efficient online learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLightONS\u7684ONS\u7b80\u5316\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5728\u7ebfeXp-\u51f9\u4f18\u5316\uff08OXO\uff09\u548c\u968f\u673aeXp-\u51f9\u4f18\u5316\uff08SXO\uff09\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002LightONS\u5c06\u603b\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece$\\tilde{O}(d^\u03c9T)$\u964d\u4f4e\u81f3$O(d^2 T + d^\u03c9\\sqrt{T \\log T})$\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u4f18\u7684$O(d \\log T)$\u540e\u6094\u7387\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6ede\u540e\u673a\u5236\uff08hysteresis\uff09\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u5fc5\u8981\u65f6\u6267\u884c\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u9a6c\u54c8\u62c9\u8bfa\u6bd4\u65af\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8eSXO\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a$\\tilde{O}(d^3/\u03b5)$\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86COLT'13\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u4f4e\u4e8e$\\tilde{O}(d^{\u03c9+1}/\u03b5)$\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cLightONS\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86ONS\u7684\u7b80\u6d01\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68af\u5ea6\u8303\u6570\u540e\u6094\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u968f\u673a\u591a\u81c2\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u7684Online Newton Step\uff08ONS\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u7684$O(d \\log T)$\u540e\u6094\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u6bcf\u8f6e\u9700\u8fdb\u884c\u4ee3\u4ef7\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u9a6c\u54c8\u62c9\u8bfa\u6bd4\u65af\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u603b\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u9ad8\u8fbe$\\tilde{O}(d^\u03c9T)$\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8fed\u4ee3\u9891\u7e41\u9760\u8fd1\u8fb9\u754c\u65f6\u66f4\u4e3a\u4e25\u91cd\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\uff08SXO\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528ONS\u7ed3\u5408online-to-batch\u8f6c\u6362\u9700\u8981$T = \\\\tilde{O}(d/\u03b5)$\u8f6e\u6b21\u624d\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230$\\\\varepsilon$\u7684\u8fc7\u91cf\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9020\u6210$\\tilde{O}(d^{\u03c9+1}/\u03b5)$\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u8fdc\u8d85\u5b9e\u9645\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7edf\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u53c8\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u4f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3COLT'13\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLightONS\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u65e0\u5173\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u57df\u53d8\u6362\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u6ede\u540e\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u4ec5\u5f53\u5f53\u524d\u70b9\u8fdc\u79bb\u57df\u8fb9\u754c\u4e14\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u65f6\u624d\u6267\u884c\u8017\u65f6\u7684\u9a6c\u54c8\u62c9\u8bfa\u6bd4\u65af\u6295\u5f71\u3002\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6295\u5f71\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u539fONS\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u540e\u6094\u754c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u540e\u6094\u7387\u4e3a$O(d \\log T)$\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "LightONS\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6700\u4f18$O(d \\log T)$\u540e\u6094\u7387\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c06\u603b\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u964d\u4f4e\u81f3$O(d^2 T + d^\u03c9\\sqrt{T \\log T})$\uff1b\u5728\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0$\\tilde{O}(d^3/\u03b5)$\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e4b\u524d\u7684$\\tilde{O}(d^{\u03c9+1}/\u03b5)$\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u56de\u7b54\u4e86COLT'13\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u5747\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6269\u5c55\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5982\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68af\u5ea6\u8303\u6570\u540e\u6094\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u591a\u81c2\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "conclusion": "LightONS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u90e8\u7f72\u7684ONS\u66ff\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5de7\u5999\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6ede\u540e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002\u5b83\u4e0d\u4ec5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u5728\u7ebf\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

Current diffusion model-based applications exploit the power of learned visual representations from multistep forward-backward Markovian processes for single-task prediction tasks by attaching a task-specific decoder. However, the heuristic selection of diffusion timestep features still heavily relies on empirical intuition, often leading to sub-optimal performance biased towards certain tasks. To alleviate this constraint, we investigate the significance of versatile diffusion timestep features by adaptively selecting timesteps best suited for the few-shot dense prediction task, evaluated on an arbitrary unseen task. To this end, we propose two modules: Task-aware Timestep Selection (TTS) to select ideal diffusion timesteps based on timestep-wise losses and similarity scores, and Timestep Feature Consolidation (TFC) to consolidate the selected timestep features to improve the dense predictive performance in a few-shot setting. Accompanied by our parameter-efficient fine-tuning adapter, our framework effectively achieves superiority in dense prediction performance given only a few support queries. We empirically validate our learnable timestep consolidation method on the large-scale challenging Taskonomy dataset for dense prediction, particularly for practical universal and few-shot learning scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5bc6\u96c6\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u9009\u62e9\uff08TTS\uff09\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7279\u5f81\u6574\u5408\uff08TFC\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u9009\u53d6\u6700\u4f18\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728Taskonomy\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u901a\u7528\u4e0e\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bc6\u96c6\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u4e14\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u9009\u62e9\uff08TTS\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5f97\u5206\u7b5b\u9009\u6700\u4f18\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7279\u5f81\u6574\u5408\uff08TFC\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u9009\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5bc6\u96c6\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Taskonomy\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u672a\u89c1\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5bc6\u96c6\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u6574\u5408\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5bc6\u96c6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Furthermore, PGOT dynamically routes computations to low-order linear paths for smooth regions and high-order non-linear paths for shock waves and discontinuities based on spatial coordinates, enabling spatially adaptive and high-precision physical field modeling.

However, graph data often exhibits overlap among different clients. Previous research has demonstrated certain benefits of overlapping data in mitigating data heterogeneity. However, the negative effects have not been explored, particularly in cases where the overlaps are imbalanced across clients. In this paper, we uncover the unfairness issue arising from imbalanced overlapping subgraphs through both empirical observations and theoretical reasoning. To address this issue, we propose FairGFL (FAIRness-aware subGraph Federated Learning), a novel algorithm that enhances cross-client fairness while maintaining model utility in a privacy-preserving manner. Specifically, FairGFL incorporates an interpretable weighted aggregation approach to enhance fairness across clients, leveraging privacy-preserving estimation of their overlapping ratios. Furthermore, FairGFL improves the tradeoff between model utility and fairness by integrating a carefully crafted regularizer into the federated composite loss function.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel Holistic Detection Transformer (Holi-DETR) that detects fashion items in outfit images holistically, by leveraging contextual information. Fashion items often have meaningful relationships as they are combined to create specific styles. Unlike conventional detectors that detect each item independently, Holi-DETR detects multiple items while reducing ambiguities by leveraging three distinct types of contextual information: (1) the co-occurrence relationship between fashion items, (2) the relative position and size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) the spatial relationships between items and human body key-points. %Holi-DETR explicitly incorporates three types of contextual information: (1) the co-occurrence probability between fashion items, (2) the relative position and size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) the spatial relationships between items and human body key-points. To this end, we propose a novel architecture that integrates these three types of heterogeneous contextual information into the Detection Transformer (DETR) and its subsequent models. In experiments, the proposed methods improved the performance of the vanilla DETR and the more recently developed Co-DETR by 3.6 percent points (pp) and 1.1 pp, respectively, in terms of average precision (AP).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u53d8\u538b\u5668\uff08Holi-DETR\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u5c1a\u5355\u54c1\u5728\u670d\u88c5\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u65f6\u5c1a\u5355\u54c1\u5916\u89c2\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u5b50\u7c7b\u522b\u95f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u9ad8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u6d4b\u56f0\u96be\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u72ec\u7acb\u68c0\u6d4b\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5355\u54c1\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u5176\u7ec4\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u7efc\u5408\u8003\u8651\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "Holi-DETR\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e09\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u2014\u2014\u5355\u54c1\u95f4\u7684\u5171\u73b0\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u5355\u54c1\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u5927\u5c0f\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5355\u54c1\u4e0e\u4eba\u4f53\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f02\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5165\u68c0\u6d4b\u53d8\u538b\u5668\uff08DETR\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a\u5355\u54c1\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cHoli-DETR\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u539f\u59cbDETR\u63d0\u5347\u4e863.6\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08AP\uff09\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8eCo-DETR\u63d0\u5347\u4e861.1\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5728\u65f6\u5c1a\u7269\u54c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Holi-DETR\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65f6\u5c1a\u5355\u54c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, this presents three key system challenges - model architecture diversity, kernel primitive diversity, and hardware generation and architecture heterogeneity. This paper presents KernelEvolve-an agentic kernel coding framework-to tackle heterogeneity at-scale for DLRM. KernelEvolve is designed to take kernel specifications as input and automate the process of kernel generation and optimization for recommendation model across heterogeneous hardware architectures. KernelEvolve does so by operating at multiple programming abstractions, from Triton and CuTe DSL to low-level hardware agnostic languages, spanning the full hardware-software optimization stack. The kernel optimization process is described as graph-based search with selection policy, universal operator, fitness function, and termination rule, dynamically adapts to runtime execution context through retrieval-augmented prompt synthesis. We designed, implemented, and deployed KernelEvolve to optimize a wide variety of production recommendation models across generations of NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, as well as Meta's AI accelerators. We validate KernelEvolve on the publicly-available KernelBench suite, achieving 100% pass rate on all 250 problems across three difficulty levels, and 160 PyTorch ATen operators across three heterogeneous hardware platforms, demonstrating 100% correctness.

Due to the scarcity of real defect images, unsupervised approaches that rely solely on normal images have been extensively studied. Recently, diffusion-based generative models brought attention to training data synthesis as an alternative solution. In this work, we focus on a strategy to effectively leverage synthetic images to maximize the anomaly detection performance. Previous synthesis strategies are broadly categorized into two groups, presenting a clear trade-off. Rule-based synthesis, such as injecting noise or pasting patches, is cost-effective but often fails to produce realistic defect images. On the other hand, generative model-based synthesis can create high-quality defect images but requires substantial cost. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained text-guided image-to-image translation model and image retrieval model to efficiently generate synthetic defect images. Specifically, the image retrieval model assesses the similarity of the generated images to real normal images and filters out irrelevant outputs, thereby enhancing the quality and relevance of the generated defect images. To effectively leverage synthetic images, we also introduce a two stage training strategy. In this strategy, the model is first pre-trained on a large volume of images from rule-based synthesis and then fine-tuned on a smaller set of high-quality images. This method significantly reduces the cost for data collection while improving the anomaly detection performance.

However, these models rely on large amounts of globally representative data, which often contain redundancy, noise, and class imbalance, reducing training efficiency and preventing convergence. Existing RS diffusion foundation models typically aggregate multiple classification datasets or apply simplistic deduplication, overlooking the distributional requirements of generation modeling and the heterogeneity of RS imagery. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free, two-stage data pruning approach that quickly select a high-quality subset under high pruning ratios, enabling a preliminary foundation model to converge rapidly and serve as a versatile backbone for generation, downstream fine-tuning, and other applications. Our method jointly considers local information content with global scene-level diversity and representativeness. First, an entropy-based criterion efficiently removes low-information samples. Next, leveraging RS scene classification datasets as reference benchmarks, we perform scene-aware clustering with stratified sampling to improve clustering effectiveness while reducing computational costs on large-scale unlabeled data. Finally, by balancing cluster-level uniformity and sample representativeness, the method enables fine-grained selection under high pruning ratios while preserving overall diversity and representativeness.

To address the deficiencies of existing methods, including the failure of fixed resolutions to balance efficiency and detail, as well as the lack of semantic hierarchy in single-scale alignment, this study proposes a Vision-language Model (VLM) framework integrated with two key innovations: the Dynamic Resolution Input Strategy (DRIS) and the Multi-scale Vision-language Alignment Mechanism (MS-VLAM).Specifically, the DRIS adopts a coarse-to-fine approach to adaptively allocate computational resources according to the complexity of image content, thereby preserving key fine-grained features while reducing redundant computational overhead. The MS-VLAM constructs a three-tier alignment mechanism covering object, local-region and global levels, which systematically captures cross-modal semantic consistency and alleviates issues of semantic misalignment and granularity imbalance.Experimental results on the RS-GPT4V dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the accuracy of semantic understanding and computational efficiency in tasks including image captioning and cross-modal retrieval. Compared with conventional methods, it achieves superior performance in evaluation metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr for image captioning, as well as R@10 for cross-modal retrieval.

However, the capabilities of any single LLM are inherently bounded. One solution originates from intricate interactions among multiple LLMs, rendering their collective performance surpasses that of any constituent model. Despite the rapid proliferation of multi-model integration techniques such as model routing and post-hoc ensembling, a unifying theoretical framework of performance scaling for multi-model collaboration remains absent. In this work, we propose the Law of Multi-model Collaboration, a scaling law that predicts the performance limits of LLM ensembles based on their aggregated parameter budget. To quantify the intrinsic upper bound of multi-model collaboration, we adopt a method-agnostic formulation and assume an idealized integration oracle where the total cross-entropy loss of each sample is determined by the minimum loss of any model in the model pool. Experimental results reveal that multi-model systems follow a power-law scaling with respect to the total parameter count, exhibiting a more significant improvement trend and a lower theoretical loss floor compared to single model scaling. Moreover, ensembles of heterogeneous model families achieve better performance scaling than those formed within a single model family, indicating that model diversity is a primary driver of collaboration gains. These findings suggest that model collaboration represents a critical axis for extending the intelligence frontier of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\"\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u5b9a\u5f8b\"\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u96c6\u5408\u5728\u603b\u53c2\u6570\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6781\u9650\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5047\u8bbe\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u8a00\u673a\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u9075\u5faa\u4e0e\u603b\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5e42\u5f8b\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8d8b\u52bf\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\u9650\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u65cf\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u6bd4\u540c\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\u65cf\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u662f\u534f\u4f5c\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5355\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5176\u81ea\u8eab\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u53ef\u7a81\u7834\u8fd9\u4e00\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u8a00\u673a\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5373\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684\u603b\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u7531\u6a21\u578b\u6c60\u4e2d\u4efb\u610f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u635f\u5931\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u603b\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u4e0a\u5448\u73b0\u5e42\u5f8b\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u7f29\u653e\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8d8b\u52bf\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\u9650\uff1b\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u540c\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u534f\u4f5c\u6536\u76ca\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u662f\u6269\u5c55\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u534f\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u5b9a\u5f8b\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

A key limitation of many model architectures is the implicit entanglement of morphological waveform patterns and rhythm dynamics, which can promote shortcut learning and amplify sensitivity to distribution shifts. We propose ECG-RAMBA, a framework that separates morphology and rhythm and then re-integrates them through context-aware fusion. ECG-RAMBA combines: (i) deterministic morphological features extracted by MiniRocket, (ii) global rhythm descriptors computed from heart-rate variability (HRV), and (iii) long-range contextual modeling via a bi-directional Mamba backbone. To improve sensitivity to transient abnormalities under windowed inference, we introduce a numerically stable Power Mean pooling operator ($Q=3$) that emphasizes high-evidence segments while avoiding the brittleness of max pooling and the dilution of averaging. We evaluate under a protocol-faithful setting with subject-level cross-validation, a fixed decision threshold, and no test-time adaptation. On the Chapman--Shaoxing dataset, ECG-RAMBA achieves a macro ROC-AUC $\\approx 0.85$. In zero-shot transfer, it attains PR-AUC $=0.708$ for atrial fibrillation detection on the external CPSC-2021 dataset, substantially outperforming a comparable raw-signal Mamba baseline, and shows consistent cross-dataset performance on PTB-XL. Ablation studies indicate that deterministic morphology provides a strong foundation, while explicit rhythm modeling and long-range context are critical drivers of cross-domain robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "ECG-RAMBA \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u79bb\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u5f62\u6001\u4e0e\u8282\u5f8b\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u878d\u5408\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 MiniRocket \u63d0\u53d6\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u3001HRV \u8ba1\u7b97\u5168\u5c40\u8282\u5f8b\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u5411 Mamba \u9aa8\u5e72\u8fdb\u884c\u957f\u7a0b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684 Power Mean \u6c60\u5316\uff08Q=3\uff09\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u77ac\u6001\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002\u5728\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e0b\u5bf9\u623f\u98a4\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fbe\u5230 PR-AUC 0.708\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728 PTB-XL \u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u91c7\u96c6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u5f62\u6001\u4e0e\u8282\u5f8b\u7279\u5f81\u9690\u5f0f\u8026\u5408\u5bfc\u81f4\u6377\u5f84\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u654f\u611f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u8026\u4e8c\u8005\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u57df\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "ECG-RAMBA \u5206\u79bb\u5f62\u6001\u4e0e\u8282\u594f\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528 MiniRocket \u63d0\u53d6\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5fc3\u7387\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff08HRV\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u8282\u5f8b\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5411 Mamba \u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u7a0b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u878d\u5408\u6574\u5408\u4e09\u8005\uff1b\u5f15\u5165 Power Mean \u6c60\u5316\uff08Q=3\uff09\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u9ad8\u8bc1\u636e\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u907f\u514d max pooling \u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u6c60\u5316\u7684\u7a00\u91ca\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728 Chapman--Shaoxing \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b8f\u5e73\u5747 ROC-AUC \u8fbe\u7ea6 0.85\uff1b\u5728 CPSC-2021 \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u623f\u98a4\uff0cPR-AUC \u8fbe 0.708\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684 Mamba \u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u5728 PTB-XL \u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u800c\u663e\u5f0f\u8282\u5f8b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u957f\u7a0b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u662f\u8de8\u57df\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "ECG-RAMBA \u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u5f62\u6001\u4e0e\u8282\u5f8b\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u667a\u80fd\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u957f\u671f\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, generating a sequence of images while preserving consistent character identity across diverse scene descriptions remains a challenging task. Existing methods often struggle with a trade-off between maintaining identity consistency and ensuring per-image prompt alignment. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, ASemconsist, that addresses this challenge through selective text embedding modification, enabling explicit semantic control over character identity without sacrificing prompt alignment. Furthermore, based on our analysis of padding embeddings in FLUX, we propose a semantic control strategy that repurposes padding embeddings as semantic containers. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive feature-sharing strategy that automatically evaluates textual ambiguity and applies constraints only to the ambiguous identity prompt. Finally, we propose a unified evaluation protocol, the Consistency Quality Score (CQS), which integrates identity preservation and per-image text alignment into a single comprehensive metric, explicitly capturing performance imbalances between the two metrics. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively overcoming prior trade-offs.

Recently, Gaussian Splatting has emerged as an efficient representation framework, and its extension to 2D image representation enables lightweight, yet expressive modeling of visual content. While recent 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) approaches provide compact storage and real-time decoding, they often produce blurry or indistinct boundaries when the number of Gaussians is small due to the lack of contour awareness. In this work, we propose a Contour Information-Aware 2D Gaussian Splatting framework that incorporates object segmentation priors into Gaussian-based image representation. By constraining each Gaussian to a specific segmentation region during rasterization, our method prevents cross-boundary blending and preserves edge structures under high compression.

While these CoT modes enhance reasoning capabilities, their generation of extended reasoning traces introduces substantial memory and latency overheads, posing challenges for practical deployment on Ascend NPUs. This paper addresses these computational constraints by leveraging low-bit quantization, which transforms FP16 computations into more efficient integer arithmetic. We introduce a unified low-bit inference framework, supporting INT8 (W8A8) and W4A8 quantization, specifically optimized for openPangu-Embedded models on the Atlas A2. Our comprehensive evaluation, conducted across all three CoT modes on code generation benchmarks (HumanEval and MBPP), demonstrates the efficacy of this approach. INT8 quantization consistently preserves over 90\\% of the FP16 baseline accuracy and achieves a 1.5x prefill speedup on the Atlas A2. Furthermore, W4A8 quantization significantly reduces memory consumption, albeit with a moderate trade-off in accuracy.

Caching-based methods achieve training-free acceleration, while suffering from considerable computational error. Existing methods typically incorporate error correction strategies such as pruning or prediction to mitigate it. However, their fixed caching strategy fails to adapt to the complex error variations during denoising, which limits the full potential of error correction. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel fidelity-optimization plugin for existing error correction methods via cumulative error minimization, named CEM. CEM predefines the error to characterize the sensitivity of model to acceleration jointly influenced by timesteps and cache intervals. Guided by this prior, we formulate a dynamic programming algorithm with cumulative error approximation for strategy optimization, which achieves the caching error minimization, resulting in a substantial improvement in generation fidelity. CEM is model-agnostic and exhibits strong generalization, which is adaptable to arbitrary acceleration budgets. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing error correction frameworks and quantized models without introducing any additional computational overhead.

To comprehensively represent gestures, video, and skeletal embeddings are extracted using MViTv2-S and 2s-AGCN, respectively. Then, they are integrated through a Cross-Modal Token Fusion module to combine spatial and pose information. For emotion recognition, our framework extends to behavior-based emotion prediction, a binary classification task identifying emotional states based on visual cues. We leverage facial and contextual embeddings extracted using SwinFace and MViTv2-S models and fuse them through an InterFusion module designed to capture emotional expressions and body gestures.

In this context, methods developed for the non-blind case cannot be adapted in a straightforward manner. Recently, data-driven approaches have been proposed to address blind inverse problems, demonstrating strong empirical performance and adaptability. However, these methods often lack interpretability and are not supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees, limiting their reliability in applied domains such as imaging inverse problems. In this work, we shed light on learning in blind inverse problems within the simplified yet insightful framework of Linear Minimum Mean Square Estimators (LMMSEs). We provide an in-depth theoretical analysis, deriving closed-form expressions for optimal estimators and extending classical results. In particular, we establish equivalences with suitably chosen Tikhonov-regularized formulations, where the regularization depends explicitly on the distributions of the unknown signal, the noise, and the random forward operators. We also prove convergence results under appropriate source condition assumptions. Furthermore, we derive rigorous finite-sample error bounds that characterize the performance of learned estimators as a function of the noise level, problem conditioning, and number of available samples.

This study presents a critical comparison between two fundamentally different AI architectures: the specialized open-source agent MedGemma and the proprietary large multimodal model GPT-4 for diagnosing six different diseases. The MedGemma-4b-it model, fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), demonstrated superior diagnostic capability by achieving a mean test accuracy of 80.37% compared to 69.58% for the untuned GPT-4. Furthermore, MedGemma exhibited notably higher sensitivity in high-stakes clinical tasks, such as cancer and pneumonia detection. Quantitative analysis via confusion matrices and classification reports provides comprehensive insights into model performance across all categories. These results emphasize that domain-specific fine-tuning is essential for minimizing hallucinations in clinical implementation, positioning MedGemma as a sophisticated tool for complex, evidence-based medical reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u4e24\u79cdAI\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578bMedGemma-4b-it\u4e0e\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578bGPT-4\u3002\u7ecfLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u7684MedGemma\u5728\u516d\u79cd\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe80.37%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u672a\u5fae\u8c03\u7684GPT-4\u768469.58%\u3002MedGemma\u5728\u764c\u75c7\u548c\u80ba\u708e\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u6dc6\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u62a5\u544a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5404\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u51cf\u5c11\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u51f8\u663eMedGemma\u5728\u590d\u6742\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u533b\u7597\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u8bca\u65ad\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e34\u5e8a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e34\u5e8a\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5173\u952e\u75be\u75c5\u68c0\u6d4b\u654f\u611f\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\uff08LoRA\uff09\u5fae\u8c03\u7684MedGemma-4b-it\u4e0e\u672a\u7ecf\u5fae\u8c03\u7684GPT-4\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u516d\u7c7b\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e73\u5747\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3001\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7b49\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u6dc6\u77e9\u9635\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u62a5\u544a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684MedGemma-4b-it\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u516d\u79cd\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523080.37%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u672a\u5fae\u8c03\u7684GPT-4\u768469.58%\u3002\u5728\u764c\u75c7\u548c\u80ba\u708e\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u75be\u75c5\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0cMedGemma\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u5404\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u5747\u5177\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e14\u6574\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u8f83\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7ecf\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578bMedGemma\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u8d85\u8d8a\u672a\u5fae\u8c03\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u6210\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u3001\u8bc1\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u578b\u533b\u7597\u63a8\u7406\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We propose frequency-guided graph structure learning (FgGSL), an end-to-end graph inference framework that jointly learns homophilic and heterophilic graph structures along with a spectral encoder. FgGSL employs a learnable, symmetric, feature-driven masking function to infer said complementary graphs, which are processed using pre-designed low- and high-pass graph filter banks. A label-based structural loss explicitly promotes the recovery of homophilic and heterophilic edges, enabling task-driven graph structure learning. We derive stability bounds for the structural loss and establish robustness guarantees for the filter banks under graph perturbations.

Existing methods that reconstruct 3D models from sketches often produce non-editable and approximate models that fall short of meeting the stringent requirements for precision and editability in industrial design. Moreover, the reliance on text or image-based inputs often requires significant manual annotation, limiting their scalability and applicability in industrial settings. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Heterogeneous Collaborative Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (CME-CAD) paradigm, a novel training paradigm for CAD code generation. Our approach integrates the complementary strengths of these models, facilitating collaborative learning and improving the model's ability to generate accurate, constraint-compatible, and fully editable CAD models. We introduce a two-stage training process: Multi-Expert Fine-Tuning (MEFT), and Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (MERL).

We begin from a single hypothesis: that visual understanding presupposes a semantic language for vision, in which many perceptual observations correspond to a small number of discrete semantic states. Together with widely assumed premises on transferability and abstraction in representation learning, this hypothesis implies that the visual observation space must be organized in a fiber bundle like structure, where nuisance variation populates fibers and semantics correspond to a quotient base space. From this structure we derive two theoretical consequences. First, the semantic quotient $X/G$ is not a submanifold of $X$ and cannot be obtained through smooth deformation alone, semantic invariance requires a non-homeomorphic, discriminative target, for example, supervision via labels, cross instance identification, or multimodal alignment that supplies explicit semantic equivalence. Second, we show that approximating the quotient also places structural demands on the model architecture. Semantic abstraction requires not only an external semantic target, but a representation mechanism capable of supporting topology change: an expand-and-snap process in which the manifold is first geometrically expanded to separate structure and then collapsed to form discrete semantic regions. We emphasize that these results are interpretive rather than prescriptive: the framework provides a topological lens that aligns with empirical regularities observed in large-scale discriminative and multimodal models, and with classical principles in statistical learning theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u89c6\u89d2\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u4e49\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5373\u591a\u4e2a\u611f\u77e5\u89c2\u5bdf\u5bf9\u5e94\u5c11\u91cf\u79bb\u6563\u8bed\u4e49\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e94\u5177\u6709\u7ea4\u7ef4\u4e1b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5e72\u6270\u53d8\u5316\u4f4d\u4e8e\u7ea4\u7ef4\u4e0a\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8e\u5546\u57fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u7531\u6b64\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u8bed\u4e49\u5546\u7a7a\u95f4 $X/G$ \u4e0d\u662f $X$ \u7684\u5b50\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u6ed1\u53d8\u5f62\u83b7\u5f97\uff0c\u9700\u975e\u540c\u80da\u7684\u5224\u522b\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u6807\u7b7e\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u8de8\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8bc6\u522b\u6216\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5546\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u9700\u5177\u5907\u62d3\u6251\u53d8\u6362\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5373\u901a\u8fc7\u201c\u6269\u5c55-\u6298\u53e0\u201d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u79bb\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u5f62\u6210\u79bb\u6563\u8bed\u4e49\u533a\u57df\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5224\u522b\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u62d3\u6251\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u76f8\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u6240\u9700\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u8bed\u8a00\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0e\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3001\u62bd\u8c61\u6027\u524d\u63d0\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7ea4\u7ef4\u4e1b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u5bfc\u8bed\u4e49\u5546\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u5149\u6ed1\u5316\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u53d8\u6362\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\uff081\uff09\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u5fc5\u987b\u4f9d\u8d56\u975e\u540c\u80da\u7684\u5224\u522b\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u8de8\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u5177\u5907\u652f\u6301\u62d3\u6251\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u201c\u6269\u5c55-\u6298\u53e0\u201d\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u62d3\u6251\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5224\u522b\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u65e2\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4e5f\u9700\u5177\u5907\u62d3\u6251\u53d8\u6362\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

However, recent state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches like Masked Autoencoding (MAE), despite their strong representation learning capabilities, lack temporal awareness. In this paper, we propose STAMP (Stochastic Temporal Autoencoder with Masked Pretraining), a Siamese MAE framework that encodes temporal information through a stochastic process by conditioning on the time difference between the 2 input volumes. Unlike deterministic Siamese approaches, which compare scans from different time points but fail to account for the inherent uncertainty in disease evolution, STAMP learns temporal dynamics stochastically by reframing the MAE reconstruction loss as a conditional variational inference objective. We evaluated STAMP on two OCT and one MRI datasets with multiple visits per patient.

However, existing approaches often rely on pre-constructed 3D representations or off-the-shelf reconstruction pipelines, which constrain scalability and real-world applicability. A recent line of work explores learning spatial reasoning directly from multi-view images, enabling Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand 3D scenes without explicit 3D reconstructions. Nevertheless, key challenges that frequently arise in real-world environments, such as partial visibility, occlusion, and low-overlap conditions that require spatial reasoning from fragmented visual cues, remain under-explored. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable multi-view data generation and annotation pipeline that constructs realistic spatial reasoning QAs, resulting in SpatialMosaic, a comprehensive instruction-tuning dataset featuring 2M QA pairs. We further introduce SpatialMosaic-Bench, a challenging benchmark for evaluating multi-view spatial reasoning under realistic and challenging scenarios, consisting of 1M QA pairs across 6 tasks.

However, RM training data is commonly recognized as low-quality, containing inductive biases that can easily lead to overfitting and reward hacking. For example, more detailed and comprehensive responses are usually human-preferred but with more words, leading response length to become one of the inevitable inductive biases. A limited number of prior RM debiasing approaches either target a single specific type of bias or model the problem with only simple linear correlations, \\textit{e.g.}, Pearson coefficients. To mitigate more complex and diverse inductive biases in reward modeling, we introduce a novel information-theoretic debiasing method called \\textbf{D}ebiasing via \\textbf{I}nformation optimization for \\textbf{R}M (DIR). Inspired by the information bottleneck (IB), we maximize the mutual information (MI) between RM scores and human preference pairs, while minimizing the MI between RM outputs and biased attributes of preference inputs. With theoretical justification from information theory, DIR can handle more sophisticated types of biases with non-linear correlations, broadly extending the real-world application scenarios for RM debiasing methods. In experiments, we verify the effectiveness of DIR with three types of inductive biases: \\textit{response length}, \\textit{sycophancy}, and \\textit{format}. We discover that DIR not only effectively mitigates target inductive biases but also enhances RLHF performance across diverse benchmarks, yielding better generalization abilities.

Current IMDL research typically uses cross-dataset evaluation, where models trained on one benchmark are tested on others. However, this simplified evaluation approach conceals the fragility of existing methods when handling diverse AI-generated content, leading to misleading impressions of progress. This paper challenges this illusion by proposing NeXT-IMDL, a large-scale diagnostic benchmark designed not just to collect data, but to probe the generalization boundaries of current detectors systematically. Specifically, NeXT-IMDL categorizes AIGC-based manipulations along four fundamental axes: editing models, manipulation types, content semantics, and forgery granularity. Built upon this, NeXT-IMDL implements five rigorous cross-dimension evaluation protocols. Our extensive experiments on 11 representative models reveal a critical insight: while these models perform well in their original settings, they exhibit systemic failures and significant performance degradation when evaluated under our designed protocols that simulate real-world, various generalization scenarios.

Native 3D methods relying on geometric cues often suffer from boundary leakage, center drift, and inconsistent tooth identities, especially for minority classes and complex anatomies. Meanwhile, 2D foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provide strong boundary-aware semantics, but directly applying them in 3D is impractical in clinical workflows. To address these issues, we propose SOFTooth, a semantics-enhanced, order-aware 2D-3D fusion framework that leverages frozen 2D semantics without explicit 2D mask supervision. First, a point-wise residual gating module injects occlusal-view SAM embeddings into 3D point features to refine tooth-gingiva and inter-tooth boundaries. Second, a center-guided mask refinement regularizes consistency between instance masks and geometric centroids, reducing center drift. Furthermore, an order-aware Hungarian matching strategy integrates anatomical tooth order and center distance into similarity-based assignment, ensuring coherent labeling even under missing or crowded dentitions.

However, its inherently complex nature, spanning visual perception, cognition, and emotion, poses fundamental challenges. Although aesthetic descriptions offer a viable representation of this complexity, two critical challenges persist: (1) data scarcity and imbalance: existing dataset overly focuses on visual perception and neglects deeper dimensions due to the expensive manual annotation; and (2) model fragmentation: current visual networks isolate aesthetic attributes with multi-branch encoder, while multimodal methods represented by contrastive learning struggle to effectively process long-form textual descriptions. To resolve challenge (1), we first present the Refined Aesthetic Description (RAD) dataset, a large-scale (70k), multi-dimensional structured dataset, generated via an iterative pipeline without heavy annotation costs and easy to scale. To address challenge (2), we propose ArtQuant, an aesthetics assessment framework for artistic images which not only couples isolated aesthetic dimensions through joint description generation, but also better models long-text semantics with the help of LLM decoders. Besides, theoretical analysis confirms this symbiosis: RAD's semantic adequacy (data) and generation paradigm (model) collectively minimize prediction entropy, providing mathematical grounding for the framework. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several datasets while requiring only 33% of conventional training epochs, narrowing the cognitive gap between artistic images and aesthetic judgment. We will release both code and dataset to support future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aArtQuant\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u827a\u672f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7f8e\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\uff0870k\uff09\u591a\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6RAD\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u788e\u7247\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0cArtQuant\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u63cf\u8ff0\u751f\u6210\u8026\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u7f8e\u5b66\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u957f\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u8bed\u4e49\u5145\u5206\u6027\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\u534f\u540c\u964d\u4f4e\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u5b66\u652f\u6301\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u9886\u5148\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u4f20\u7edf\u8bad\u7ec3\u5468\u671f\u768433%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u827a\u672f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u5ba1\u7f8e\u5224\u65ad\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5c06\u516c\u5f00\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f8e\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u6784\u5efa\u4eba\u673a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684AIGC\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4f53\u7cfb\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6d89\u53ca\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff08\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u6ce8\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u6df1\u5c42\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff09\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u788e\u7247\u5316\uff08\u591a\u5206\u652f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b64\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u7f8e\u5b66\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u957f\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff09\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faArtQuant\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6RAD\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u51cf\u5c11\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u63cf\u8ff0\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\u8026\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u7f8e\u5b66\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u957f\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\u2014\u2014\u4ec5\u9700\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd533%\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u5468\u671f\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u534f\u540c\u964d\u4f4e\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6RAD\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u7f8e\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6ArtQuant\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7f8e\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u4eba\u673a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684AIGC\u8bc4\u4ef7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u5f00\u653e\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

From ResNet for visual recognition to Transformer for vision-language alignment, the AI models have achieved superior capability to humans. Furthermore, the scaling law has enabled AI to initially develop general intelligence, as demonstrated by Large Language Models (LLMs). To this stage, AI has had an enormous influence on society and yet still keeps shaping the future for humanity. However, distribution shift remains a persistent ``Achilles' heel'', fundamentally limiting the reliability and general usefulness of ML systems. Moreover, generalization under distribution shift would also cause trust issues for AIs. Motivated by these challenges, my research focuses on \\textit{Trustworthy Machine Learning under Distribution Shifts}, with the goal of expanding AI's robustness, versatility, as well as its responsibility and reliability.

However, current approaches relegate world models to limited roles: they operate within ostensibly unified architectures that still keep world prediction and motion planning as decoupled processes. To bridge this gap, we propose DriveLaW, a novel paradigm that unifies video generation and motion planning. By directly injecting the latent representation from its video generator into the planner, DriveLaW ensures inherent consistency between high-fidelity future generation and reliable trajectory planning. Specifically, DriveLaW consists of two core components: DriveLaW-Video, our powerful world model that generates high-fidelity forecasting with expressive latent representations, and DriveLaW-Act, a diffusion planner that generates consistent and reliable trajectories from the latent of DriveLaW-Video, with both components optimized by a three-stage progressive training strategy. The power of our unified paradigm is demonstrated by new state-of-the-art results across both tasks. DriveLaW not only advances video prediction significantly, surpassing best-performing work by 33.3% in FID and 1.8% in FVD, but also achieves a new record on the NAVSIM planning benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "DriveLaW\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u76f4\u63a5\u6ce8\u5165\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u672a\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u65b0\u7eaa\u5f55\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u867d\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u4ec5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4e14\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u4ecd\u4e3a\u89e3\u8026\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5185\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "DriveLaW\u7531\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6784\u6210\uff1aDriveLaW-Video\uff08\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff09\u548cDriveLaW-Act\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff09\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cFID\u63d0\u534733.3%\uff0cFVD\u63d0\u53471.8%\uff1b\u5728NAV SIM\u89c4\u5212\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u521b\u4e0b\u65b0\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5353\u8d8a\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "DriveLaW\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Experimental results on the SEED-IV dataset demonstrate that EGDA achieves robust cross-session performance, obtaining accuracies of 81.22%, 80.15%, and 83.27% across three transfer tasks, and surpassing several baseline methods.

In this work, we introduce Direct Diffusion Score Preference Optimization (DDSPO), which directly derives per-timestep supervision from winning and losing policies when such policies are available. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on final samples, DDSPO provides dense, transition-level signals across the denoising trajectory. In practice, we avoid reliance on labeled data by automatically generating preference signals using a pretrained reference model: we contrast its outputs when conditioned on original prompts versus semantically degraded variants. This practical strategy enables effective score-space preference supervision without explicit reward modeling or manual annotations. Empirical results demonstrate that DDSPO improves text-image alignment and visual quality, outperforming or matching existing preference-based methods while requiring significantly less supervision.

This work investigates whether uncertainty quantification can mitigate such challenges and enhance model generalisability in a domain-agnostic manner. To this end, we (1) curate UncertSAM, a benchmark comprising eight datasets designed to stress-test SAM under challenging segmentation conditions including shadows, transparency, and camouflage; (2) evaluate a suite of lightweight, post-hoc uncertainty estimation methods; and (3) assess a preliminary uncertainty-guided prediction refinement step. Among evaluated approaches, a last-layer Laplace approximation yields uncertainty estimates that correlate well with segmentation errors, indicating a meaningful signal. While refinement benefits are preliminary, our findings underscore the potential of incorporating uncertainty into segmentation models to support robust, domain-agnostic performance.

Our framework provides a more robust and statistically rigorous approach to quality control while maintaining the interpretability and ease of use of classic methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u7f6e\u4fe1\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\uff08SPC\uff09\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u590d\u6742\u5236\u9020\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u5e94\u7528\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u56fe\uff0c\u53ef\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5982'\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7a81\u589e'\u7b49\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76d1\u63a7\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u91cd\u65b0\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u76f4\u89c2\u7684p\u503c\u56fe\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6613\u7528\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\uff08SPC\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5e38\u88ab\u8fdd\u53cd\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u590d\u6742\u5236\u9020\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u6613\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u7f6e\u4fe1\u9884\u6d4b\uff08Conformal Prediction\uff09\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5176\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u5e94\u7528\uff1a(1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u56fe\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u9884\u8b66\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b(2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76d1\u63a7\uff0c\u5c06\u76d1\u63a7\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u76f4\u89c2\u7684p\u503c\u56fe\u5448\u73b0\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u826f\u597d\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u53cb\u597d\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5f02\u5e38\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7a81\u589e\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfSPC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u517c\u5177\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u667a\u80fd\u5236\u9020\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76d1\u63a7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We tested a large number of different image-based deep learning algorithms for road classification. In addition, we used road acceleration data along with road image data for training by using them as images. We compared the performances of acceleration-based and camera image-based approaches. The performances of the simple Alexnet, LeNet, VGG, and Resnet algorithms were compared as deep learning algorithms. For road condition classification, 5 classes were considered: asphalt, damaged asphalt, gravel road, damaged gravel road, pavement road and over 95% accuracy performance was achieved.

The dominant paradigm--Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)--enforces feature invariance, aligning source and target representations via symmetric divergence minimization [Ganin et al., 2016]. We demonstrate that this approach is fundamentally flawed: when domains are unequally informative (e.g., high-quality vs degraded sensors), strict invariance necessitates information destruction, causing \"negative transfer\" that can be catastrophic in safety-critical applications [Wang et al., 2019].\n  We propose a decision-theoretic framework grounded in Le Cam's theory of statistical experiments [Le Cam, 1986], using constructive approximations to replace symmetric invariance with directional simulability. We introduce Le Cam Distortion, quantified by the Deficiency Distance $\u03b4(E_1, E_2)$, as a rigorous upper bound for transfer risk conditional on simulability. Our framework enables transfer without source degradation by learning a kernel that simulates the target from the source. Across five experiments (genomics, vision, reinforcement learning), Le Cam Distortion achieves: (1) near-perfect frequency estimation in HLA genomics (correlation $r=0.999$, matching classical methods), (2) zero source utility loss in CIFAR-10 image classification (81.2% accuracy preserved vs 34.7% drop for CycleGAN), and (3) safe policy transfer in RL control where invariance-based methods suffer catastrophic collapse. Le Cam Distortion provides the first principled framework for risk-controlled transfer learning in domains where negative transfer is unacceptable: medical imaging, autonomous systems, and precision medicine.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u4f20\u7edf\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u56e0\u5f3a\u5236\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eLe Cam\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u53ef\u6a21\u62df\u6027\u66ff\u4ee3\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5f15\u5165Le Cam\u7578\u53d8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u98ce\u9669\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u635f\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5b66\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u591a\u9886\u57df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u9996\u4e2a\u98ce\u9669\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u9002\u5e94\uff08UDA\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u79f0\u6563\u5ea6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5f3a\u5236\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9886\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u65f6\uff08\u5982\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u52a3\u8d28\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e25\u683c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7834\u574f\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u2018\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u2019\uff0c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u9020\u6210\u707e\u96be\u6027\u540e\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eLe Cam\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u53ef\u6a21\u62df\u6027\u66ff\u4ee3\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff1b\u5f15\u5165Le Cam\u7578\u53d8\uff08Deficiency Distance $\u03b4(E_1, E_2)$\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f6c\u79fb\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u4e2a\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u6e90\u57df\u6a21\u62df\u76ee\u6807\u57df\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6e90\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5b66\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u4eba\u7c7b\u767d\u7ec6\u80de\u6297\u539f\uff08HLA\uff09\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u9891\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u8fbe0.999\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\uff082\uff09CIFAR-10\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u6e90\u57df\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4fdd\u630181.2%\uff0c\u800cCycleGAN\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0b\u964d\u81f334.7%\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u51fa\u73b0\u707e\u96be\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "conclusion": "Le Cam Distortion \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5728\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u3001\u7cbe\u51c6\u533b\u7597\uff09\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u98ce\u9669\u53ef\u63a7\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u539f\u7406\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, they still tend to produce hallucinated content that is inconsistent with the visual input, which limits their reliability in real-world applications. We propose \\textbf{CoFi-Dec}, a training-free decoding framework that mitigates hallucinations by integrating generative self-feedback with coarse-to-fine visual conditioning. Inspired by the human visual process from global scene perception to detailed inspection, CoFi-Dec first generates two intermediate textual responses conditioned on coarse- and fine-grained views of the original image. These responses are then transformed into synthetic images using a text-to-image model, forming multi-level visual hypotheses that enrich grounding cues. To unify the predictions from these multiple visual conditions, we introduce a Wasserstein-based fusion mechanism that aligns their predictive distributions into a geometrically consistent decoding trajectory. This principled fusion reconciles high-level semantic consistency with fine-grained visual grounding, leading to more robust and faithful outputs. Extensive experiments on six hallucination-focused benchmarks show that CoFi-Dec substantially reduces both entity-level and semantic-level hallucinations, outperforming existing decoding strategies. The framework is model-agnostic, requires no additional training, and can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of LVLMs. The implementation is available at https://github.com/AI-Researcher-Team/CoFi-Dec.", "AI": {"tldr": "CoFi-Dec \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u81ea\u53cd\u9988\u4e0e\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u5230\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ece\u5168\u5c40\u573a\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u5230\u7ec6\u8282\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5148\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7c97\u7565\u548c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u89c6\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e2d\u95f4\u6587\u672c\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u751f\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u591a\u5c42\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u5047\u8bbe\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002\u6700\u540e\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eWasserstein\u7684\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u7cbe\u51c6\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCoFi-Dec\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u805a\u7126\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ea7\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea7\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u7279\u5b9a\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u53ef\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u914d\u5404\u7c7bLVLMs\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCoFi-Dec\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u89c6\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u4e2d\u95f4\u6587\u672c\u54cd\u5e94\uff1b2\uff09\u5229\u7528\u6587\u751f\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u5c42\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u5047\u8bbe\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eWasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cCoFi-Dec\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ea7\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea7\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u591a\u79cdLVLMs\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CoFi-Dec\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u81ea\u53cd\u9988\u4e0e\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u4f4e\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u7528\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Traditional hydrological observation methods are often limited by manual measurement errors and environmental constraints. This study presents a hybrid framework integrating vision based waterline detection, YOLOv8 pose scale extraction, and large multimodal language models (GPT 4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash) for automated river gauge plate reading. The methodology involves sequential stages of image preprocessing, annotation, waterline detection, scale gap estimation, and numeric reading extraction. Experiments demonstrate that waterline detection achieved high precision of 94.24 percent and an F1 score of 83.64 percent, while scale gap detection provided accurate geometric calibration for subsequent reading extraction. Incorporating scale gap metadata substantially improved the predictive performance of LLMs, with Gemini Stage 2 achieving the highest accuracy, with a mean absolute error of 5.43 cm, root mean square error of 8.58 cm, and R squared of 0.84 under optimal image conditions. Results highlight the sensitivity of LLMs to image quality, with degraded images producing higher errors, and underscore the importance of combining geometric metadata with multimodal artificial intelligence for robust water level estimation. Overall, the proposed approach offers a scalable, efficient, and reliable solution for automated hydrological monitoring, demonstrating potential for real time river gauge digitization and improved water resource management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u6c34\u4f4d\u7ebf\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001YOLOv8\u59ff\u6001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08GPT-4o\u4e0eGemini 2.0 Flash\uff09\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6cb3\u6d41\u6c34\u4f4d\u8ba1\u8bfb\u6570\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u6c34\u4f4d\u7ebf\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u523b\u5ea6\u95f4\u8ddd\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u8bfb\u53d6\u63d0\u53d6\u7b49\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6c34\u4f4d\u7ebf\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe94.24%\uff0cF1\u5f97\u5206\u4e3a83.64%\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u523b\u5ea6\u95f4\u8ddd\u5143\u6570\u636e\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dGemini Stage 2\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u56fe\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a5.43\u5398\u7c73\uff0c\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a8.58\u5398\u7c73\uff0c\u51b3\u5b9a\u7cfb\u6570R\u00b2\u4e3a0.84\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eLLM\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u52a3\u8d28\u56fe\u50cf\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5dee\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u51e0\u4f55\u5143\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001AI\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u53ef\u9760\u6c34\u4f4d\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u6cb3\u6d41\u6c34\u4f4d\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u4e0e\u6c34\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6c34\u6587\u89c2\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u73af\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u51c6\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u6cb3\u6d41\u6c34\u4f4d\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u6d2a\u6c34\u9884\u8b66\u3001\u6c34\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u751f\u6001\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u6c34\u4f4d\u7ebf\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u523b\u5ea6\u95f4\u8ddd\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5229\u7528YOLOv8\u59ff\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08GPT-4o\u548cGemini 2.0 Flash\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u5b57\u8bfb\u53d6\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u5143\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6c34\u4f4d\u7ebf\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe94.24%\uff0cF1\u5f97\u5206\u4e3a83.64%\uff1b\u523b\u5ea6\u95f4\u8ddd\u4f30\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u6821\u51c6\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u523b\u5ea6\u95f4\u8ddd\u5143\u6570\u636e\u540e\uff0cGemini Stage 2\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee5.43\u5398\u7c73\u3001\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee8.58\u5398\u7c73\u3001R\u00b2=0.84\uff1b\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u65f6\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6c34\u4f4d\u8bfb\u6570\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u6cb3\u6d41\u6c34\u4f4d\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u548c\u6c34\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u878d\u5408\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u667a\u80fd\u6c34\u6587\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Under this formulation, we only use a standard architecture -- a Transformer with sliding-window attention. However, our model continues learning at test time via next-token prediction on the given context, compressing the context it reads into its weights. In addition, we improve the model's initialization for learning at test time via meta-learning at training time. Overall, our method, a form of Test-Time Training (TTT), is End-to-End (E2E) both at test time (via next-token prediction) and training time (via meta-learning), in contrast to previous forms. We conduct extensive experiments with a focus on scaling properties. In particular, for 3B models trained with 164B tokens, our method (TTT-E2E) scales with context length in the same way as Transformer with full attention, while others, such as Mamba 2 and Gated DeltaNet, do not. However, similar to RNNs, TTT-E2E has constant inference latency regardless of context length, making it 2.7 times faster than full attention for 128K context.

Uniquely, we introduce a comprehensive, full-stage training paradigm -- including large-scale pretraining on over 3,000 hours of motion data, high-quality fine-tuning on 400 hours of curated data, and reinforcement learning from both human feedback and reward models -- to ensure precise alignment with the text instruction and high motion quality. This framework is supported by our meticulous data processing pipeline, which performs rigorous motion cleaning and captioning.

Nonetheless, when confronted with lengthy videos, these models struggle: their temporal windows are narrow, and they fail to notice fine-grained semantic shifts that unfold over extended durations. Moreover, mainstream text-based retrieval pipelines, which rely chiefly on surface-level lexical overlap, ignore the rich temporal interdependence among visual, audio, and subtitle channels. To mitigate these limitations, we propose TV-RAG, a training-free architecture that couples temporal alignment with entropy-guided semantics to improve long-video reasoning. The framework contributes two main mechanisms: \\emph{(i)} a time-decay retrieval module that injects explicit temporal offsets into the similarity computation, thereby ranking text queries according to their true multimedia context; and \\emph{(ii)} an entropy-weighted key-frame sampler that selects evenly spaced, information-dense frames, reducing redundancy while preserving representativeness. By weaving these temporal and semantic signals together, TV-RAG realises a dual-level reasoning routine that can be grafted onto any LVLM without re-training or fine-tuning. The resulting system offers a lightweight, budget-friendly upgrade path and consistently surpasses most leading baselines across established long-video benchmarks such as Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench, confirming the effectiveness of our model.

A limitation in current approaches is their focus on basic geometric relationships or localized features, often neglecting cross-scale contextual interactions between objects. This paper introduces the Deep Panoptic Context Aggregation Network (PanCAN), a novel approach that hierarchically integrates multi-order geometric contexts through cross-scale feature aggregation in a high-dimensional Hilbert space. Specifically, PanCAN learns multi-order neighborhood relationships at each scale by combining random walks with an attention mechanism. Modules from different scales are cascaded, where salient anchors at a finer scale are selected and their neighborhood features are dynamically fused via attention. This enables effective cross-scale modeling that significantly enhances complex scene understanding by combining multi-order and cross-scale context-aware features. Extensive multi-label classification experiments on NUS-WIDE, PASCAL VOC2007, and MS-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that PanCAN consistently achieves competitive results, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, thereby substantially improving multi-label classification performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDeep Panoptic Context Aggregation Network (PanCAN)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u6574\u5408\u591a\u9636\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u4e0e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5b66\u4e60\u5404\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u591a\u9636\u90bb\u57df\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u951a\u70b9\u7684\u90bb\u57df\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5728NUS-WIDE\u3001PASCAL VOC2007\u548cMS-COCO\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u57fa\u672c\u51e0\u4f55\u5173\u7cfb\u6216\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u7269\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "PanCAN\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u4e0e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u9636\u90bb\u57df\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6a21\u5757\u7ea7\u8054\uff0c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u951a\u70b9\u88ab\u9009\u4e2d\u540e\uff0c\u5176\u90bb\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728NUS-WIDE\u3001PASCAL VOC2007\u548cMS-COCO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cPanCAN\u5728\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9a\u91cf\u4e0e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "PanCAN\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u591a\u9636\u4e0e\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Although inference-time scaling can theoretically improve this trade-off by allocating more computation, existing strategies remain suboptimal: reward-driven particle optimization often causes perceptual over-smoothing, while optimal-path search tends to lose structural consistency. To overcome these difficulties, we propose Iterative Diffusion Inference-Time Scaling with Adaptive Frequency Steering (IAFS), a training-free framework that jointly leverages iterative refinement and frequency-aware particle fusion. IAFS addresses the challenge of balancing perceptual quality and structural fidelity by progressively refining the generated image through iterative correction of structural deviations. Simultaneously, it ensures effective frequency fusion by adaptively integrating high-frequency perceptual cues with low-frequency structural information, allowing for a more accurate and balanced reconstruction across different image details. Extensive experiments across multiple diffusion-based SR models show that IAFS effectively resolves the perception-fidelity conflict, yielding consistently improved perceptual detail and structural accuracy, and outperforming existing inference-time scaling methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u6269\u6563\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5IAFS\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec6\u5316\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9891\u7387\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e2d\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9ad8\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4f4e\u9891\u7387\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u5b58\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u6216\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faIAFS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fed\u4ee3\u4fee\u6b63\u7ed3\u6784\u504f\u5dee\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u9ad8\u9891\u611f\u77e5\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u4f4e\u9891\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u9010\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cIAFS\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u611f\u77e5\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "IAFS\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u4e0e\u9891\u7387\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u611f\u77e5-\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address issues such as subjects missing or conflicts, recent works incorporate layout guidance to provide explicit spatial constraints. However, existing methods still struggle to balance three critical objectives: text alignment, subject identity preservation, and layout control, while the reliance on additional training further limits their scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we present AnyMS, a novel training-free framework for layout-guided multi-subject customization. AnyMS leverages three input conditions: text prompt, subject images, and layout constraints, and introduces a bottom-up dual-level attention decoupling mechanism to harmonize their integration during generation. Specifically, global decoupling separates cross-attention between textual and visual conditions to ensure text alignment. Local decoupling confines each subject's attention to its designated area, which prevents subject conflicts and thus guarantees identity preservation and layout control. Moreover, AnyMS employs pre-trained image adapters to extract subject-specific features aligned with the diffusion model, removing the need for subject learning or adapter tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnyMS achieves state-of-the-art performance, supporting complex compositions and scaling to a larger number of subjects.", "AI": {"tldr": "AnyMS \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u5f15\u5bfc\u591a\u4e3b\u4f53\u5b9a\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u4e3b\u4f53\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u5e03\u5c40\u7ea6\u675f\u4e09\u79cd\u8f93\u5165\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u5e95\u5411\u4e0a\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u89e3\u8026\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u4e3b\u4f53\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u5e03\u5c40\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u5176\u91c7\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u50cf\u9002\u914d\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4e3b\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4e3b\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u6216\u9002\u914d\u5668\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e3b\u4f53\u5b9a\u5236\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u4e3b\u4f53\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u5e03\u5c40\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3-free\u6846\u67b6AnyMS\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u91cd\u8f93\u5165\uff08\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u4e3b\u4f53\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u5e03\u5c40\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5168\u5c40\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u53cc\u91cd\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u89e3\u8026\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u8026\u5206\u79bb\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u5c40\u90e8\u89e3\u8026\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e3b\u4f53\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9650\u5236\u5728\u5176\u6307\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u4fdd\u969c\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u5e03\u5c40\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u50cf\u9002\u914d\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u4e3b\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u66f4\u591a\u4e3b\u4f53\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "AnyMS \u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u4e3b\u4f53\u5b9a\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Traditional safety methods like text blacklisting or harmful content classification have significant drawbacks: they can be easily circumvented or require extensive datasets and extra training. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PurifyGen, a novel, training-free approach for safe T2I generation that retains the model's original weights. PurifyGen introduces a dual-stage strategy for prompt purification. First, we evaluate the safety of each token in a prompt by computing its complementary semantic distance, which measures the semantic proximity between the prompt tokens and concept embeddings from predefined toxic and clean lists. This enables fine-grained prompt classification without explicit keyword matching or retraining. Tokens closer to toxic concepts are flagged as risky. Second, for risky prompts, we apply a dual-space transformation: we project toxic-aligned embeddings into the null space of the toxic concept matrix, effectively removing harmful semantic components, and simultaneously align them into the range space of clean concepts. This dual alignment purifies risky prompts by both subtracting unsafe semantics and reinforcing safe ones, while retaining the original intent and coherence. We further define a token-wise strategy to selectively replace only risky token embeddings, ensuring minimal disruption to safe content. PurifyGen offers a plug-and-play solution with theoretical grounding and strong generalization to unseen prompts and models. Extensive testing shows that PurifyGen surpasses current methods in reducing unsafe content across five datasets and competes well with training-dependent approaches.

Here, we introduce RxnBench, a multi-tiered benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate MLLMs on chemical reaction understanding from scientific PDFs. RxnBench comprises two tasks: Single-Figure QA (SF-QA), which tests fine-grained visual perception and mechanistic reasoning using 1,525 questions derived from 305 curated reaction schemes, and Full-Document QA (FD-QA), which challenges models to synthesize information from 108 articles, requiring cross-modal integration of text, schemes, and tables. Our evaluation of MLLMs reveals a critical capability gap: while models excel at extracting explicit text, they struggle with deep chemical logic and precise structural recognition. Notably, models with inference-time reasoning significantly outperform standard architectures, yet none achieve 50\\% accuracy on FD-QA.

However, its extension to generation tasks remains nascent and limited by scenario-specific mechanisms that hinder generalization and adaptation. In this work, we present ThinkGen, the first think-driven visual generation framework that explicitly leverages MLLM's CoT reasoning in various generation scenarios. ThinkGen employs a decoupled architecture comprising a pretrained MLLM and a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), wherein the MLLM generates tailored instructions based on user intent, and DiT produces high-quality images guided by these instructions. We further propose a separable GRPO-based training paradigm (SepGRPO), alternating reinforcement learning between the MLLM and DiT modules.

To address these challenges, we propose ProGuard, a vision-language proactive guard that identifies and describes out-of-distribution (OOD) safety risks without the need for model adjustments required by traditional reactive approaches. We first construct a modality-balanced dataset of 87K samples, each annotated with both binary safety labels and risk categories under a hierarchical multimodal safety taxonomy, effectively mitigating modality bias and ensuring consistent moderation across text, image, and text-image inputs. Based on this dataset, we train our vision-language base model purely through reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve efficient and concise reasoning. To approximate proactive safety scenarios in a controlled setting, we further introduce an OOD safety category inference task and augment the RL objective with a synonym-bank-based similarity reward that encourages the model to generate concise descriptions for unseen unsafe categories. Experimental results show that ProGuard achieves performance comparable to closed-source large models on binary safety classification, substantially outperforms existing open-source guard models on unsafe content categorization. Most notably, ProGuard delivers a strong proactive moderation ability, improving OOD risk detection by 52.6% and OOD risk description by 64.8%.", "AI": {"tldr": "ProGuard\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u4e3b\u52a8\u9632\u62a4\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa87K\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u5916\uff08OOD\uff09\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u98ce\u9669\u7c7b\u522b\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u4e8c\u5143\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u5ab2\u7f8e\u95ed\u6e90\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u6e90\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9886\u5148\uff0c\u5e76\u5728OOD\u98ce\u9669\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534752.6%\u548c64.8%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u5916\uff08OOD\uff09\u98ce\u9669\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e3b\u52a8\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u6574\u3001\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u63cf\u8ff0\u672a\u77e5\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u9632\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b87K\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6807\u6ce8\u4e8c\u5143\u5b89\u5168\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0e\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u7c7b\u522b\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u540c\u4e49\u8bcd\u5e93\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u7b80\u6d01\u63cf\u8ff0\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3b\u52a8\u5f0f\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u3002", "result": "ProGuard\u5728\u4e8c\u5143\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u95ed\u6e90\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u6e90\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u98ce\u9669\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u63cf\u8ff0\u65b9\u9762\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534752.6%\u548c64.8%\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u9632\u62a4\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ProGuard\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, the simultaneous denoising of all video frames with bidirectional attention via an iterative process in diffusion models prevents real-time interaction. While existing distillation methods can make the model autoregressive and reduce sampling steps to mitigate this, they focus primarily on text-to-video generation, leaving the human-AI interaction unnatural and less efficient. This paper targets real-time interactive video diffusion conditioned on a multimodal context, including text, image, and audio, to bridge the gap. Given the observation that the leading on-policy distillation approach Self Forcing encounters challenges (visual artifacts like flickering, black frames, and quality degradation) with multimodal conditioning, we investigate an improved distillation recipe with emphasis on the quality of condition inputs as well as the initialization and schedule for the on-policy optimization. On benchmarks for multimodal-conditioned (audio, image, and text) avatar video generation including HDTF, AVSpeech, and CelebV-HQ, our distilled model matches the visual quality of the full-step, bidirectional baselines of similar or larger size with 20x less inference cost and latency. Further, we integrate our model with audio language models and long-form video inference technique Anchor-Heavy Identity Sinks to build LiveTalk, a real-time multimodal interactive avatar system. System-level evaluation on our curated multi-turn interaction benchmark shows LiveTalk outperforms state-of-the-art models (Sora2, Veo3) in multi-turn video coherence and content quality, while reducing response latency from 1 to 2 minutes to real-time generation, enabling seamless human-AI multimodal interaction.", "AI": {"tldr":

Enhancing Visual Perception in Vision-Language Models", "comment": "Project webpage: https://glab-caltech.github.io/twin/", "summary": "Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but remain coarse-grained, exhibit visual biases, and miss subtle visual details. Existing training corpora reinforce this limitation by emphasizing general recognition (\"Is it a cat or a dog?\") over fine-grained perception. To address this, we introduce a new training corpus and task designed to enhance the perceptual abilities of VLMs. TWIN is a large-scale dataset of 561,000 image-pair queries that task models to determine whether two visually similar images depict the same object, encouraging attention to nuanced visual cues. The dataset spans a diverse range of everyday objects across contexts, viewpoints, and appearances. Fine-tuning VLMs on TWIN yields notable gains in fine-grained recognition, even on unseen domains such as art, animals, plants, and landmarks. To quantify these gains, we introduce FGVQA, a benchmark suite of 12,000 queries that repurposes fine-grained recognition and retrieval datasets from multiple domains. While existing VLMs struggle on FGVQA, when fine-tuned on TWIN they improve by up to 19.3%, without compromising performance on general VQA benchmarks. Finally, our TWIN dataset scales favorably with object annotations, and our analysis shows that scale is key to performance. We envision TWIN as a drop-in addition to open-source VLM training corpora, advancing perceptual precision of future models.

Previous studies have reported strong performance with popular detection models. For example, YOLOv7 achieved an mAP50-95 of 0.51 using an input image size of 640 x 1280, RT-DETR reached an mAP50-95 of 0.65 with an image size of 640 x 640, and YOLOv9 obtained an mAP50-95 of 0.598 at the same resolution. Despite these results, limitations in dataset construction continue to cause issues, particularly the frequent misclassification of bright artificial lights as fire.\n  This report presents three main contributions: an additional NIR dataset, a two-stage detection model, and Patched-YOLO. First, to address data scarcity, we explore and apply various data augmentation strategies for both the NIR dataset and the classification dataset. Second, to improve night-time fire detection accuracy while reducing false positives caused by artificial lights, we propose a two-stage pipeline combining YOLOv11 and EfficientNetV2-B0. The proposed approach achieves higher detection accuracy compared to previous methods, particularly for night-time fire detection. Third, to improve fire detection in RGB images, especially for small and distant objects, we introduce Patched-YOLO, which enhances the model's detection capability through patch-based processing.

These complexities require to be addressed with an effective and scalable system that can assist in enhancing the salience of the subtle visual cues and provide a high level of the generalization on the multimodal imaging data. A Scalable Residual Feature Aggregation (SRFA) framework is proposed to be used to meet these conditions in this study. The framework integrates a pipeline of preprocessing followed by the segmentation using the MAGRes-UNet that is effective in making the pancreatic structures and isolating regions of interest more visible. DenseNet-121 performed with residual feature storage is used to extract features to allow deep hierarchical features to be aggregated without properties loss. To go further, hybrid HHO-BA metaheuristic feature selection strategy is used, which guarantees the best feature subset refinement. To be classified, the system is trained based on a new hybrid model that integrates the ability to pay attention on the world, which is the Vision Transformer (ViT) with the high representational efficiency of EfficientNet-B3. A dual optimization mechanism incorporating SSA and GWO is used to fine-tune hyperparameters to enhance greater robustness and less overfitting. Experimental results support the significant improvement in performance, with the suggested model reaching 96.23% accuracy, 95.58% F1-score and 94.83% specificity, the model is significantly better than the traditional CNNs and contemporary transformer-based models. Such results highlight the possibility of the SRFA framework as a useful instrument in the early detection of pancreatic tumors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\uff08SRFA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728CT\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u80f0\u817a\u80bf\u7624\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3001MAGRes-UNet\u5206\u5272\u3001DenseNet-121\u6b8b\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u6df7\u5408HHO-BA\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u3001ViT\u4e0eEfficientNet-B3\u878d\u5408\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8eSSA\u548cGWO\u7684\u53cc\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u5fae\u5f31\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0896.23%\uff09\u3001F1\u5206\u6570\uff0895.58%\uff09\u548c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff0894.83%\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfCNN\u548c\u73b0\u6709Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5728\u80f0\u817a\u80bf\u7624\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u80f0\u817a\u80bf\u7624\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u80bf\u7624\u5728CT\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u4f4e\u4e14\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u7ec6\u5fae\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u53ef\u8fa8\u8bc6\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSRFA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3001MAGRes-UNet\u5206\u5272\u3001DenseNet-121\u6b8b\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u6df7\u5408HHO-BA\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u878d\u5408ViT\u4e0eEfficientNet-B3\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8eSSA\u548cGWO\u7684\u53cc\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u7cbe\u8c03\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0896.23%\uff09\u3001F1-score\uff0895.58%\uff09\u548c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff0894.83%\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfCNN\u548c\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "SRFA\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u80f0\u817a\u80bf\u7624\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Understanding their memorization could help prevent training data leakage and improve the diversity of generated results. In this paper, we design an evaluation framework to quantify memorization in 3D generative models and study the influence of different data and modeling designs on memorization. We first apply our framework to quantify memorization in existing methods. Next, through controlled experiments with a latent vector-set (Vecset) diffusion model, we find that, on the data side, memorization depends on data modality, and increases with data diversity and finer-grained conditioning; on the modeling side, it peaks at a moderate guidance scale and can be mitigated by longer Vecsets and simple rotation augmentation. Together, our framework and analysis provide an empirical understanding of memorization in 3D generative models and suggest simple yet effective strategies to reduce it without degrading generation quality.

Existing methods typically rely on the attention mechanism to align objects across frames, simplifying the motion model with a unified explicit physical model (constant velocity, etc.). These approaches prefer semantic features for implicit alignment, challenging the importance of explicit motion modeling in the traditional perception paradigm. However, variations in motion states and object features across categories and frames render this alignment suboptimal. To address this, we propose HAT, a spatio-temporal alignment module that allows each object to adaptively decode the optimal alignment proposal from multiple hypotheses without direct supervision. Specifically, HAT first utilizes multiple explicit motion models to generate spatial anchors and motion-aware feature proposals for historical instances. It then performs multi-hypothesis decoding by incorporating semantic and motion cues embedded in cached object queries, ultimately providing the optimal alignment proposal for the target frame. On nuScenes, HAT consistently improves 3D temporal detectors and trackers across diverse baselines. It achieves state-of-the-art tracking results with 46.0% AMOTA on the test set when paired with the DETR3D detector. In an object-centric E2E AD method, HAT enhances perception accuracy (+1.3% mAP, +3.1% AMOTA) and reduces the collision rate by 32%. When semantics are corrupted (nuScenes-C), the enhancement of motion modeling by HAT enables more robust perception and planning in the E2E AD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHAT\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u89e3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65f6\u7a7a\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d3D\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u53d7\u635f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u5e27\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u663e\u5f0f\u8fd0\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff1b\u800c\u7269\u4f53\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u5e27\u95f4\u8fd0\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "HAT\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u663e\u5f0f\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7a7a\u95f4\u951a\u70b9\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u6848\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cHAT\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u79cd3D\u65f6\u95f4\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4e0e\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5668\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u642d\u914dDETR3D\u8fbe\u523046.0% AMOTA\uff1b\u5728\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u611f\u77e5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff08mAP+1.3%\uff0cAMOTA+3.1%\uff09\uff0c\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u964d\u4f4e32%\uff1b\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u53d7\u635f\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HAT\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u8fd0\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Recent diffusion-based methods have achieved strong results for single-view intrinsic decomposition; however, extending these approaches to multi-view settings remains challenging, often leading to severe view inconsistency. We propose \\textbf{Intrinsic Decomposition Transformer (IDT)}, a feed-forward framework for multi-view intrinsic image decomposition. By leveraging transformer-based attention to jointly reason over multiple input images, IDT produces view-consistent intrinsic factors in a single forward pass, without iterative generative sampling. IDT adopts a physically grounded image formation model that explicitly decomposes images into diffuse reflectance, diffuse shading, and specular shading. This structured factorization separates Lambertian and non-Lambertian light transport, enabling interpretable and controllable decomposition of material and illumination effects across views. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IDT achieves cleaner diffuse reflectance, more coherent diffuse shading, and better-isolated specular components, while substantially improving multi-view consistency compared to prior intrinsic decomposition methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faIDT\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u524d\u9988\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fa\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u591a\u5f20\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8fed\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u91c7\u6837\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5f62\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u53cd\u5c04\u7387\u3001\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u7167\u660e\u548c\u955c\u9762\u7167\u660e\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u6717\u4f2f\u4e0e\u975e\u6717\u4f2f\u5149\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6750\u6599\u4e0e\u5149\u7167\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u53cd\u5c04\u7387\u3001\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u7167\u660e\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u955c\u9762\u6210\u5206\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5355\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u91cd\u89c6\u56fe\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faIntrinsic Decomposition Transformer (IDT)\uff0c\u5229\u7528Transformer\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u8054\u5408\u5904\u7406\u591a\u5f20\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5f62\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u53cd\u5c04\u7387\u3001\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u7167\u660e\u548c\u955c\u9762\u7167\u660e\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u524d\u9988\u5f0f\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cIDT\u76f8\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u6e05\u6d01\u7684\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u53cd\u5c04\u7387\u3001\u66f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u7167\u660e\u4ee5\u53ca\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u955c\u9762\u6210\u5206\u5206\u79bb\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "IDT\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fa\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}
