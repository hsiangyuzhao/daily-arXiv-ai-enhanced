By leveraging an attack LLM to generate a high volume of diverse adversarial prompts and then fine-tuning this attack model with a preference dataset, Jailbreak-Zero achieves Pareto optimality across the crucial objectives of policy coverage, attack strategy diversity, and prompt fidelity to real user inputs. The empirical evidence demonstrates the superiority of this method, showcasing significantly higher attack success rates against both open-source and proprietary models like GPT-40 and Claude 3.5 when compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. Crucially, Jailbreak-Zero accomplishes this while producing human-readable and effective adversarial prompts with minimal need for human intervention, thereby presenting a more scalable and comprehensive solution for identifying and mitigating the safety vulnerabilities of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Jailbreak-Zero \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u7ea2\u961f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u53d7\u9650\u793a\u4f8b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6709\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u653b\u51fb\u578bLLM\u751f\u6210\u5927\u91cf\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5fae\u8c03\u653b\u51fb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u8986\u76d6\u3001\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cJailbreak-Zero \u5728\u653b\u51fb\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982GPT-40\u548cClaude 3.5\uff09\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u5f3a\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5168\u9762\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3LLM\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u624b\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u7a84\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u8f93\u5165\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u63d0\u793a\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u653b\u51fb\u578b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6d77\u91cf\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u653b\u51fb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u8986\u76d6\u3001\u653b\u51fb\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u4e0e\u95ed\u6e90\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728GPT-40\u548cClaude 3.5\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u6781\u5927\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u4ecb\u5165\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5168\u9762\u6027\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "Jailbreak-Zero \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u8d34\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u6a21\u578b\u6f5c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Open-source alternatives allow local inference but often require large model sizes that limit their use in resource-constrained clinical settings. Here, we benchmark two on-device LLMs, gpt-oss-20b and gpt-oss-120b, across three representative clinical tasks: general disease diagnosis, specialty-specific (ophthalmology) diagnosis and management, and simulation of human expert grading and evaluation. We compare their performance with state-of-the-art proprietary models (GPT-5 and o4-mini) and a leading open-source model (DeepSeek-R1), and we further evaluate the adaptability of on-device systems by fine-tuning gpt-oss-20b on general diagnostic data. Across tasks, gpt-oss models achieve performance comparable to or exceeding DeepSeek-R1 and o4-mini despite being substantially smaller. In addition, fine-tuning remarkably improves the diagnostic accuracy of gpt-oss-20b, enabling it to approach the performance of GPT-5. These findings highlight the potential of on-device LLMs to deliver accurate, adaptable, and privacy-preserving clinical decision support, offering a practical pathway for broader integration of LLMs into routine clinical practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e24\u6b3e\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08gpt-oss-20b \u548c gpt-oss-120b\uff09\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u773c\u79d1\u4e13\u79d1\u8bca\u7597\u53ca\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u5206\u6a21\u62df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u5ab2\u7f8e\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u90e8\u5206\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u7ecf\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1GPT-5\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u672c\u5730\u5316LLM\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u964d\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e13\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u5bf9\u4e91\u7aef\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b\u800c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u5927\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u5c0f\u578b\u4f46\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u672c\u5730\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f85\u52a9\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u6b3e\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u7684LLM\uff08gpt-oss-20b \u548c gpt-oss-120b\uff09\u5728\u4e09\u5927\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u901a\u7528\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u773c\u79d1\u4e13\u79d1\u8bca\u7597\u4e0e\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u5206\u6a21\u62df\uff1b\u5e76\u4e0eGPT-5\u3001o4-mini\u53caDeepSeek-R1\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9gpt-oss-20b\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u8bca\u65ad\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "result": "gpt-oss\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0eDeepSeek-R1\u548co4-mini\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u8fdc\u5c0f\u4e8e\u540e\u8005\uff1b\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684gpt-oss-20b\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1GPT-5\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9690\u79c1\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

smart and fast model that answers most questions, a deeper reasoning model for harder problems, and a real-time router that quickly decides which model to use based on conversation type, complexity, tool needs, and explicit intent (for example, if you say 'think hard about this' in the prompt). The router is continuously trained on real signals, including when users switch models, preference rates for responses, and measured correctness, improving over time. Once usage limits are reached, a mini version of each model handles remaining queries.\n  This system card focuses primarily on gpt-5-thinking and gpt-5-main, while evaluations for other models are available in the appendix. The GPT-5 system not only outperforms previous models on benchmarks and answers questions more quickly, but -- more importantly -- is more useful for real-world queries. We've made significant advances in reducing hallucinations, improving instruction following, and minimizing sycophancy, and have leveled up GPT-5's performance in three of ChatGPT's most common uses: writing, coding, and health. All of the GPT-5 models additionally feature safe-completions, our latest approach to safety training to prevent disallowed content.\n  Similarly to ChatGPT agent, we have decided to treat gpt-5-thinking as High capability in the Biological and Chemical domain under our Preparedness Framework, activating the associated safeguards.

However, as the number of erased concepts grows, these methods often become inefficient and ineffective, since each concept requires a separate set of fine-tuned parameters and may degrade the overall generation quality. In this work, we propose a supertype-subtype concept hierarchy that organizes erased concepts into a parent-child structure. Each erased concept is treated as a child node, and semantically related concepts (e.g., macaw, and bald eagle) are grouped under a shared parent node, referred to as a supertype concept (e.g., bird). Rather than erasing concepts individually, we introduce an effective and efficient group-wise suppression method, where semantically similar concepts are grouped and erased jointly by sharing a single set of learnable parameters. During the erasure phase, standard diffusion regularization is applied to preserve denoising process in unmasked regions. To mitigate the degradation of supertype generation caused by excessive erasure of semantically related subtypes, we propose a novel method called Supertype-Preserving Low-Rank Adaptation (SuPLoRA), which encodes the supertype concept information in the frozen down-projection matrix and updates only the up-projection matrix during erasure. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of SuPLoRA in mitigating generation performance degradation. We construct a more challenging benchmark that requires simultaneous erasure of concepts across diverse domains, including celebrities, objects, and pornographic content.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u7c7b\u578b-\u5b50\u7c7b\u578b\u6982\u5ff5\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u53c2\u6570\u8054\u5408\u64e6\u9664\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5355\u72ec\u5fae\u8c03\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5f15\u5165SuPLoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8d85\u7c7b\u578b\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u540d\u4eba\u3001\u7269\u4f53\u3001\u8272\u60c5\u5185\u5bb9\uff09\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u91cf\u6982\u5ff5\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u56e0\u9700\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u5355\u72ec\u5fae\u8c03\u53c2\u6570\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6982\u5ff5\u95f4\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u8d85\u7c7b\u578b-\u5b50\u7c7b\u578b\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5f52\u5165\u540c\u4e00\u7236\u8282\u70b9\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5206\u7ec4\u64e6\u9664\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u6807\u51c6\u6269\u6563\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4fdd\u7559\u672a\u63a9\u7801\u533a\u57df\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u63d0\u51faSuPLoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0a\u6295\u5f71\u77e9\u9635\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u4e0b\u6295\u5f71\u77e9\u9635\u7f16\u7801\u8d85\u7c7b\u578b\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u4fdd\u62a4\u6574\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u540c\u65f6\u64e6\u9664\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u56e0\u8fc7\u5ea6\u64e6\u9664\u5b50\u7c7b\u578b\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8d85\u7c7b\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u5206\u7ec4\u64e6\u9664\u4e0eSuPLoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u64e6\u9664\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

While policy ratio clipping stabilizes training, this heuristic hard constraint incurs a fundamental cost: it indiscriminately truncates gradients from high-return yet high-divergence actions, suppressing rare but highly informative \"eureka moments\" in complex reasoning. Moreover, once data becomes slightly stale, hard clipping renders it unusable, leading to severe sample inefficiency. In this work, we revisit the trust-region objective in policy optimization and show that explicitly constraining the \\emph{variance (second central moment) of the policy ratio} provides a principled and smooth relaxation of hard clipping. This distributional constraint stabilizes policy updates while preserving gradient signals from valuable trajectories. Building on this insight, we propose $R^2VPO$ (Ratio-Variance Regularized Policy Optimization), a novel primal-dual framework that supports stable on-policy learning and enables principled off-policy data reuse by dynamically reweighting stale samples rather than discarding them. We extensively evaluate $R^2VPO$ on fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and the openPangu-Embedded series (1B and 7B), across challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results show that $R^2VPO$ consistently achieves superior asymptotic performance, with average relative gains of up to 17% over strong clipping-based baselines, while requiring approximately 50% fewer rollouts to reach convergence.

This work provides practical insights for organizations deploying LLM-powered solutions and establishes benchmarks for instruction-following capabilities across major model families.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8613\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cRAG\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0cClaude-Sonnet-4\u548cGPT-5\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u2018\u6307\u4ee4\u5dee\u8ddd\u2019\u8fd9\u4e00\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5728\u901a\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u90e8\u7f72\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u90e8\u7f72LLM\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e3b\u8981\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u9075\u5faa\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u51c6\u6267\u884c\u7279\u5b9a\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6837\u672c\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5bf913\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u53ca\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5404\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dClaude-Sonnet-4\u548cGPT-5\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u3002\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u901a\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u6267\u884c\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u6307\u4ee4\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u51fa\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u2018\u6307\u4ee4\u5dee\u8ddd\u2019\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cRAG\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u53d7\u6307\u4ee4\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5373\u2018\u6307\u4ee4\u5dee\u8ddd\u2019\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u90e8\u5206\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u5982Claude-Sonnet-4\u548cGPT-5\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u5f3a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u6574\u4f53\u4ecd\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4f01\u4e1a\u5bf9\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u6027\u80fd\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7LLM\u5e94\u7528\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

This paper revisits a fundamental yet seldom systematically studied question: how VLM choice and competence translate to downstream VLA policies performance? We introduce VLM4VLA, a minimal adaptation pipeline that converts general-purpose VLMs into VLA policies using only a small set of new learnable parameters for fair and efficient comparison. Despite its simplicity, VLM4VLA proves surprisingly competitive with more sophisticated network designs. Through extensive empirical studies on various downstream tasks across three benchmarks, we find that while VLM initialization offers a consistent benefit over training from scratch, a VLM's general capabilities are poor predictors of its downstream task performance. This challenges common assumptions, indicating that standard VLM competence is necessary but insufficient for effective embodied control. We further investigate the impact of specific embodied capabilities by fine-tuning VLMs on seven auxiliary embodied tasks (e.g., embodied QA, visual pointing, depth estimation). Contrary to intuition, improving a VLM's performance on specific embodied skills does not guarantee better downstream control performance. Finally, modality-level ablations identify the visual module in VLM, rather than the language component, as the primary performance bottleneck. We demonstrate that injecting control-relevant supervision into the vision encoder of the VLM yields consistent gains, even when the encoder remains frozen during downstream fine-tuning. This isolates a persistent domain gap between current VLM pretraining objectives and the requirements of embodied action-planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u80fd\u529b\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u653f\u7b56\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u63d0\u51faVLM4VLA\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9002\u914d\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u975e\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VLM\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4ecd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5b9a\u5177\u8eab\u6280\u80fd\uff08\u5982\u89c6\u89c9\u6307\u5411\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff09\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0b\u6e38\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u5757\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5411\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6ce8\u5165\u63a7\u5236\u76f8\u5173\u76d1\u7763\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\u4fdd\u6301\u51bb\u7ed3\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u5177\u8eab\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u63a7\u5236\u9700\u6c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVLM4VLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u9002\u914d\u53c2\u6570\u5c06\u901a\u7528VLM\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3aVLA\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e03\u79cd\u8f85\u52a9\u5177\u8eab\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u6001\u7ea7\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "VLM\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u6e38\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u7279\u5b9a\u5177\u8eab\u6280\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u5757\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u63a7\u5236\u76f8\u5173\u76d1\u7763\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f9d\u7136\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dVLM\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u5177\u8eab\u52a8\u4f5c\u89c4\u5212\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5355\u7eaf\u4f9d\u8d56\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u652f\u6491\u9ad8\u6548\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e94\u52a0\u5f3a\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5bfc\u5411\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

Standard supervised fine-tuning often fails to strictly align linguistic outputs with visual evidence, while existing reinforcement learning approaches struggle with either prohibitive computational costs or limited exploration. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive framework for self-consistent radiology report generation. First, we conduct a systematic evaluation to identify optimal vision encoder and LLM backbone configurations for medical imaging. Building on this foundation, we introduce a novel \"Reason-then-Summarize\" architecture optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This framework restructures generation into two distinct components: a think block for detailed findings and an answer block for structured disease labels. By utilizing a multi-dimensional composite reward function, we explicitly penalize logical discrepancies between the generated narrative and the final diagnosis. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-CXR benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in clinical efficacy metrics and significantly reduces hallucinations compared to strong supervised baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u6d3d\u7684\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6700\u4f18\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08GRPO\uff09\u7684\u201c\u601d\u8003-\u603b\u7ed3\u201d\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u4e3a\u8be6\u7ec6\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bca\u65ad\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u7ef4\u590d\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u663e\u5f0f\u60e9\u7f5a\u53d9\u8ff0\u4e0e\u8bca\u65ad\u95f4\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e34\u5e8a\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u67b6\u6784\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e25\u683c\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bed\u8a00\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5219\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u6216\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6700\u4f18\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u914d\u7f6e\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u2018\u601d\u8003-\u603b\u7ed3\u2019\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u601d\u8003\u5757\u4e0e\u7b54\u6848\u5757\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u7ef4\u590d\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08GRPO\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728MIMIC-CXR\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u6709\u6548\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u9886\u5148\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5e7b\u89c9\u53d1\u751f\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u6d3d\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

This survey reviews progress across six key areas: transformer-based models, contrastive learning, domain-focused solutions, multi-modal methods, graph-based approaches, and knowledge-enhanced techniques. Recent transformer models such as FarSSiBERT and DeBERTa-v3 have achieved remarkable accuracy, while contrastive methods like AspectCSE have established new benchmarks. Domain-adapted models, including CXR-BERT for medical texts and Financial-STS for finance, demonstrate how STS can be effectively customized for specialized fields. Moreover, multi-modal, graph-based, and knowledge-integrated models further enhance semantic understanding and representation. By organizing and analyzing these developments, the survey provides valuable insights into current methods, practical applications, and remaining challenges. It aims to guide researchers and practitioners alike in navigating rapid advancements, highlighting emerging trends and future opportunities in the evolving field of STS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7efc\u8ff0\u7cfb\u7edf\u603b\u7ed3\u4e862021\u5e74\u4ee5\u6765\u8bed\u4e49\u6587\u672c\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff08STS\uff09\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u516d\u5927\u65b9\u5411\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6280\u672f\u3001\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u53ca\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u3002\u8fd1\u671f\u6a21\u578b\u5982FarSSiBERT\u548cDeBERTa-v3\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0cAspectCSE\u7b49\u5bf9\u6bd4\u65b9\u6cd5\u6811\u7acb\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u9886\u57df\u9002\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u5982CXR-BERT\u548cFinancial-STS\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u4e0e\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u77e5\u8bc6\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7efc\u8ff0\u68b3\u7406\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u5411\u6307\u5f15\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u671b\u672a\u6765\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e0e\u673a\u9047\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662fTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u6587\u672c\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff08STS\uff09\u7814\u7a76\u8fc5\u901f\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u5185\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u53d1\u5c55\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u68b3\u7406\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u4efd\u5168\u9762\u7efc\u8ff0\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u628a\u63e1\u6280\u672f\u6f14\u8fdb\u8109\u7edc\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u7a81\u7834\u4e0e\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u732e\u8c03\u7814\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f52\u7eb3\uff0c\u5bf9\u8fd1\u4e94\u5e74\u6765STS\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5de5\u4f5c\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u6574\u7406\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u516d\u7c7b\u4e3b\u8981\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u3001\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u4ee5\u53ca\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6280\u672f\u539f\u7406\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u9002\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u68b3\u7406\u51fa\u5f53\u524dSTS\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5404\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52a3\uff1b\u6307\u51fa\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u3001\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff1b\u5f3a\u8c03\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u878d\u5408\u662f\u672a\u6765\u91cd\u8981\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "STS\u7814\u7a76\u5df2\u8fdb\u5165\u6df1\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u5b9a\u5236\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u52a0\u5f3a\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u901a\u7528\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u591a\u6e90\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Existing compression methods, such as tinyBenchmarks depend critically on correctness labels from multiple historical models evaluated on the full test set, making them inapplicable in cold-start scenarios, such as the introduction of a new task, domain, or model with no prior evaluation history.\n  To address this limitation, we propose a history-free test set compression framework that requires no prior model performance data. Our method begins by fine-tuning a base LLM on a small amount of domain-specific data to internalize task-relevant semantics. It then generates high-level semantic embeddings for all original test samples using only their raw textual content. In this domain-adapted embedding space, we perform task-aware clustering and introduce a novel dataset X-ray mechanism that analyzes cluster geometry to dynamically calibrate the compression intensity based on the intrinsic redundancy of the benchmark.\n  Experiments on professional-domain dataset, notably a large-scale 3GPP communications benchmark, demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies and removes redundant samples, reducing evaluation cost by over 90% while preserving high fidelity to the full benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5386\u53f2\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7840\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u9636\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5728\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u578b\u6570\u636e\u96c6X-ray\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u538b\u7f29\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5197\u4f59\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc790%\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u4e3b\u6d41\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5386\u53f2\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u5148\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u7684\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7840\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u5438\u6536\u9886\u57df\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u9636\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b\u5728\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u805a\u7c7b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u6570\u636e\u96c6X-ray\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\u805a\u7c7b\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u538b\u7f29\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u57283GPP\u901a\u4fe1\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u51cf\u5c11\u8d85\u8fc790%\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u5168\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u65b0\u9886\u57df\u6216\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u4fdd\u969c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Previous approaches, such as rule-based systems, face significant limitations, including poor interpretability, inconsistent adherence to guidelines, and narrow domain applicability. To address this, we develop and validate CPGPrompt, an auto-prompting system that converts narrative clinical guidelines into large language models (LLMs).\n  Our framework translates CPGs into structured decision trees and utilizes an LLM to dynamically navigate them for patient case evaluation. Synthetic vignettes were generated across three domains (headache, lower back pain, and prostate cancer) and distributed into four categories to test different decision scenarios. System performance was assessed on both binary specialty-referral decisions and fine-grained pathway-classification tasks.\n  The binary specialty referral classification achieved consistently strong performance across all domains (F1: 0.85-1.00), with high recall (1.00 $\\pm$ 0.00). In contrast, multi-class pathway assignment showed reduced performance, with domain-specific variations: headache (F1: 0.47), lower back pain (F1: 0.72), and prostate cancer (F1: 0.77).

While existing LLMs can detect harmful or unsafe content, they often struggle with nuanced cases such as implicit offensiveness, subtle gender and racial biases, and jailbreak prompts, due to the subjective and context-dependent nature of these issues. Furthermore, their heavy reliance on training data can reinforce societal biases, resulting in inconsistent and ethically problematic outputs. To address these challenges, we introduce GuardEval, a unified multi-perspective benchmark dataset designed for both training and evaluation, containing 106 fine-grained categories spanning human emotions, offensive and hateful language, gender and racial bias, and broader safety concerns. We also present GemmaGuard (GGuard), a QLoRA fine-tuned version of Gemma3-12B trained on GuardEval, to assess content moderation with fine-grained labels. Our evaluation shows that GGuard achieves a macro F1 score of 0.832, substantially outperforming leading moderation models, including OpenAI Moderator (0.64) and Llama Guard (0.61). We show that multi-perspective, human-centered safety benchmarks are critical for reducing biased and inconsistent moderation decisions. GuardEval and GGuard together demonstrate that diverse, representative data materially improve safety, fairness, and robustness on complex, borderline cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGuardEval\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cGemmaGuard\uff08GGuard\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5185\u5bb9\u5b89\u5168\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7106\u4e2a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7c7b\u522b\u6db5\u76d6\u60c5\u7eea\u3001\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u6027\u522b\u79cd\u65cf\u504f\u89c1\u7b49\uff0cGGuard\u5728\u5b8fF1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u52300.832\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eOpenAI Moderator\uff080.64\uff09\u548cLlama Guard\uff080.61\uff09\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u3001\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u89c1\u4e0e\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9690\u6027\u5192\u72af\u3001\u5fae\u5999\u504f\u89c1\u53ca\u8d8a\u72f1\u63d0\u793a\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6613\u52a0\u5267\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5224\u65ad\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u4e0e\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u3001\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5185\u5bb9\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaGuardEval\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6106\u4e2a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7c7b\u522b\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528QLoRA\u5fae\u8c03Gemma3-12B\u5f97\u5230GemmaGuard\uff08GGuard\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5185\u5bb9\u5b89\u5168\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "GGuard\u5728\u5b8f\u89c2F1\u5f97\u5206\u4e0a\u8fbe\u52300.832\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eOpenAI Moderator\uff080.64\uff09\u548cLlama Guard\uff080.61\uff09\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u65e0\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002GuardEval\u4e0eGGuard\u5171\u540c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u591a\u89d2\u5ea6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u3001\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5411\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u516c\u6b63\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Crucially, can VLMs detect when a reasoning process is wrong and identify its error type? To answer this, we present MMErroR, a multi-modal benchmark of 2,013 samples, each embedding a single coherent reasoning error. These samples span 24 subdomains across six top-level domains, ensuring broad coverage and taxonomic richness. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on answer correctness, MMErroR targets a process-level, error-centric evaluation that requires models to detect incorrect reasoning and classify the error type within both visual and linguistic contexts. We evaluate 20 advanced VLMs, even the best model (Gemini-3.0-Pro) classifies the error in only 66.47\\% of cases, underscoring the challenge of identifying erroneous reasoning. Furthermore, the ability to accurately identify errors offers valuable insights into the capabilities of multi-modal reasoning models.

However, whether LFMs can provide truly personalized treatment recommendations remains an open question. Recent research has revealed multiple challenges for personalization, including the fundamental generalizability paradox: models achieving high accuracy in one clinical study perform at chance level in others, demonstrating that personalization and external validity exist in tension. This exemplifies broader contradictions in AI-driven healthcare: the privacy-performance paradox, scale-specificity paradox, and the automation-empathy paradox. As another challenge, the degree of causal understanding required for personalized recommendations, as opposed to mere predictive capacities of LFMs, remains an open question. N-of-1 trials -- crossover self-experiments and the gold standard for individual causal inference in personalized medicine -- resolve these tensions by providing within-person causal evidence while preserving privacy through local experimentation. Despite their impressive capabilities, this paper argues that LFMs cannot replace N-of-1 trials. We argue that LFMs and N-of-1 trials are complementary: LFMs excel at rapid hypothesis generation from population patterns using multimodal data, while N-of-1 trials excel at causal validation for a given individual. We propose a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of both to enable personalization and navigate the identified paradoxes: LFMs generate ranked intervention candidates with uncertainty estimates, which trigger subsequent N-of-1 trials. Clarifying the boundary between prediction and causation and explicitly addressing the paradoxical tensions are essential for responsible AI integration in personalized medicine.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08LFMs\uff09\u5728\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6cbb\u7597\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u9762\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u91cd\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u6096\u8bba\u3001\u9690\u79c1-\u6027\u80fd\u6096\u8bba\u3001\u89c4\u6a21\u7279\u5b9a\u6027\u6096\u8bba\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316-\u5171\u60c5\u6096\u8bba\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1LFMs\u80fd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u7fa4\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u66ff\u4ee3N-of-1\u8bd5\u9a8c\u5728\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7531LFMs\u751f\u6210\u5e26\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u5019\u9009\u5217\u8868\uff0c\u89e6\u53d1\u540e\u7eed\u7684N-of-1\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u786e\u8ba4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u3002\u5f3a\u8c03\u660e\u786e\u533a\u5206\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u6b63\u89c6\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6096\u8bba\uff0c\u662f\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u5730\u6574\u5408AI\u4e8e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u7597\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6cbb\u7597\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5982\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7814\u7a76\u95f4\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff08\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u6096\u8bba\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u4e14\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u524a\u5f31\u533b\u60a3\u5171\u60c5\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u5047\u8bbe\u53c8\u80fd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2a\u4f53\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u7597\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08LFMs\uff09\u4e0eN-of-1\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u5229\u7528LFMs\u5206\u6790\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4eba\u7fa4\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u5019\u9009\u65b9\u6848\u5e76\u9644\u5e26\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u6839\u636e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u65bd\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684N-of-1\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6096\u8bba\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u7fa4\u4f53\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u5230\u4e2a\u4f53\u56e0\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eLFMs\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5019\u9009\u65b9\u6848\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86N-of-1\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u79d1\u5b66\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e2a\u4f53\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684AI\u8f85\u52a9\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "LFMs\u4e0d\u80fd\u53d6\u4ee3N-of-1\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e92\u8865\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u53ea\u6709\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u56e0\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u771f\u6b63\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u533b\u7597\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u534f\u540c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u4e34\u5e8a\u843d\u5730\u3002"}}

This monograph provides a comprehensive and rigorous mathematical treatment of attention mechanisms, encompassing their theoretical foundations, computational properties, and practical implementations in contemporary deep learning systems. Applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal learning demonstrate the versatility of attention mechanisms. We examine language modeling with autoregressive transformers, bidirectional encoders for representation learning, sequence-to-sequence translation, Vision Transformers for image classification, and cross-modal attention for vision-language tasks. Empirical analysis reveals training characteristics, scaling laws that relate performance to model size and computation, attention pattern visualizations, and performance benchmarks across standard datasets. We discuss the interpretability of learned attention patterns and their relationship to linguistic and visual structures. The monograph concludes with a critical examination of current limitations, including computational scalability, data efficiency, systematic generalization, and interpretability challenges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5168\u9762\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u9610\u8ff0\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u53ca\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u3002\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u81ea\u56de\u5f52Transformer\u3001\u53cc\u5411\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u5e8f\u5217\u5230\u5e8f\u5217\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3001Vision Transformers\u4ee5\u53ca\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7b49\u5178\u578b\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u6027\u3001\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u6279\u5224\u6027\u5730\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5173\u952e\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u52a0\u6743\u51fd\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u76f8\u5173\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5173\u6ce8\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u8d28\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u4ecd\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u68b3\u7406\u4e0e\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e0e\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5bf9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u8003\u5bdf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5185\u5728\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u53cd\u6620\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff1b\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f3a\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5df2\u53d6\u5f97\u5de8\u5927\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u9700\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u6df1\u5316\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u5bfb\u6c42\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

This design can be accurate and interpretable, but it makes inference expensive on CPU because each layer requires many spline evaluations. Standard quantization toolchains are also hard to apply because the main computation is not a matrix multiply but repeated spline basis evaluation. This paper introduces LUT-KAN, a segment-wise lookup-table (LUT) compilation and quantization method for PyKAN-style KAN layers. LUT-KAN converts each edge function into a per-segment LUT with affine int8/uint8 quantization and linear interpolation. The method provides an explicit and reproducible inference contract, including boundary conventions and out-of-bounds (OOB) policies. We propose an ``honest baseline'' methodology for speed evaluation: B-spline evaluation and LUT evaluation are compared under the same backend optimization (NumPy vs NumPy and Numba vs Numba), which separates representation gains from vectorization and JIT effects. Experiments include controlled sweeps over LUT resolution L in 16, 32, 64, 128 and two quantization schemes (symmetric int8 and asymmetric uint8). We report accuracy, speed, and memory metrics with mean and standard deviation across multiple seeds. A two-by-two OOB robustness matrix evaluates behavior under different boundary modes and OOB policies. In a case study, we compile a trained KAN model for DoS attack detection (CICIDS2017 pipeline) into LUT artifacts.

In practical situations on inference tasks, the model's parameters have uncertainty because they are often learned from data, and thus we want to compute the degree of uncertainty in the inference outcome. One possible approach is to regard the inference outcome as a random variable by introducing distributions for the parameters and evaluate the variance of the outcome. Unfortunately, the tractability of computing such a variance is hardly known. Motivated by this, we consider the problem of computing the variance of WMC and investigate this problem's tractability. First, we derive a polynomial time algorithm to evaluate the WMC variance when the input is given as a structured d-DNNF. Second, we prove the hardness of this problem for structured DNNFs, d-DNNFs, and FBDDs, which is intriguing because the latter two allow polynomial time WMC algorithms. Finally, we show an application that measures the uncertainty in the inference of Bayesian networks. We empirically show that our algorithm can evaluate the variance of the marginal probability on real-world Bayesian networks and analyze the impact of the variances of parameters on the variance of the marginal.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper studies the computational complexity of variance in weighted model counting (WMC), showing that it can be computed efficiently only for structured d-DNNFs, despite WMC being tractable for broader classes.

Standard inference runtimes often incur significant overhead through high-level abstractions, dynamic dispatch, and unaligned memory access patterns. In this work, we present a novel \"Virtual Tensor Core\" architecture implemented in software, optimized specifically for ARM64 microarchitectures (Apple Silicon). By bypassing standard library containers in favor of direct memory mapping (mmap) and implementing hand-tuned NEON SIMD kernels, we achieve a form of \"Software-Defined Direct Memory Access (DMA).\" Our proposed Tensor Virtualization Layout (TVL) guarantees 100% cache line utilization for weight matrices, while our zero-copy loader eliminates initialization latency. Experimental results on a 110M parameter model demonstrate a stable throughput of >60 tokens/second on M2 hardware. While proprietary hardware accelerators (e.g., Apple AMX) can achieve higher peak throughput, our architecture provides a fully open, portable, and deterministic reference implementation for studying the memory bottleneck on general-purpose ARM silicon, meeting the 200ms psycholinguistic latency threshold without opaque dependencies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u201c\u865a\u62df\u5f20\u91cf\u6838\u5fc3\u201d\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9ARM64\u5fae\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5982Apple Silicon\uff09\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5185\u5b58\u6620\u5c04\uff08mmap\uff09\u548c\u624b\u5199NEON SIMD\u5185\u6838\uff0c\u89c4\u907f\u6807\u51c6\u5e93\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u201c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\uff08DMA\uff09\u201d\u3002\u5176\u5f20\u91cf\u865a\u62df\u5316\u5e03\u5c40\uff08TVL\uff09\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635100%\u7f13\u5b58\u884c\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u96f6\u62f7\u8d1d\u52a0\u8f7d\u5668\u6d88\u9664\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728M2\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c1.1\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u541e\u5410\u8d85\u8fc760 tokens/\u79d2\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3200ms\u5fc3\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f00\u6e90\u3001\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u3001\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u7814\u7a76\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u2018\u5185\u5b58\u5899\u2019\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u6570\u636e\u79fb\u52a8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8fdc\u8d85\u7b97\u672f\u5904\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u56e0\u9ad8\u5c42\u62bd\u8c61\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6d3e\u548c\u975e\u5bf9\u9f50\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u865a\u62df\u5f20\u91cf\u6838\u5fc3\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eARM64\uff08Apple Silicon\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528mmap\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f4\u63a5\u5185\u5b58\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u8df3\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u5e93\u5bb9\u5668\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u624b\u5199NEON SIMD\u5185\u6838\u52a0\u901f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5f20\u91cf\u865a\u62df\u5316\u5e03\u5c40\uff08TVL\uff09\u786e\u4fdd\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635100%\u7f13\u5b58\u884c\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u96f6\u62f7\u8d1d\u52a0\u8f7d\u5668\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "result": "\u5728M2\u82af\u7247\u4e0a\u5bf9110M\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a>60 tokens/second\u7684\u541e\u5410\u7387\uff1b\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u5668\uff08\u5982Apple AMX\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5177\u5907\u5b8c\u5168\u5f00\u6e90\u3001\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u3001\u65e0\u9690\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b\u6ee1\u8db3200ms\u5fc3\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u865a\u62df\u5f20\u91cf\u6838\u5fc3\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0aLLM\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528ARM\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63a8\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

Recent research has attempted to improve safety by training models to reason over safety rules before responding. However, a key issue lies in determining what form of safety reasoning effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, which is difficult to explicitly design or directly obtain. To address this, we propose \\textbf{STAR-S} (\\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{TA}ught \\textbf{R}easoning based on \\textbf{S}afety rules), a framework that integrates the learning of safety rule reasoning into a self-taught loop. The core of STAR-S involves eliciting reasoning and reflection guided by safety rules, then leveraging fine-tuning to enhance safety reasoning. Repeating this process creates a synergistic cycle. Improvements in the model's reasoning and interpretation of safety rules allow it to produce better reasoning data under safety rule prompts, which is then utilized for further training. Experiments show that STAR-S effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, outperforming baselines.

Stapleton"], "title": "A path to natural language through tokenisation and transformers", "comment": "19 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables", "summary": "Natural languages exhibit striking regularities in their statistical structure, including notably the emergence of Zipf's and Heaps' laws. Despite this, it remains broadly unclear how these properties relate to the modern tokenisation schemes used in contemporary transformer models. In this note, we analyse the information content (as measured by the Shannon entropy) of various corpora under the assumption of a Zipfian frequency distribution, and derive a closed-form expression for the slot entropy expectation value. We then empirically investigate how byte--pair encoding (BPE) transforms corpus statistics, showing that recursive applications of BPE drive token frequencies toward a Zipfian power law while inducing a characteristic growth pattern in empirical entropy. Utilizing the ability of transformers to learn context dependent token probability distributions, we train language models on corpora tokenised at varying BPE depths, revealing that the model predictive entropies increasingly agree with Zipf-derived predictions as the BPE depth increases. Attention-based diagnostics further indicate that deeper tokenisation reduces local token dependencies, bringing the empirical distribution closer to the weakly dependent (near IID) regime. Together, these results clarify how BPE acts not only as a compression mechanism but also as a statistical transform that reconstructs key informational properties of natural language.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u73b0\u4ee3Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u5982BPE\uff09\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7edf\u8ba1\u89c4\u5f8b\uff08\u5982Zipf\u5b9a\u5f8b\u548cHeaps\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u5728Zipf\u9891\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5185\u5bb9\uff08\u4ee5\u9999\u519c\u71b5\u8861\u91cf\uff09\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u69fd\u71b5\u7684\u671f\u671b\u503c\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u8bc1\u53d1\u73b0\u9012\u5f52\u5e94\u7528BPE\u4f1a\u4f7f\u8bcd\u9891\u8d8b\u5411\u4e8e\u5e42\u5f8b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u8d77\u7ecf\u9a8c\u71b5\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u957f\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540cBPE\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u968f\u7740BPE\u6df1\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\u9010\u6e10\u63a5\u8fd1\u7531Zipf\u5b9a\u5f8b\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u503c\u3002\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bca\u65ad\u4e5f\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u66f4\u6df1\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u8bcd\u5143\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5b9e\u9645\u5206\u5e03\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u5f31\u4f9d\u8d56\uff08\u8fd1\u4f3c\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\uff09\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u6574\u4f53\u63ed\u793a\u4e86BPE\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u538b\u7f29\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u66f4\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u91cd\u6784\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u53d8\u6362\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u73b0\u4ee3Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982BPE\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u8bed\u8a00\u7edf\u8ba1\u89c4\u5f8b\uff08\u5982Zipf\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff09\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63ed\u793a\u5206\u8bcd\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9999\u519c\u71b5\u5206\u6790\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u5728Zipf\u9891\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u69fd\u71b5\u671f\u671b\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76BPE\u9012\u5f52\u5e94\u7528\u5bf9\u8bcd\u9891\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u71b5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540cBPE\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u8bed\u6599\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5c40\u90e8\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "BPE\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u5e94\u7528\u4fc3\u4f7f\u8bcd\u9891\u8d8b\u4e8eZipf\u5e42\u5f8b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u7ecf\u9a8c\u71b5\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u589e\u957f\uff1b\u968f\u7740BPE\u6df1\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\u9010\u6e10\u903c\u8fd1\u57fa\u4e8eZipf\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u6df1\u5c42\u5206\u8bcd\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u8bcd\u5143\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5206\u5e03\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u8fd1\u4f3c\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\uff08near IID\uff09\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "BPE\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5177\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u8ba1\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u91cd\u6784\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u66f4\u6df1\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u8bed\u8a00\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002"}}

The architecture uses cross attention between spatial and frequency domain features along with a blood detection module to classify an image as real or fake. This paper aims to develop a unified architecture and provide insights into each step.

Furthermore, we reveal critical constraints: mixing long and short CoT data in training risks in premature saturation and collapse, while distillation into smaller models captures behavioral length but fails to replicate logical efficacy due to intrinsic capacity limits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u56db\u79cd\u884c\u4e3a\u539f\u578b\u5e76\u8bca\u65ad\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u957f\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u975e\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u6df7\u5408\u957f\u77ed\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u65e9\u9971\u548c\u4e0e\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u4e14\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\u65e0\u6cd5\u590d\u5236\u903b\u8f91\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u662f\u6e90\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u8fd8\u662f\u5355\u7eaf\u5197\u957f\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u3001\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u5f0f\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u4e2d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u3001\u5168\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8bc6\u522b\u884c\u4e3a\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8003\u5bdf\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5ef6\u957f\u751f\u6210\u957f\u5ea6\u5e76\u975e\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u6df7\u5408\u957f\u77edCoT\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u65e9\u9971\u548c\u4e0e\u5d29\u6e83\uff1b\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\u867d\u4fdd\u7559\u884c\u4e3a\u957f\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u590d\u73b0\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u771f\u6b63\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5408\u7406\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u589e\u52a0\u8f93\u51fa\u957f\u5ea6\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u800c\u975e\u6570\u91cf\u3002"}}

While classical path-planning algorithms, such as A* and Dijkstra, provide optimal solutions, their computational complexity limits real-time applicability in dynamic environments. We address this limitation by training machine learning and deep learning models on synthetic datasets generated from classical algorithm simulations. Our approach incorporates transformer-based and attention-based architectures that utilize weather heuristics to predict optimal next-node selections while accounting for meteorological conditions affecting drone operations. The attention mechanisms dynamically weight environmental factors including wind patterns, wind bearing, and temperature to enhance routing decisions under adverse weather conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our weather-aware models achieve significant computational speedup over traditional algorithms while maintaining route optimization performance, with transformer-based architectures showing superior adaptation to dynamic environmental constraints. The proposed framework enables real-time, weather-responsive route optimization for large-scale DaaS operations, representing a substantial advancement in the efficiency and safety of autonomous drone systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5929\u6c14\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u52a0\u901f\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5373\u670d\u52a1\uff08DaaS\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u7b97\u6cd5\u6a21\u62df\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u6743\u91cd\u98ce\u5411\u3001\u98ce\u901f\u3001\u6e29\u5ea6\u7b49\u6c14\u8c61\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u5929\u6c14\u4e0b\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8def\u5f84\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21DaaS\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u5929\u6c14\u54cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u8def\u5f84\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5982A*\u548cDijkstra\uff09\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5373\u670d\u52a1\uff08DaaS\uff09\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6c14\u8c61\u6761\u4ef6\u5bf9\u98de\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u54cd\u5e94\u53c8\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u5929\u6c14\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u8def\u5f84\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5982A*\uff09\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u751f\u6210\u5927\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u91c7\u7528Transformer\u53ca\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u98ce\u901f\u3001\u98ce\u5411\u3001\u6e29\u5ea6\u7b49\u6c14\u8c61\u4fe1\u606f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5404\u73af\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u6700\u4f18\u4e0b\u4e00\u8282\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5929\u6c14\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8def\u5f84\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5f53\u6c34\u5e73\uff1b\u5176\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u6c14\u8c61\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u73af\u5883\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u670d\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u8fd0\u884c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u662f\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u9886\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigate the problem in the scope of the emergent misalignment problem where LLMs can generalize patterns learned from misaligned content in one domain to another domain. We discover a strong causal relationship between metaphors in training data and the misalignment degree of LLMs' reasoning contents. With interventions using metaphors in pre-training, fine-tuning and re-alignment phases, models' cross-domain misalignment degrees change significantly. As we delve deeper into the causes behind this phenomenon, we observe that there is a connection between metaphors and the activation of global and local latent features of large reasoning models. By monitoring these latent features, we design a detector that predict misaligned content with high accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9690\u55bb\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u55bb\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u8de8\u57df\u63a8\u7406\u504f\u5dee\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u91cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u9636\u6bb5\u5e72\u9884\u9690\u55bb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u7a0b\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u9690\u55bb\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u6fc0\u6d3b\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u5185\u5bb9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u9690\u55bb\u662f\u5426\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u5c06\u4e00\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u91cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5165\u6216\u79fb\u9664\u9690\u55bb\u8fdb\u884c\u5e72\u9884\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u76d1\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u504f\u5dee\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u55bb\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u9884\u6d4b\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u9690\u55bb\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u8de8\u57df\u63a8\u7406\u504f\u5dee\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u5e72\u9884\u9690\u55bb\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8c03\u8282\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5dee\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff1b\u6240\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u80fd\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u9f50\u63a8\u7406\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9690\u55bb\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5f71\u54cd\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4e5f\u6df1\u523b\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u4e2d\u5f15\u53d1\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9690\u55bb\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

While the phenomenology of collapse is increasingly evident, rigorous methods to quantify and predict its onset in high-dimensional spaces remain elusive. In this paper, we introduce SIGMA (Spectral Inequalities for Gram Matrix Analysis), a unified framework that benchmarks model collapse through the spectral lens of the embedding Gram matrix. By deriving and utilizing deterministic and stochastic bounds on the matrix's spectrum, SIGMA provides a mathematically grounded metric to track the contraction of the representation space. Crucially, our stochastic formulation enables scalable estimation of these bounds, making the framework applicable to large-scale foundation models where full eigendecomposition is intractable. We demonstrate that SIGMA effectively captures the transition towards degenerate states, offering both theoretical insights into the mechanics of collapse and a practical, scalable tool for monitoring the health of recursive training pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSIGMA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5165Gram\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9012\u5f52\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u201c\u6a21\u578b\u574d\u7f29\u201d\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6027\u8c31\u754c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u8ffd\u8e2a\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u9000\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u7531\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u9012\u5f52\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u574d\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u5b66\u4e25\u8c28\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SIGMA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5d4c\u5165Gram\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u8c31\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u5176\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6027\u8c31\u754c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u6536\u7f29\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "SIGMA\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u6a21\u578b\u5411\u9000\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u574d\u7f29\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9012\u5f52\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u63a7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "SIGMA\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u574d\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u4e0a\u4e25\u8c28\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5206\u6790\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u9000\u5316\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u8b66\u4e0e\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We identify two alignment-induced biases in existing methods: a positive moral bias, where characters uniformly adopt agreeable stances (e.g. always saying lying is bad), and a helpful assistant bias, where characters invariably answer questions directly (e.g. never refusing or deflecting). While such tendencies suit instruction-following systems, they suppress dramatic tension and yield predictable characters, stemming from maximum likelihood training and assistant fine-tuning. To address this, we introduce PersonaWeaver, a framework that disentangles world-building (roles, demographics) from behavioral-building (moral stances, interactional styles), yielding characters with more diverse reactions and moral stances, as well as second-order diversity in stylistic markers like length, tone, and punctuation.

We propose visual word puzzles as a challenging alternative, as they require discovering implicit visual cues, generating and revising hypotheses, and mapping perceptual evidence to non-literal concepts in ways that are difficult to solve via literal grounding, OCR-heavy shortcuts, or simple retrieval-style matching. We introduce Eye-Q, a multilingual benchmark designed to assess this form of complex visual understanding. Eye-Q contains 1,343 puzzles in which a model observes a conceptually dense scene with a brief description and must infer a specific target word or phrase. The puzzles are intentionally unstructured and cue-implicit, with distractors and contextual relationships that demand selective attention, abstraction, and associative inference. The benchmark spans English, Persian, Arabic, and cross-lingual puzzles. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs using an open-ended, human-aligned protocol that probes hypothesis formation and revision under lightweight assistance. Results reveal substantial performance gaps, especially on abstract and cross-lingual puzzles, highlighting limitations in current models' ability to construct and search over appropriate conceptual representations for flexible image-to-phrase inference; maximum accuracy reaches only 60.27%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u89c6\u89c9\u8bcd\u8bed\u8c1c\u9898\uff08Visual Word Puzzles\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6df1\u5c42\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7684Eye-Q\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b1,343\u4e2a\u9700\u8981\u9690\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u8c1c\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u8981\u6c42\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u5bc6\u96c6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8054\u60f3\u63a8\u65ad\u76ee\u6807\u8bcd\u6216\u77ed\u8bed\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u9762\u7279\u5f81\u6216\u7b80\u5355\u68c0\u7d22\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u91c7\u7528\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u7684\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u62bd\u8c61\u4e0e\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec5\u4e3a60.27%\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u9002\u5f53\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u9762\u7279\u5f81\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4e3a\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u89c6\u89c9\u8bcd\u8bed\u8c1c\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u6311\u6218\u6a21\u578b\u8d85\u8d8a\u5b57\u9762\u610f\u4e49\u3001\u8fdb\u884c\u9690\u6027\u7ebf\u7d22\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u6982\u5ff5\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u6784\u5efaEye-Q\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b1,343\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u7ebf\u7d22\u9690\u542b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bcd\u8bed\u8c1c\u9898\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u8f7b\u91cf\u8f85\u52a9\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5047\u8bbe\u5f62\u6210\u4e0e\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728Eye-Q\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u62bd\u8c61\u4e0e\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8c1c\u9898\u4e0a\u5dee\u8ddd\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec560.27%\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u77ed\u8bed\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bcd\u8bed\u8c1c\u9898\u662f\u68c0\u9a8c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6df1\u5c42\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u9690\u6027\u7ebf\u7d22\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u6982\u5ff5\u62bd\u8c61\u4e0e\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6620\u5c04\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9700\u53d1\u5c55\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Currently, reasoning strategies are autonomously selected by LRMs themselves. However, such autonomous selection often produces inefficient or even erroneous reasoning paths. To make reasoning more reliable and flexible, it is important to develop methods for controlling reasoning strategies. Existing methods struggle to control fine-grained reasoning strategies due to conceptual entanglement in LRMs' hidden states. To address this, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose strategy-entangled hidden states into a disentangled feature space. To identify the few strategy-specific features from the vast pool of SAE features, we propose SAE-Steering, an efficient two-stage feature identification pipeline. SAE-Steering first recalls features that amplify the logits of strategy-specific keywords, filtering out over 99\\% of features, and then ranks the remaining features by their control effectiveness. Using the identified strategy-specific features as control vectors, SAE-Steering outperforms existing methods by over 15\\% in control effectiveness. Furthermore, controlling reasoning strategies can redirect LRMs from erroneous paths to correct ones, achieving a 7\\% absolute accuracy improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAEs\uff09\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5SAE-Steering\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRMs\uff09\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u56e0\u81ea\u4e3b\u9009\u62e9\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4f4e\u6548\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u8def\u5f84\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u89e3\u8026\u81f3\u72ec\u7acb\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7279\u5f81\u8bc6\u522b\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u5411\u91cf\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a7\u5236\u6548\u679c\uff08\u8d85\u8fc715%\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u9519\u8bef\u8def\u5f84\u8f6c\u5411\u6b63\u786e\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e26\u67657%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7edd\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5177\u5907\u7c7b\u4eba\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u81ea\u4e3b\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u751a\u81f3\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u63a7\u5e72\u9884\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea0\u7f20\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAEs\uff09\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u53bb\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u63d0\u51faSAE-Steering\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b56\u7565\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7b5b\u9009\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6389\u8d85\u8fc799%\u65e0\u5173\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u6839\u636e\u63a7\u5236\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5bf9\u5269\u4f59\u7279\u5f81\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u9009\u53d6\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u5411\u91cf\u4ee5\u5e72\u9884\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "SAE-Steering\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8d85\u8fc715%\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u907f\u5f00\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b07%\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7b56\u7565\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7SAE-Steering\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea0\u7f20\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, its use in clinical practice is limited by cost, turnaround time, and tissue requirements, thereby restricting its application in the management of PDAC. We introduce PanSubNet, an interpretable deep learning framework that predicts therapy-relevant molecular subtypes directly from standard H&E-stained WSIs. PanSubNet was developed using data from 1,055 patients across two multi-institutional cohorts (PANCAN, n=846; TCGA, n=209) with paired histology and RNA-seq data. Ground-truth labels were derived using the validated Moffitt 50-gene signature refined by GATA6 expression. The model employs dual-scale architecture that fuses cellular-level morphology with tissue-level architecture, leveraging attention mechanisms for multi-scale representation learning and transparent feature attribution. On internal validation within PANCAN using five-fold cross-validation, PanSubNet achieved mean AUC of 88.5% with balanced sensitivity and specificity. External validation on the independent TCGA cohort without fine-tuning demonstrated robust generalizability (AUC 84.0%). PanSubNet preserved and, in metastatic disease, strengthened prognostic stratification compared to RNA-seq based labels. Prediction uncertainty linked to intermediate transcriptional states, not classification noise.

In this work, we address the problem of data protection against unwanted model learning in a realistic black-box setting. We propose Disclaimer Injection, a novel data-level defence that renders text unlearnable to LLMs. Rather than relying on model-side controls or explicit data removal, our approach exploits the models' own alignment mechanisms: by injecting carefully designed alignment-triggering disclaimers to prevent effective learning. Through layer-wise analysis, we find that fine-tuning on such protected data induces persistent activation of alignment-related layers, causing alignment constraints to override task learning even on common inputs. Consequently, models trained on such data exhibit substantial and systematic performance degradation compared to standard fine-tuning. Our results identify alignment behaviour as a previously unexplored lever for data protection and, to our knowledge, present the first practical method for restricting data learnability at LLM scale without requiring access to or modification of the training pipeline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDisclaimer Injection\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7ea7\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5728\u9ed1\u7bb1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u514d\u53d7\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u5165\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u3001\u80fd\u89e6\u53d1\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u7684\u514d\u8d23\u58f0\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u6587\u672c\u65e0\u6cd5\u88ab\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u5c42\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u6b64\u7c7b\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u4f1a\u6301\u7eed\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5c42\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7ea6\u675f\u8986\u76d6\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u4e14\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u9f50\u884c\u4e3a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u65b0\u6760\u6746\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u6216\u4fee\u6539\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u5373\u53ef\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u4e2d\u9650\u5236\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u6d77\u91cf\u5f02\u6784\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u5bf9\u4e13\u6709\u6216\u4e2a\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u88ab\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u4fa7\u63a7\u5236\u6216\u6570\u636e\u79fb\u9664\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u9ed1\u7bb1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u65bd\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u6539\u6216\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u9053\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7ea7\u9632\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDisclaimer Injection\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u3001\u80fd\u591f\u89e6\u53d1\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u7684\u514d\u8d23\u58f0\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u56e0\u6301\u7eed\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bf9\u9f50\u76f8\u5173\u5c42\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u539f\u59cb\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u4e14\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u666e\u901a\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u4e5f\u53d7\u5230\u5bf9\u9f50\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u3002\u8fd9\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bf9\u9f50\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u9632\u62a4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u9996\u6b21\u63ed\u793a\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5207\u5b9e\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u9ed1\u7bb1\u6570\u636e\u7ea7\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Previous work has shown that increasing inference steps can disrupt safety mechanisms and lead MLLMs to generate attacker-desired harmful content. However, most existing attacks focus on increasing the complexity of the modified visual task itself and do not explicitly leverage the model's own reasoning incentives. This leads to them underperforming on reasoning models (Models with Chain-of-Thoughts) compared to non-reasoning ones (Models without Chain-of-Thoughts). If a model can think like a human, can we influence its cognitive-stage decisions so that it proactively completes a jailbreak? To validate this idea, we propose GAMBI} (Gamified Adversarial Multimodal Breakout via Instructional Traps), a novel multimodal jailbreak framework that decomposes and reassembles harmful visual semantics, then constructs a gamified scene that drives the model to explore, reconstruct intent, and answer as part of winning the game. The resulting structured reasoning chain increases task complexity in both vision and text, positioning the model as a participant whose goal pursuit reduces safety attention and induces it to answer the reconstructed malicious query. Extensive experiments on popular reasoning and non-reasoning MLLMs demonstrate that GAMBIT achieves high Attack Success Rates (ASR), reaching 92.13% on Gemini 2.5 Flash, 91.20% on QvQ-MAX, and 85.87% on GPT-4o, significantly outperforming baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGAMBIT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u6307\u4ee4\u9677\u9631\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5176\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b8c\u6210\u8d8a\u72f1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6fc0\u52b1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u5426\u901a\u8fc7\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8d8a\u72f1\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6709\u5bb3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u89e3\u91cd\u7ec4\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u53c2\u4e0e\u6e38\u620f\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u6ce8\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u6076\u610f\u56de\u7b54\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0cGAMBIT\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe92.13%\uff08Gemini 2.5 Flash\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GAMBIT\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6fc0\u53d1\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u52a8\u673a\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7ed5\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002"}}

We also introduce a comprehensive waterhemp dataset containing 10,264 annotated frames from 23 plants. On this benchmark, WeedRepFormer achieves 92.18% mIoU for segmentation and 81.91% accuracy for gender classification using only 3.59M parameters and 3.80 GFLOPs.

This paper presents an approach for architecting such systems using design patterns derived from enterprise distributed systems standards, formal methods, and industry practice. We classify these patterns into three tiers: LLM Agents (task-specific automation), Agentic AI (adaptive goal-seekers), and Agentic Communities (organizational frameworks where AI agents and human participants coordinate through formal roles, protocols, and governance structures). We focus on Agentic Communities - coordination frameworks encompassing LLM Agents, Agentic AI entities, and humans - most relevant for enterprise and industrial applications. Drawing on established coordination principles from distributed systems, we ground these patterns in a formal framework that specifies collaboration agreements where AI agents and humans fill roles within governed ecosystems. This approach provides both practical guidance and formal verification capabilities, enabling expression of organizational, legal, and ethical rules through accountability mechanisms that ensure operational and verifiable governance of inter-agent communication, negotiation, and intent modeling.

However, current safety evaluations often overestimate robustness because existing automated attacks are limited by restrictive assumptions. They typically rely on handcrafted priors or require white-box access for gradient propagation. We challenge these constraints by demonstrating that token-level iterative optimization can succeed without gradients or priors. We introduce RAILS (RAndom Iterative Local Search), a framework that operates solely on model logits. RAILS matches the effectiveness of gradient-based methods through two key innovations: a novel auto-regressive loss that enforces exact prefix matching, and a history-based selection strategy that bridges the gap between the proxy optimization objective and the true attack success rate. Crucially, by eliminating gradient dependency, RAILS enables cross-tokenizer ensemble attacks. This allows for the discovery of shared adversarial patterns that generalize across disjoint vocabularies, significantly enhancing transferability to closed-source systems. Empirically, RAILS achieves near 100% success rates on multiple open-source models and high black-box attack transferability to closed-source systems like GPT and Gemini.", "AI": {"tldr": "RAILS is a novel framework for adversarial jailbreak attacks on LLMs that operates without gradients or handcrafted priors by using token-level iterative optimization on model logits.

Existing memory systems largely follow two paradigms: explicit structured memories offer interpretability but often become brittle under long-context overload, while latent memory mechanisms are efficient and stable yet difficult to inspect. We propose LatentGraphMem, a memory framework that combines implicit graph memory with explicit subgraph retrieval. LatentGraphMem stores a graph-structured memory in latent space for stability and efficiency, and exposes a task-specific subgraph retrieval interface that returns a compact symbolic subgraph under a fixed budget for downstream reasoning and human inspection. During training, an explicit graph view is materialized to interface with a frozen reasoner for question-answering supervision. At inference time, retrieval is performed in latent space and only the retrieved subgraph is externalized.

The common practice of fully fine-tuning the vision encoder on driving datasets potentially limits its generalization by causing the model to specialize too heavily in the training data. This work challenges the necessity of this training paradigm. We propose FROST-Drive, a novel E2E architecture designed to preserve and leverage the powerful generalization capabilities of a pretrained vision encoder from a Vision-Language Model (VLM). By keeping the encoder's weights frozen, our approach directly transfers the rich, generalized world knowledge from the VLM to the driving task. Our model architecture combines this frozen encoder with a transformer-based adapter for multimodal fusion and a GRU-based decoder for smooth waypoint generation. Furthermore, we introduce a custom loss function designed to directly optimize for Rater Feedback Score (RFS), a metric that prioritizes robust trajectory planning. We conduct extensive experiments on Waymo Open E2E Dataset, a large-scale datasets deliberately curated to capture the long-tail scenarios, demonstrating that our frozen-encoder approach significantly outperforms models that employ full fine-tuning. Our results provide substantial evidence that preserving the broad knowledge of a capable VLM is a more effective strategy for achieving robust, generalizable driving performance than intensive domain-specific adaptation. This offers a new pathway for developing vision-based models that can better handle the complexities of real-world application domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFROST-Drive\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u51bb\u7ed3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u7559VLM\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u548c\u957f\u5c3e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728Waymo Open E2E\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u51bb\u7ed3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u9002\u5e94\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u65b0\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u8fd9\u79cd\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u5bfb\u627e\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caGRU\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u8def\u5f84\u70b9\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9488\u5bf9\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u53cd\u9988\u5206\u6570\uff08RFS\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728Waymo Open E2E\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFROST-Drive\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u548c\u7f55\u89c1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51bb\u7ed3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Across 12 models and 10 languages, these measures yield stable ``spectral fingerprints'' that expose discontinuities missed by standard evaluation.\n  We report four results. (1) Models undergoing specific curriculum transitions (e.g., code-to-chat) show an English-only, syntax-triggered connectivity failure on non-canonical constructions, reaching $\u0394\u03bb_2 \\approx -0.76$. We term this scar \\textit{Passive-Triggered Connectivity Collapse} (PTCC). Analysis of the Phi lineage reveals that PTCC appears and resolves across developmental stages, implicating brittle curriculum shifts rather than synthetic data per se. (2) PTCC reflects a specialization trade-off: strengthened formal routing at the expense of stylistic flexibility. (3) We identify four recurrent processing strategies; simple frozen-threshold rules enable perfect forensic identification across lineages. (4) Mechanistically, PTCC localizes to a sparse Layer 2 ``compensatory patch'' of heads that fails under syntactic stress; activation steering can partially restore connectivity, recovering $\\approx 38\\%$ of lost information flow.\n  Finally, dominant topological regimes track tokenization density more than language identity, suggesting ``healthy'' geometry varies systematically across scripts. Overall, attention-graph spectra provide a practical tool for auditing and training-regime verification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u673a\u5236\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u8c31\u8c31\u7279\u6027\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u5c42\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bcd\u5143\u56fe\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u8fde\u901a\u6027\uff08\u03bb\u2082\uff09\u3001\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\u548c\u8c31\u71b5\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u201c\u8c31\u6307\u7eb9\u201d\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8fc7\u6e21\uff08\u5982\u4ee3\u7801\u5230\u804a\u5929\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u51fa\u73b0\u82f1\u8bed\u4e13\u5c5e\u3001\u8bed\u6cd5\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\uff08PTCC\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u0394\u03bb\u2082 \u2248 -0.76\uff1b\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\u4e0e\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u672c\u8eab\u3002PTCC\u53cd\u6620\u5f62\u5f0f\u8def\u7531\u5f3a\u5316\u4e0e\u98ce\u683c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u51cf\u5f31\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u56db\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u9608\u503c\u89c4\u5219\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u7cfb\u5217\u7cbe\u51c6\u6eaf\u6e90\u3002\u673a\u5236\u4e0a\uff0cPTCC\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7b2c2\u5c42\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u201c\u8865\u507f\u5934\u201d\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5728\u53e5\u6cd5\u538b\u529b\u4e0b\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u7ea638%\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u66f4\u53d7\u5206\u8bcd\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u8eab\u4efd\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u201c\u5065\u5eb7\u201d\u51e0\u4f55\u5177\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002\u6574\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u8c31\u8c31\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5236\u5ea6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u884c\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\u4ec5\u80fd\u63cf\u8ff0\u6a21\u578b\u505a\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u5982\u4f55\u8fd0\u4f5c\u3002\u4e3a\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63a2\u9488\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6355\u6349\u6df1\u5c42\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u9690\u853d\u7f3a\u9677\u6216\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e00\u5c42\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bcd\u5143\u56fe\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5176\u4ee3\u6570\u8fde\u901a\u6027\uff08\u03bb\u2082\uff09\u3001\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\u548c\u8c31\u71b5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u2018\u8c31\u6307\u7eb9\u2019\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5f02\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6fc0\u6d3b\u64cd\u7eb5\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u89e3\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u673a\u5236\u6eaf\u6e90\u3002", "result": "1. \u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u82f1\u8bed\u4e13\u5c5e\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u89e6\u53d1\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\uff08PTCC\uff09\uff0c\u0394\u03bb\u2082 \u2248 -0.76\uff1b2.

To address this challenge, we introduce PCoA, an expert-annotated benchmark for medical aspect-based summarization with phrase-level context attribution. PCoA aligns each aspect-based summary with its supporting contextual sentences and contributory phrases within them. We further propose a fine-grained, decoupled evaluation framework that independently assesses the quality of generated summaries, citations, and contributory phrases. Through extensive experiments, we validate the quality and consistency of the PCoA dataset and benchmark several large language models on the proposed task. Experimental results demonstrate that PCoA provides a reliable benchmark for evaluating system-generated summaries with phrase-level context attribution.

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves accuracy but incurs prohibitive latency for real-time query correction. A potential solution is to output an answer before reasoning to reduce latency; however, under autoregressive decoding, the early answer is independent of subsequent reasoning, preventing the model from leveraging its reasoning capability to improve accuracy. To address this issue, we propose Sandwich Reasoning (SandwichR), a novel approach that explicitly aligns a fast initial answer with post-hoc reasoning, enabling low-latency query correction without sacrificing reasoning-aware accuracy. SandwichR follows an Answer-Reasoning-Answer paradigm, producing an initial correction, an explicit reasoning process, and a final refined correction. To align the initial answer with post-reasoning insights, we design a consistency-aware reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: a dedicated consistency reward enforces alignment between the initial and final corrections, while margin-based rejection sampling prioritizes borderline samples where reasoning drives the most impactful corrective gains. Additionally, we construct a high-quality query correction dataset, addressing the lack of specialized benchmarks for complex query correction. Experimental results demonstrate that SandwichR achieves SOTA accuracy comparable to standard CoT while delivering a 40-70% latency reduction, resolving the latency-accuracy trade-off in online search.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Sandwich Reasoning (SandwichR) \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 Answer-Reasoning-Answer \u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u67e5\u8be2\u7ea0\u6b63\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u6837\u672c\u4f18\u5148\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u521d\u59cb\u7b54\u6848\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u540e\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf CoT \u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSandwichR \u5728\u4fdd\u6301 SOTA \u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0 40-70% \u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u5728\u7ebf\u641c\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf-\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u67e5\u8be2\u7ea0\u6b63\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u641c\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u800c\u65e9\u671f\u8f93\u51fa\u7b54\u6848\u867d\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u540e\u7eed\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u53d1\u6325\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u54cd\u5e94\u53c8\u4fdd\u7559\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Sandwich Reasoning (SandwichR)\uff0c\u91c7\u7528 Answer-Reasoning-Answer \u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u7ed3\u6784\uff1a\u5148\u751f\u6210\u521d\u6b65\u7ea0\u6b63\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u518d\u8fdb\u884c\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u7ea0\u6b63\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u5f3a\u5236\u521d\u59cb\u4e0e\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fb9\u8ddd\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u67e5\u8be2\u7ea0\u6b63\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cSandwichR \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6 CoT \u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0 40-70% \u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7a81\u7834\u5b9e\u65f6\u641c\u7d22\u4e2d\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "conclusion": "SandwichR \u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u67e5\u8be2\u7ea0\u6b63\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

In this work, we question this assumption by introducing COMMITTEEAUDIT, a post hoc framework that analyzes routing behavior at the level of expert groups rather than individual experts. Across three representative models and the MMLU benchmark, we uncover a domain-invariant Standing Committee. This is a compact coalition of routed experts that consistently captures the majority of routing mass across domains, layers, and routing budgets, even when architectures already include shared experts. Qualitative analysis further shows that Standing Committees anchor reasoning structure and syntax, while peripheral experts handle domain-specific knowledge. These findings reveal a strong structural bias toward centralized computation, suggesting that specialization in Mixture of Experts models is far less pervasive than commonly believed. This inherent bias also indicates that current training objectives, such as load-balancing losses that enforce uniform expert utilization, may be working against the model's natural optimization path, thereby limiting training efficiency and performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCOMMITTEEAUDIT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790Mixture of Experts\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ec4\u7684\u8def\u7531\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u3001\u8de8\u5c42\u3001\u8de8\u8def\u7531\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u2018\u5e38\u4efb\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u2019\uff0c\u8be5\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u7531\u5c11\u6570\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4e86\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u8def\u7531\u6d41\u91cf\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660eMoE\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u8fdc\u4e0d\u5982\u666e\u904d\u8ba4\u4e3a\u7684\u90a3\u6837\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e14\u5f53\u524d\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\uff09\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u7136\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u76f8\u6096\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d28\u7591Mixture of Experts\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u8def\u7531\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u666e\u904d\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u652f\u6301\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCOMMITTEEAUDIT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ec4\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u8def\u7531\u884c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5728MMLU\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8def\u7531\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u8de8\u57df\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u2018\u5e38\u4efb\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u2019\uff0c\u5360\u636e\u4e3b\u8981\u8def\u7531\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u6838\u5fc3\u4e13\u5bb6\u8d1f\u8d23\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u8bed\u6cd5\uff0c\u5916\u56f4\u4e13\u5bb6\u5904\u7406\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u53ef\u80fd\u6291\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u7136\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "Mixture of Experts\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u88ab\u9ad8\u4f30\uff0c\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u5b58\u5728\u5411\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5f3a\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u80fd\u9002\u5f97\u5176\u53cd\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We visualize the learned embedding space to reveal the unsupervised emergence of semantic genre clusters, confirming that the model captures deep structural relationships solely from interaction data. Finally, we validate the system's practical utility in a cold-start scenario, introducing a tunable scoring parameter to manage the trade-off between popularity bias and personalized affinity effectively.

Previous work successfully demonstrated that automated planners, using general domain-independent heuristics, are able to generate personalized treatments, when the domain and problems are modeled using a general domain description language (\\pddlp). Unfortunately, this process was limited in practice to consider no more than seven medications. In clinical terms, this is a non-starter. In this paper, we explore the use of automatically-generated domain- and problem-specific heuristics to be used with general search, as a method of scaling up medication planning to levels allowing closer work with clinicians. Specifically, we specify the domain programmatically (specifying an initial state and a successor generation procedure), and use an LLM to generate a problem specific heuristic that can be used by a fixed search algorithm (GBFS). The results indicate dramatic improvements in coverage and planning time, scaling up the number of medications to at least 28, and bringing medication planning one step closer to practical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7279\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u901a\u7528\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08GBFS\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u836f\u7269\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c06\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u836f\u7269\u6570\u91cf\u4ece\u6700\u591a7\u79cd\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u81f3\u5c1128\u79cd\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u836f\u7269\u89c4\u5212\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u836f\u7269\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6700\u591a\u5904\u7406\u4e03\u79cd\u836f\u7269\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u9645\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6cbb\u7597\u65b9\u6848\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b9a\u4e49\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u540e\u7ee7\u72b6\u6001\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u9488\u5bf9\u5177\u4f53\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08GBFS\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u836f\u7269\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u836f\u7269\u6570\u91cf\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u836f\u7269\u79cd\u7c7b\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u81f3\u5c1128\u79cd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u89c4\u5212\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u89c4\u5212\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7531\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u7279\u5b9a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u901a\u7528\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u836f\u7269\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u5411\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u8fc8\u51fa\u5173\u952e\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

In recent years, there have been significant advances in evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for news video understanding. However, existing benchmarks largely focus on single-source, intra-video reasoning, where each report is processed in isolation. In contrast, real-world news consumption is inherently multi-sourced: the same event is reported by different outlets with complementary details, distinct narrative choices, and sometimes conflicting claims that unfold over time. Robust news understanding, therefore, requires models to compare perspectives from different sources, align multimodal evidence across sources, and synthesize multi-source information. To fill this gap, we introduce VNU-Bench, the first benchmark for multi-source, cross-video understanding in the news domain. We design a set of new question types that are unique in testing models' ability of understanding multi-source multimodal news from a variety of different angles. We design a novel hybrid human-model QA generation process that addresses the issues of scalability and quality control in building a large dataset for cross-source news understanding.

Experimenting with a newly constructed benchmark of 26K aspect-document pairs, we found that ASPECTSIM, when implemented with direct GPT-4o prompting, achieves substantially higher human-machine agreement ($\\approx$80% higher) than the same for holistic similarity without explicit aspects. These findings underscore the importance of explicitly accounting for aspects when measuring document similarity and highlight the need to revise standard practice. Next, we conducted a large-scale meta-evaluation using 16 smaller open-source LLMs and 9 embedding models with a focus on making ASPECTSIM accessible and reproducible. While directly prompting LLMs to produce ASPECTSIM scores turned out be ineffective (20-30% human-machine agreement), a simple two-stage refinement improved their agreement by $\\approx$140%.

Reinforcement learning (RL) has been investigated for improving the quality of image editing, but it faces three key challenges: (1) limited reasoning exploration confined to denoising stochasticity, (2) biased reward fusion, and (3) unstable VLM-based instruction rewards. In this work, we propose ThinkRL-Edit, a reasoning-centric RL framework that decouples visual reasoning from image synthesis and expands reasoning exploration beyond denoising. To the end, we introduce Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based reasoning sampling with planning and reflection stages prior to generation in online sampling, compelling the model to explore multiple semantic hypotheses and validate their plausibility before committing to a visual outcome. To avoid the failures of weighted aggregation, we propose an unbiased chain preference grouping strategy across multiple reward dimensions. Moreover, we replace interval-based VLM scores with a binary checklist, yielding more precise, lower-variance, and interpretable rewards for complex reasoning.

By accurately filtering deceptive reasoning samples, EntroCoT constructs a high-quality dataset where every intermediate step in each reasoning trace facilitates the final answer.

However, the effect of the grading scale itself remains underexplored. We study the LLM-as-a-judge problem by comparing two kinds of raters: humans and LLMs. We collect ratings from both groups on three scales and across six benchmarks that include objective, open-ended subjective, and mixed tasks. Using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) to measure absolute agreement, we find that LLM judgments are not perfectly consistent across scales on subjective benchmarks, and that the choice of scale substantially shifts human-LLM agreement, even when within-group panel reliability is high. Aggregated over tasks, the grading scale of 0-5 yields the strongest human-LLM alignment. We further demonstrate that pooled reliability can mask benchmark heterogeneity and reveal systematic subgroup differences in alignment across gender groups, strengthening the importance of scale design and sub-level diagnostics as essential components of LLM-as-a-judge protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u5668\u65f6\uff0c\u8bc4\u5206\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u8bc4\u5206\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u8bc4\u5206\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eLLM\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc4\u5206\u5c3a\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eLLM\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5185\u90e8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8f83\u9ad8\u30020-5\u5206\u5236\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b-LLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u63a9\u76d6\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u66b4\u9732\u51fa\u6027\u522b\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8bc4\u5206\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5b50\u7ec4\u8bca\u65ad\u5728LLM\u8bc4\u5206\u534f\u8bae\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u8bc4\u5206\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5206\u5458\u65f6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5176\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u8bc4\u5206\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff080-5\u30011-7\u30011-10\uff09\u4e0b\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u4e3b\u89c2\u53ca\u6df7\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ec4\u5185\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\uff08ICC\uff09\u8861\u91cf\u7edd\u5bf9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eLLM\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\uff08\u5982\u6027\u522b\uff09\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "LLM\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8de8\u8bc4\u5206\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8f83\u5dee\uff1b\u8bc4\u5206\u5c3a\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eLLM\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b0-5\u5206\u5236\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u4eba\u7c7b-LLM\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u805a\u5408\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u63a9\u76d6\u4efb\u52a1\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc4\u5206\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5206\u5458\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e94\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u8003\u91cf\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u9700\u5f00\u5c55\u5b50\u7ec4\u8bca\u65ad\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u6f5c\u5728\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing reward designs are often imperfect proxies for true human judgment, making models prone to reward hacking--producing unrealistic or low-quality images that nevertheless achieve high reward scores. In this work, we systematically analyze reward hacking behaviors in text-to-image (T2I) RL post-training. We investigate how both aesthetic/human preference rewards and prompt-image consistency rewards individually contribute to reward hacking and further show that ensembling multiple rewards can only partially mitigate this issue. Across diverse reward models, we identify a common failure mode: the generation of artifact-prone images. To address this, we propose a lightweight and adaptive artifact reward model, trained on a small curated dataset of artifact-free and artifact-containing samples. This model can be integrated into existing RL pipelines as an effective regularizer for commonly used reward models. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating our artifact reward significantly improves visual realism and reduces reward hacking across multiple T2I RL setups, demonstrating the effectiveness of lightweight reward augment serving as a safeguard against reward hacking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\uff08T2I\uff09\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6b3a\u9a97\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7f8e\u5b66/\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u63d0\u793a-\u56fe\u50cf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u5747\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u751f\u6210\u542b\u4f2a\u5f71\u7684\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u5956\u52b1\u53ef\u90e8\u5206\u7f13\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u6839\u9664\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c11\u91cf\u7cbe\u5fc3\u7b5b\u9009\u7684\u6837\u672c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5956\u52b1\u6b3a\u9a97\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2aT2I\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u4f46\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6216\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff08\u5373\u5956\u52b1\u6b3a\u9a97\uff09\u3002\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7f8e\u5b66\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u542b\u6709\u4f2a\u5f71\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e25\u91cd\u635f\u5bb3\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u6b64\u7c7b\u4f2a\u5f71\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "1. \u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7f8e\u5b66\u5956\u52b1\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5956\u52b1\uff09\u5728T2I RL\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u6b3a\u9a97\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b2. \u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5171\u540c\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u751f\u6210\u5927\u91cf\u542b\u4f2a\u5f71\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5305\u542b\u6709\u4f2a\u5f71\u4e0e\u65e0\u4f2a\u5f71\u6837\u672c\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b4. \u5c06\u8be5\u4f2a\u5f71\u5956\u52b1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u5219\u9879\u96c6\u6210\u81f3\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u60e9\u7f5a\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u5f71\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u540e\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5956\u52b1\u6b3a\u9a97\u73b0\u8c61\u660e\u663e\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u5728\u4f55\u79cd\u57fa\u7840\u5956\u52b1\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5065\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u5d4c\u5165\u73b0\u6709RL\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5956\u52b1\u6b3a\u9a97\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4f2a\u5f71\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u4f2a\u5f71\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

We study budgeted inference-time reasoning for multiple tasks under a strict global token constraint and formalize it as a Ordered Stochastic Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem(OS-MCKP). This perspective highlights a meta-cognitive requirement -- anticipating task difficulty, estimating return over investment (ROI), and allocating computation strategically. We propose ROI-Reasoning, a two-stage framework that endows LLMs with intrinsic, budget-aware rationality. In the first stage, Meta-Cognitive Fine-Tuning teaches models to predict reasoning cost and expected utility before generation, enabling explicit solve-or-skip decisions. Next, Rationality-Aware Reinforcement Learning optimizes sequential decision making under a hard token budget, allowing models to learn long-horizon allocation strategies.

Previous studies have employed machine learning and deep learning techniques, which often result in low feature optimization, thereby compromising both high performance and interpretability. To fill these voids, this paper proposes a hybrid approach to driver behavior analysis that uses a 12,857-row and 18-column data set taken from Kaggle. After applying preprocessing techniques such as label encoding, random oversampling, and standard scaling, 13 machine learning algorithms were tested. The Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of 95%.

While zero-shot prompting performs near chance, linear probes improve average F1 from 0.15-0.26 to 0.61-0.67, often matching or exceeding specialized time series models. Layer-wise analyses further show that class-discriminative time series information emerges in early transformer layers and is amplified by visual and multimodal inputs.

While existing research focuses on mitigating language priors or high-level statistical biases, they often overlook the internal complexities of the visual encoding process. We identify that visual statistical bias, arising from the inherent Bag-of-Patches behavior of Vision Encoders under weak structural supervision, acts as a contributing factor of object hallucinations. Under this bias, models prioritize local texture features within individual patches over holistic geometric structures. This tendency may induce spurious visual confidence and result in hallucinations. To address this, we introduce a training-free algorithm called Structure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding (SDCD), which performs contrastive calibration of the output distribution by introducing a shuffled structure-disrupted view. By penalizing tokens that maintain high confidence under this structure-less view, SDCD effectively suppresses the texture-driven bias. Experimental results demonstrate that SDCD significantly mitigates hallucinations across multiple benchmarks and enhances the overall multimodal capabilities of LVLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5SDCD\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7f13\u89e3\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u7834\u574f\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u7531\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c40\u90e8\u7eb9\u7406\u504f\u597d\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u8bef\u5224\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u6216\u9ad8\u5c42\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u89c6\u89c9\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\u5bf9\u7269\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStructure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding (SDCD)\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u7834\u574f\u7684\u89c6\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u60e9\u7f5a\u5728\u65e0\u7ed3\u6784\u89c6\u56fe\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6291\u5236\u7eb9\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSDCD\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7269\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\uff0cSDCD\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

The developed tool is intended to support legal experts during the criminal trial phase by providing reasoning and possible legal outcomes. The methodology involves analyzing and encoding articles of the ICC in ASP, including \"crimes against the person\" and property offenses. The resulting model is validated on a set of previous verdicts and refined as necessary. During the encoding process, contradictions may arise; these are properly handled by the system, which also generates possible decisions for new cases and provides explanations through a tool that leverages the \"supportedness\" of stable models. The automatic explainability offered by the tool can also be used to clarify the logic behind judicial decisions, making the decision-making process more interpretable.

Existing medical question answering benchmarks primarily emphasize clinical knowledge or patient-level reasoning, yet few systematically evaluate evidence-grounded epidemiological inference. We present EpiQAL, the first diagnostic benchmark for epidemiological question answering across diverse diseases, comprising three subsets built from open-access literature. The subsets respectively evaluate text-grounded factual recall, multi-step inference linking document evidence with epidemiological principles, and conclusion reconstruction with the Discussion section withheld. Construction combines expert-designed taxonomy guidance, multi-model verification, and retrieval-based difficulty control. Experiments on ten open models reveal that current LLMs show limited performance on epidemiological reasoning, with multi-step inference posing the greatest challenge. Model rankings shift across subsets, and scale alone does not predict success. Chain-of-Thought prompting benefits multi-step inference but yields mixed results elsewhere. EpiQAL provides fine-grained diagnostic signals for evidence grounding, inferential reasoning, and conclusion reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "EpiQAL\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u79cd\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6587\u672c\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u56de\u5fc6\u3001\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u53ca\u7ed3\u8bba\u91cd\u6784\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u6311\u6218\u6700\u5927\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u53d7\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u89c4\u6a21\u5e76\u975e\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u5b66\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u4e34\u5e8a\u77e5\u8bc6\u6216\u60a3\u8005\u5c42\u9762\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f00\u653e\u6587\u732e\u6784\u5efa\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8b\u5b9e\u56de\u5fc6\u3001\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7ed3\u8bba\u91cd\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5341\u79cd\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u6700\u96be\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u6392\u540d\u968f\u5b50\u96c6\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0d\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4ed6\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u3002", "conclusion": "EpiQAL\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc1\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7ed3\u8bba\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Our technology facilitates any user to accurately drive the facial expressions of virtual characters in a non-intrusive manner and without the need of a lengthy calibration step. At the core of our system is a distillation based approach to train a machine learning model on heterogeneous data and labels coming form multiple sources, \\eg synthetic and real images.

Mainstream pass/fail outcome rewards enforce functional correctness via executing unit tests, but the resulting sparsity limits potential performance gains. While recent work has explored external Reward Models (RM) to generate richer, continuous rewards, the learned RMs suffer from reward misalignment and prohibitive computational cost. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{VeRPO} (\\textbf{V}erifiable D\\textbf{e}nse \\textbf{R}eward \\textbf{P}olicy \\textbf{O}ptimization), a novel RL framework for code generation that synthesizes \\textit{robust and dense rewards fully grounded in verifiable execution feedback}. The core idea of VeRPO is constructing dense rewards from weighted partial success: by dynamically estimating the difficulty weight of each unit test based on the execution statistics during training, a dense reward is derived from the sum of weights of the passed unit tests. To solidify the consistency between partial success and end-to-end functional correctness, VeRPO further integrates the dense signal with global execution outcomes, establishing a robust and dense reward paradigm relying solely on verifiable execution feedback. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and settings demonstrate that VeRPO consistently outperforms outcome-driven and RM-based baselines, achieving up to +8.83\\% gain in pass@1 with negligible time cost (< 0.02\\%) and zero GPU memory overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "VeRPO\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6267\u884c\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96be\u5ea6\u6743\u91cd\u5e76\u52a0\u6743\u90e8\u5206\u6210\u529f\u6765\u751f\u6210\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u6267\u884c\u7ed3\u679c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e0e\u6700\u7ec8\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u679c\u6216\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe8.83%\u7684pass@1\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3b\u6d41\u7684\u901a\u8fc7\u6267\u884c\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u901a\u8fc7/\u5931\u8d25\u5956\u52b1\u5b58\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u5956\u52b1\u9519\u4f4d\u548c\u9ad8\u6602\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u53c8\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4e14\u4e0e\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "VeRPO\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5404\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5c06\u901a\u8fc7\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6309\u6743\u91cd\u52a0\u603b\u751f\u6210\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6b64\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u6267\u884c\u7ed3\u679c\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6267\u884c\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cVeRPO\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u679c\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728pass@1\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u53478.83%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u65f6\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\u4f4e\u4e8e0.02%\uff0c\u65e0\u989d\u5916GPU\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "VeRPO\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e14\u4e0e\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6267\u884c\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Despite its importance, the task remains challenging due to the complexity of defining topic boundaries, the variability in discourse structure, and the need to balance local coherence with global context. These difficulties hinder downstream applications such as summarization, information retrieval, and question answering. In this work, we introduce SegNSP, framing linear text segmentation as a next sentence prediction (NSP) task. Although NSP has largely been abandoned in modern pre-training, its explicit modeling of sentence-to-sentence continuity makes it a natural fit for detecting topic boundaries. We propose a label-agnostic NSP approach, which predicts whether the next sentence continues the current topic without requiring explicit topic labels, and enhance it with a segmentation-aware loss combined with harder negative sampling to better capture discourse continuity. Unlike recent proposals that leverage NSP alongside auxiliary topic classification, our approach avoids task-specific supervision. We evaluate our model against established baselines on two datasets, CitiLink-Minutes, for which we establish the first segmentation benchmark, and WikiSection. On CitiLink-Minutes, SegNSP achieves a B-$F_1$ of 0.79, closely aligning with human-annotated topic transitions, while on WikiSection it attains a B-F$_1$ of 0.65, outperforming the strongest reproducible baseline, TopSeg, by 0.17 absolute points. These results demonstrate competitive and robust performance, highlighting the effectiveness of modeling sentence-to-sentence continuity for improving segmentation quality and supporting downstream NLP applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSegNSP\uff0c\u5c06\u7ebf\u6027\u6587\u672c\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u53e5\u5b50\u9884\u6d4b\uff08NSP\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5229\u7528NSP\u5bf9\u53e5\u5b50\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bdd\u9898\u8fb9\u754c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u7684NSP\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5206\u5272\u611f\u77e5\u635f\u5931\u53ca\u66f4\u96be\u7684\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u91c7\u6837\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5728CitiLink-Minutes\u548cWikiSection\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728CitiLink-Minutes\u4e0a\u8fbe\u52300.79\u7684B-F1\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ebf\u6027\u6587\u672c\u5206\u5272\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u957f\u671f\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u8bdd\u9898\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u590d\u6742\u3001\u8bdd\u8bed\u7ed3\u6784\u591a\u53d8\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c40\u90e8\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u6458\u8981\u751f\u6210\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u989d\u5916\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u76d1\u7763\u6216\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u8bdd\u9898\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6807\u7b7e\u65e0\u5173\u7684NSP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u5206\u5272\u89c6\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u4e00\u53e5\u5b50\u662f\u5426\u5ef6\u7eed\u5f53\u524d\u8bdd\u9898\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5272\u611f\u77e5\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u66f4\u96be\u7684\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bed\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u7684\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u4f55\u989d\u5916\u7684\u8bdd\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5728CitiLink-Minutes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f970.79\u7684B-F1\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u9996\u4e2a\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b\u5728WikiSection\u4e0a\u8fbe\u52300.65\u7684B-F1\uff0c\u6bd4\u6700\u5f3a\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u57fa\u7ebfTopSeg\u9ad8\u51fa0.17\u7edd\u5bf9\u70b9\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u5206\u5272\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u53e5\u5b50\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5272\u611f\u77e5\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u56f0\u96be\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6bb5\u843d\u8fb9\u754c\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6807\u6ce8\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u6e38NLP\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Under review", "summary": "Semantic segmentation on point clouds is critical for 3D scene understanding. However, sparse and irregular point distributions provide limited appearance evidence, making geometry-only features insufficient to distinguish objects with similar shapes but distinct appearances (e.g., color, texture, material). We propose Gaussian-to-Point (G2P), which transfers appearance-aware attributes from 3D Gaussian Splatting to point clouds for more discriminative and appearance-consistent segmentation. Our G2P address the misalignment between optimized Gaussians and original point geometry by establishing point-wise correspondences.

Among other things, explainablility for deep neural networks has been a topic of intensive research due to the meteoric rise in prominence of deep neural networks and their \"black-box\" nature. xAI approaches can be characterized along different dimensions such as their scope (global versus local explanations) or underlying methodologies (statistic-based versus rule-based strategies). Methods generating global explanations aim to provide reasoning process applicable to all possible output classes while local explanation methods focus only on a single, specific class. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a well-known statistical technique, identifies important features of a network. Deep neural network rule extraction method constructs IF-THEN rules that link input conditions to a class. Another approach focuses on generating counterfactuals which help explain how small changes to an input can affect the model's predictions. However, these techniques primarily focus on the input-output relationship and thus neglect the structure of the network in explanation generation.   In this work, we propose xDNN(ASP), an explanation generation system for deep neural networks that provides global explanations. Given a neural network model and its training data, xDNN(ASP) extracts a logic program under answer set semantics that-in the ideal case-represents the trained model, i.e., answer sets of the extracted program correspond one-to-one to input-output pairs of the network. We demonstrate experimentally, using two synthetic datasets, that not only the extracted logic program maintains a high-level of accuracy in the prediction task, but it also provides valuable information for the understanding of the model such as the importance of features as well as the impact of hidden nodes on the prediction. The latter can be used as a guide for reducing the number of nodes used in hidden layers, i.e., providing a means for optimizing the network.", "AI": {"tldr": "xDNN(ASP) is a novel explainable AI system for deep neural networks that generates global explanations by extracting a logic program under answer set semantics.

To solve this while retaining spherical geometry, we first introduce a designable Green's function framework (DGF) to provide new spherical operator solution strategy: Design systematic Green's functions under rotational group. Based on DGF, to model biological heterogeneity, we propose Green's-Function Spherical Neural Operator (GSNO) fusing 3 operator solutions: (1) Equivariant Solution derived from Equivariant Green's Function for symmetry-consistent modeling; (2) Invariant Solution derived from Invariant Green's Function to eliminate nuisance heterogeneity, e.g., consistent background field; (3) Anisotropic Solution derived from Anisotropic Green's Function to model anisotropic systems, especially fibers with preferred direction. Therefore, the resulting model, GSNO can adapt to real-world heterogeneous systems with nuisance variability and anisotropy while retaining spectral efficiency.

Based on this analysis, a systematic paradigm is proposed, wherein imputation strategies are tailored to the nature of specific features and the duration of missing intervals. The review concludes by emphasizing the importance of investigating the temporal dynamics of individual features and the implementation of multiple, feature-specific imputation techniques to effectively address heterogeneous temporal patterns inherent in the data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u6162\u6027\u75c5\uff08\u5982\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\uff09\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u4f4e\u8840\u7cd6\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8fde\u7eed\u76d1\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u5728\u4fe1\u53f7\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u63d2\u8865\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u533b\u7597\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\u957f\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u63d2\u8865\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3b\u5f20\u6839\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u7b56\u7565\u63d2\u8865\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6162\u6027\u75c5\u5982\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u7ba1\u7406\u9762\u4e34\u4f4e\u8840\u7cd6\u7b49\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u53ca\u65f6\u9884\u8b66\uff1b\u5c3d\u7ba1\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fde\u7eed\u76d1\u6d4b\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4fe1\u53f7\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u9891\u7e41\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u6027\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u79cd\u63d2\u8865\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5f53\u524d\u5148\u8fdb\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u53ca\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6309\u7279\u5f81\u7279\u6027\u548c\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\u957f\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u63d2\u8865\u7b56\u7565\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5355\u4e00\u63d2\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u7f3a\u5931\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u591a\u7b56\u7565\u63d2\u8865\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u8840\u7cd6\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u4f4e\u8840\u7cd6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u5404\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u65bd\u591a\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u63d2\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, most existing approaches treat culture as static background knowledge, overlooking its dynamic and evolving nature. This limitation reduces their reliability in downstream tasks that demand genuine cultural sensitivity. In this work, we introduce CALM, a novel framework designed to endow language models with cultural self-awareness. CALM disentangles task semantics from explicit cultural concepts and latent cultural signals, shaping them into structured cultural clusters through contrastive learning. These clusters are then aligned via cross-attention to establish fine-grained interactions among related cultural features and are adaptively integrated through a Mixture-of-Experts mechanism along culture-specific dimensions. The resulting unified representation is fused with the model's original knowledge to construct a culturally grounded internal identity state, which is further enhanced through self-prompted reflective learning, enabling continual adaptation and self-correction. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple cross-cultural benchmark datasets demonstrate that CALM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "CALM \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8d4b\u4e88\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6587\u5316\u81ea\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u663e\u6027\u6587\u5316\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u6587\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5e76\u5f62\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u6587\u5316\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u6587\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u673a\u5236\u6309\u6587\u5316\u7279\u5b9a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u6587\u5316\u6839\u57fa\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8eab\u4efd\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u63d0\u793a\u53cd\u601d\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u4e0e\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u3002\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCALM \u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6587\u5316\u89c6\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u80cc\u666f\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u53d8\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u9700\u8981\u771f\u6b63\u6587\u5316\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u6587\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6587\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "CALM \u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u8026\u4efb\u52a1\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u6587\u5316\u6982\u5ff5\u53ca\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u5316\u805a\u7c7b\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5efa\u7acb\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6587\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7 Mixture-of-Experts \u673a\u5236\u5728\u6587\u5316\u7279\u5b9a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u878d\u5408\u539f\u59cb\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6587\u5316\u6839\u57fa\u5185\u90e8\u8eab\u4efd\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u63d0\u793a\u53cd\u601d\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u4e0e\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCALM \u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6587\u5316\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CALM \u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6587\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u771f\u6b63\u5177\u5907\u6587\u5316\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, existing methods typically compress optical features to match thermal feature dimensions for cross-modal alignment and fusion, which not only causes the loss of high-frequency information that is beneficial for thermal super-resolution, but also introduces physically inconsistent artifacts such as texture distortions and edge blurring by overlooking differences in the imaging physics between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose PCNet to achieve cross-resolution mutual enhancement between optical and thermal modalities, while physically constraining the optical guidance process via thermal conduction to enable robust thermal UAV image super-resolution. In particular, we design a Cross-Resolution Mutual Enhancement Module (CRME) to jointly optimize thermal image super-resolution and optical-to-thermal modality conversion, facilitating effective bidirectional feature interaction across resolutions while preserving high-frequency optical priors.

Early and accurate identification of failure zones in landslide-prone areas is crucial for effective geohazard mitigation. While existing approaches typically rely on surface displacement data analyzed through statistical or machine learning techniques, they often fall short in capturing both the spatial correlations and temporal dynamics that are inherent in such data. To address this gap, we focus on ground-monitored landslides and introduce a novel approach that jointly incorporates spatial and temporal information, enabling the detection of complex landslides and including multiple successive failures occurring in distinct areas of the same slope. To be specific, our method builds upon an existing LID-based technique, known as sLID. We extend its capabilities in three key ways. (1) Kinematic enhancement: we incorporate velocity into the sLID computation to better capture short-term temporal dependencies and deformation rate relationships. (2) Spatial fusion: we apply Bayesian estimation to aggregate sLID values across spatial neighborhoods, effectively embedding spatial correlations into the LID scores. (3) Temporal modeling: we introduce a temporal variant, tLID, that learns long-term dynamics from time series data, providing a robust temporal representation of displacement behavior.

In this paper, we propose CloudMatch, a semi-supervised framework that effectively leverages unlabeled remote sensing imagery through view-consistency learning combined with scene-mixing augmentations. An observation behind CloudMatch is that cloud patterns exhibit structural diversity and contextual variability across different scenes and within the same scene category. Our key insight is that enforcing prediction consistency across diversely augmented views, incorporating both inter-scene and intra-scene mixing, enables the model to capture the structural diversity and contextual richness of cloud patterns. Specifically, CloudMatch generates one weakly augmented view along with two complementary strongly augmented views for each unlabeled image: one integrates inter-scene patches to simulate contextual variety, while the other employs intra-scene mixing to preserve semantic coherence. This approach guides pseudolabel generation and enhances generalization.

Their core mechanisms, Top-k routing and auxiliary load balancing, remain heuristic, however, lacking a cohesive theoretical underpinning to support them. To this end, we build the first unified theoretical framework that rigorously derives these practices as optimal sparse posterior approximation and prior regularization from a Bayesian perspective, while simultaneously framing them as mechanisms to minimize routing ambiguity and maximize channel capacity from an information-theoretic perspective. We also pinpoint the inherent combinatorial hardness of routing, defining it as the NP-hard sparse subset selection problem. We rigorously prove the existence of a \"Coherence Barrier\"; when expert representations exhibit high mutual coherence, greedy routing strategies theoretically fail to recover the optimal expert subset. Importantly, we formally verify that imposing geometric orthogonality in the expert feature space is sufficient to narrow the divide between the NP-hard global optimum and polynomial-time greedy approximation. Our comparative analyses confirm orthogonality regularization as the optimal engineering relaxation for large-scale models.

However, relying on validation perplexity to monitor training is often insufficient, as it confounds stylistic mimicry with genuine factual internalization. To address this, we introduce the Knowledge Retention (KR) Test , a lightweight, corpus-grounded evaluation framework designed to distinguish factual learning from linguistics. KR-Test utilizes automatically generated contrastive examples to measure likelihood preferences for correct versus incorrect continuations, requiring no instruction tuning or generative decoding. We validate the framework's integrity through a \"blind vs. oracle\" baseline analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate the diagnostic capabilities of KR-Test by analyzing the training dynamics of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). By exposing the fine-grained dissociation between linguistic convergence and knowledge retention, KR-Test enhances the interpretability of fine-tuning dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\uff08KR\uff09\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u533a\u5206\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u662f\u771f\u6b63\u5185\u5316\u4e86\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fd8\u662f\u4ec5\u6a21\u4eff\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u98ce\u683c\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6837\u672c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6b63\u786e\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u5ef6\u7eed\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8bca\u65ad\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\uff08LoRA\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6536\u655b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8131\u8282\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u76d1\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u771f\u5b9e\u638c\u63e1\u4e86\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fd8\u662f\u4ec5\u6a21\u4eff\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7684KR-Test\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6b63\u786e\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u5ef6\u7eed\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u504f\u597d\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "result": "KR-Test\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u98ce\u683c\u6a21\u4eff\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5728\u76f2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u771f\u503c\u57fa\u7ebf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LoRA\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8bed\u8a00\u6536\u655b\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8131\u8282\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "KR-Test\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u77e5\u8bc6\u5185\u5316\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While recent gloss-free SLT methods have made strides in translating manual gestures, they frequently overlook the semantic criticality of facial expressions, resulting in ambiguity when distinct concepts share identical manual articulations. To address this, we present **EASLT** (**E**motion-**A**ware **S**ign **L**anguage **T**ranslation), a framework that treats facial affect not as auxiliary information, but as a robust semantic anchor. Unlike methods that relegate facial expressions to a secondary role, EASLT incorporates a dedicated emotional encoder to capture continuous affective dynamics. These representations are integrated via a novel *Emotion-Aware Fusion* (EAF) module, which adaptively recalibrates spatio-temporal sign features based on affective context to resolve semantic ambiguities. Extensive evaluations on the PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks demonstrate that EASLT establishes advanced performance among gloss-free methods, achieving BLEU-4 scores of 26.15 and 22.80, and BLEURT scores of 61.0 and 57.8, respectively.

However, this paradigm incurs substantial deployment costs as models often exhibit excessive verbosity on simple queries. Existing efficient reasoning methods relying on explicit length penalties often introduce optimization conflicts and leave the generative mechanisms driving overthinking largely unexamined. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon termed length shift where models increasingly generate unnecessary reasoning on trivial inputs during training. To address this, we introduce Dynamic Outlier Truncation (DOT), a training-time intervention that selectively suppresses redundant tokens. This method targets only the extreme tail of response lengths within fully correct rollout groups while preserving long-horizon reasoning capabilities for complex problems. To complement this intervention and ensure stable convergence, we further incorporate auxiliary KL regularization and predictive dynamic sampling. Experimental results across multiple model scales demonstrate that our approach significantly pushes the efficiency-performance Pareto frontier outward.

Here, we show that client heterogeneity destabilizes FL primarily by distorting local gradient dynamics during client-side optimization, causing systematic drift that accumulates across communication rounds and impedes global convergence. This observation highlights local gradients as a key regulatory lever for stabilizing heterogeneous FL systems. Building on this insight, we develop a general client-side perspective that regulates local gradient contributions without incurring additional communication overhead. Inspired by swarm intelligence, we instantiate this perspective through Exploratory--Convergent Gradient Re-aggregation (ECGR), which balances well-aligned and misaligned gradient components to preserve informative updates while suppressing destabilizing effects.

Existing speed-up approaches typically rely on retraining the model or designing sophisticated prompting, which are either prohibitively expensive or highly sensitive to the input and prompt formulation. In this work, we study model merging as a lightweight alternative for efficient reasoning: by combining a long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) reasoning model with a Short-CoT instruction model, we obtain an adaptive reasoner without training from scratch or requiring large-scale additional data. Building on this idea, we propose Reasoning Pattern Alignment Merging (RPAM), a layer-wise model merging framework based on feature alignment to facilitate query-adaptive reasoning. RPAM first constructs a small pattern-labeled calibration set that assigns each query an appropriate reasoning pattern. It then optimizes layer-wise merging coefficients by aligning the merged model's intermediate representations with those of the selected model, while a contrastive objective explicitly pushes them away from the non-selected model.

Existing detection methods mainly detect jailbreak status relying on jailbreak templates present in the training data. However, few studies address the more realistic and challenging zero-shot jailbreak detection setting, where no jailbreak templates are available during training. This setting better reflects real-world scenarios where new attacks continually emerge and evolve. To address this challenge, we propose a layer-wise, module-wise, and token-wise amplification framework that progressively magnifies internal feature discrepancies between benign and jailbreak prompts. We uncover safety-relevant layers, identify specific modules that inherently encode zero-shot discriminative signals, and localize informative safety tokens. Building upon these insights, we introduce ALERT (Amplification-based Jailbreak Detector), an efficient and effective zero-shot jailbreak detector that introduces two independent yet complementary classifiers on amplified representations. Extensive experiments on three safety benchmarks demonstrate that ALERT achieves consistently strong zero-shot detection performance. Specifically, (i) across all datasets and attack strategies, ALERT reliably ranks among the top two methods, and (ii) it outperforms the second-best baseline by at least 10% in average Accuracy and F1-score, and sometimes by up to 40%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u653e\u5927\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8d8a\u72f1\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6ALERT\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u5c42\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u8bcd\u5143\u7ea7\u653e\u5927\u826f\u6027\u4e0e\u8d8a\u72f1\u63d0\u793a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5c42\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u8bcd\u5143\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u4f46\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8d8a\u72f1\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u4e0d\u65ad\u6d8c\u73b0\u7684\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u677f\u5373\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b0\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c42\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u8bcd\u5143\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5f02\u653e\u5927\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u5b89\u5168\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u653e\u5927\u8868\u793a\u7684\u53cc\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "ALERT\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f4d\u5217\u524d\u4e8c\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u8d85\u8fc7\u7b2c\u4e8c\u540d\u57fa\u7ebf\u81f3\u5c1110%\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9ad8\u51fa40%\u3002", "conclusion": "ALERT\u4e3a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8d8a\u72f1\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b0\u578b\u3001\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Existing approaches rely on external classifiers, most commonly BERT based models, which suffer from limited context windows, constrained representational capacity, and additional computational overhead. We propose IntroLM, a method that enables causal language models to predict their own output quality during the prefilling phase without affecting generation using introspective tokens. By introducing token conditional LoRA that activates only for the introspective token, the model learns to predict the output quality for a given query while preserving the original backbone behavior and avoiding external evaluators. On question answering benchmarks, IntroLM applied to Qwen3 8B achieves a ROC AUC of 90 precent for success prediction, outperforming a DeBERTa classifier by 14 precent. When integrated into multi model routing systems, IntroLM achieves superior cost performance tradeoffs, reducing latency by up to 33 precent and large model usage by up to 50 precent at matched reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "IntroLM \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba9\u56e0\u679c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u586b\u5145\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u6211\u9884\u6d4b\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4ec5\u5728\u53cd\u601d\u6807\u8bb0\u65f6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u6761\u4ef6LoRA\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8f93\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u5728\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728Qwen3 8B\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523090%\u7684ROC AUC\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eDeBERTa\u5206\u7c7b\u566814\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u8def\u7531\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff08\u6700\u591a33%\uff09\u548c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\uff08\u6700\u591a50%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff08\u5982BERT\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u6709\u9650\u3001\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3001\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5185\u5728\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faIntroLM\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4ee4\u724c\u6761\u4ef6LoRA\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u586b\u5145\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u6807\u8bb0\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4e3b\u5224\u65ad\u5176\u5bf9\u7ed9\u5b9a\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cIntroLM\u5728Qwen3 8B\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8690%\u7684ROC AUC\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4DeBERTa\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u63d0\u534714\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u8def\u7531\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe33%\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c50%\u7684\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u76f8\u540c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "IntroLM\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u81ea\u6211\u9884\u6d4b\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Detecting AI-generated images has thus become a critical challenge, particularly in terms of generalizing to unseen generative models. Existing methods using frozen pre-trained CLIP models show promise in generalization but treat the image encoder as a basic feature extractor, failing to fully exploit its potential. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of the frozen CLIP image encoder (CLIP-ViT), revealing that it effectively clusters real images in a high-level, abstract feature space. However, it does not truly possess the ability to distinguish between real and AI-generated images. Based on this analysis, we propose a Masking-based Pre-trained model Fine-Tuning (MPFT) strategy, which introduces a Texture-Aware Masking (TAM) mechanism to mask textured areas containing generative model-specific patterns during fine-tuning. This approach compels CLIP-ViT to attend to the \"distributional deviations\"from authentic images for AI-generated image detection, thereby achieving enhanced generalization performance.

In this paper, we present the first comprehensive benchmarking study comparing traditional machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and large language model (LLM) approaches for mental health forecasting using the College Experience Sensing (CES) dataset, the most extensive longitudinal dataset of college student mental health to date. We systematically evaluate models across temporal windows, feature granularities, personalization strategies, and class imbalance handling. Our results show that DL models, particularly Transformer (Macro-F1 = 0.58), achieve the best overall performance, while LLMs show strength in contextual reasoning but weaker temporal modeling. Personalization substantially improves forecasts of severe mental health states. By revealing how different modeling approaches interpret phone sensing behavioral data over time, this work lays the groundwork for next-generation, adaptive, and human-centered mental health technologies that can advance both research and real-world well-being.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ML\uff09\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DL\uff09\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u624b\u673a\u4f20\u611f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u76ee\u524d\u6700\u5168\u9762\u7684\u7eb5\u5411\u5927\u5b66\u751f\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u6570\u636e\u96c6CES\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662fTransformer\uff09\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff08\u5b8fF1=0.58\uff09\uff0c\u800cLLM\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\u4f46\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u8f83\u5f31\u3002\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e25\u91cd\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u8bfb\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u672c\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u5df2\u5b58\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u800c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u7684\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ca\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53ef\u63a8\u52a8\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u652f\u6301\u4e0e\u5373\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5e72\u9884\uff08Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528College Experience Sensing\uff08CES\uff09\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u4f20\u7edfML\u3001DL\u3001LLM\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u53ca\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5904\u7406\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fTransformer\uff09\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u6700\u4f18\uff08\u5b8fF1=0.58\uff09\uff1bLLM\u867d\u5177\u5907\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u4e25\u91cd\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u667a\u80fd\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u673a\u5236\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u53d1\u5c55\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e14\u4ee5\u7528\u6237\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5e72\u9884\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

Benchmarking Spatial Intelligence from Textual Descriptions", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent advancements in Spatial Intelligence (SI) have predominantly relied on Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yet a critical question remains: does spatial understanding originate from visual encoders or the fundamental reasoning backbone? Inspired by this question, we introduce SiT-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the SI performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) without pixel-level input, comprises over 3,800 expert-annotated items across five primary categories and 17 subtasks, ranging from egocentric navigation and perspective transformation to fine-grained robotic manipulation. By converting single/multi-view scenes into high-fidelity, coordinate-aware textual descriptions, we challenge LLMs to perform symbolic textual reasoning rather than visual pattern matching. Evaluation results of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveals that while models achieve proficiency in localized semantic tasks, a significant \"spatial gap\" remains in global consistency. Notably, we find that explicit spatial reasoning significantly boosts performance, suggesting that LLMs possess latent world-modeling potential.

Available at https://openreview.net/forum?id=Rlk1bWe2ii", "summary": "Recent studies explored integrating state-space search algorithms with Language Models (LM) to perform look-ahead on the token generation process, the ''Tree-of-Thoughts'' (ToT), generated by LMs, thereby improving performance on problem-solving tasks. However, the affiliated search algorithms often overlook the significant computational costs associated with LM inference, particularly in scenarios with constrained computational budgets. Consequently, we address the problem of improving LM performance on problem-solving tasks under limited computational budgets. We demonstrate how the probabilities assigned to thoughts by LMs can serve as a heuristic to guide search within the ToT framework, thereby reducing the number of thought evaluations. Building on this insight, we adapt a heuristic search algorithm, Levin Tree Search (LTS), to the ToT framework, which leverages LMs as policies to guide the tree exploration efficiently. We extend the theoretical results of LTS by showing that, for ToT (a pruned tree), LTS guarantees a bound on the number of states expanded, and consequently, on the number of thoughts generated. Additionally, we analyze the sensitivity of this bound to the temperature values commonly used in the final softmax layer of the LM. Empirical evaluation under a fixed LM query budget demonstrates that LTS consistently achieves comparable or higher accuracy than baseline search algorithms within the ToT framework, across three domains (Blocksworld, PrOntoQA, Array Sorting) and four distinct LMs. These findings highlight the efficacy of LTS on ToT, particularly in enabling cost-effective and time-efficient problem-solving, making it well-suited for latency-critical and resource-constrained applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6982\u7387\u4f5c\u4e3a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08Levin Tree Search, LTS\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06LTS\u4e0e\u601d\u7ef4\u6811\uff08ToT\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u601d\u7ef4\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u72b6\u6001\u6269\u5c55\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLTS\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u76f8\u5f53\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5ef6\u8fdf\u654f\u611f\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u867d\u5c06\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u601d\u7ef4\uff08thoughts\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4f5c\u4e3a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86Levin Tree Search\uff08LTS\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u601d\u7ef4\u6811\uff08ToT\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u526a\u679d\u540e\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u6811\u4e2d\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u72b6\u6001\u6269\u5c55\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u6e29\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u67e5\u8be2\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0cLTS\u5728Blocksworld\u3001PrOntoQA\u3001Array Sorting\u4e09\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u57df\u53ca\u56db\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Levin Tree Search\uff08LTS\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6982\u7387\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u601d\u7ef4\u6811\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u548c\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

However, existing studies largely overlook the complex environmental factors encountered in real world scenarios-such as illumination, background, and camera viewpoint-which can substantially increase the difficulty of test images. As a result, models trained under laboratory conditions often fall short of practical deployment requirements. To bridge this gap, in this paper, an environment-robust FSS setting is introduced that explicitly incorporates challenging test cases arising from complex environments-such as motion blur, small objects, and camouflaged targets-to enhance model's robustness under realistic, dynamic conditions. An environment robust FSS benchmark (ER-FSS) is established, covering eight datasets across multiple real world scenarios. In addition, an Adaptive Attention Distillation (AAD) method is proposed, which repeatedly contrasts and distills key shared semantics between known (support) and unknown (query) images to derive class-specific attention for novel categories. This strengthens the model's ability to focus on the correct targets in complex environments, thereby improving environmental robustness. Comparative experiments show that AAD improves mIoU by 3.3% - 8.5% across all datasets and settings, demonstrating superior performance and strong generalization.

Focusing on Beethoven's piano sonatas as a case study, we empirically verify the independence of pitch and hand attributes using normalized mutual information (NMI=0.167) and propose the Smart Embedding architecture, achieving a 48.30% reduction in parameters. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs using information theory (negligible loss bounded at 0.153 bits), Rademacher complexity (28.09% tighter generalization bound), and category theory to demonstrate improved stability and generalization. Empirical results show a 9.47% reduction in validation loss, confirmed by SVD analysis and an expert listening study (N=53).

Yet existing perception-based bikeability assessment approaches face key limitations in capturing the complexity of road environments and adequately accounting for heterogeneity in subjective user perceptions. This paper proposes a persona-aware Vision-Language Model framework for bikeability assessment with three novel contributions: (i) theory-grounded persona conditioning based on established cyclist typology that generates persona-specific explanations via chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) multi-granularity supervised fine-tuning that combines scarce expert-annotated reasoning with abundant user ratings for joint prediction and explainable assessment; and (iii) AI-enabled data augmentation that creates controlled paired data to isolate infrastructure variable impacts. To test and validate this framework, we developed a panoramic image-based crowdsourcing system and collected 12,400 persona-conditioned assessments from 427 cyclists. Experiment results show that the proposed framework offers competitive bikeability rating prediction while uniquely enabling explainable factor attribution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u53cb\u597d\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u578b\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a91\u884c\u8005\u7c7b\u578b\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u3001\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u53caAI\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5168\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u4f17\u5305\u7cfb\u7edf\u6536\u96c6\u4e8612,400\u6761\u6765\u81ea427\u540d\u9a91\u884c\u8005\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u56e0\u7d20\u5f52\u56e0\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u53cb\u597d\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u9053\u8def\u73af\u5883\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u7528\u6237\u4e3b\u89c2\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u57ce\u5e02\u4ea4\u901a\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4eba\u683c\u5316\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4eba\u683c\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u8bbe\u5b9a\u3001\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08\u878d\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u8bc4\u5206\uff09\u4ee5\u53caAI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53d7\u63a7\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u9694\u79bb\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u53d8\u91cf\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u53cb\u597d\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u56e0\u7d20\u5f52\u56e0\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u53cb\u597d\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u517c\u5177\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u5177\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u9a91\u884c\u73af\u5883\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

Stone inscription images pose severe challenges for binarization due to poor contrast between etched characters and the stone background, non-uniform surface degradation, distracting artifacts, and highly variable text density and layouts. These conditions frequently cause existing binarization techniques to fail and struggle to isolate coherent character regions. Many approaches sub-divide the image into patches to improve text fragment resolution and improve binarization performance. With this in mind, we present a robust and adaptive patching strategy to binarize challenging Indic inscriptions. The patches from our approach are used to train an Attention U-Net for binarization. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on subtle structural cues, while our dynamic sampling and patch selection method ensures that the model learns to overcome surface noise and layout irregularities. We also introduce a carefully annotated, pixel-precise dataset of Indic stone inscriptions at the character-fragment level. We demonstrate that our novel patching mechanism significantly boosts binarization performance across classical and deep learning baselines. Despite training only on single script Indic dataset, our model exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to other Indic and non-indic scripts, highlighting its robustness and script-agnostic generalization capabilities. By producing clean, structured representations of inscription content, our method lays the foundation for downstream tasks such as script identification, OCR, and historical text analysis.

Recent work proposes \\emph{hop-aligned circuit hypothesis}, suggesting that bridge entities are computed sequentially across layers before later-hop answers. Through systematic analyses on real-world multi-hop queries, we show that this hop-aligned assumption does not generalize: later-hop answer entities can become decodable earlier than bridge entities, a phenomenon we call \\emph{layer-order inversion}, which strengthens with total hops. To explain this behavior, we propose a \\emph{probabilistic recall-and-extract} framework that models multi-hop reasoning as broad probabilistic recall in shallow MLP layers followed by selective extraction in deeper attention layers. This framework is empirically validated through systematic probing analyses, reinterpreting prior layer-wise decoding evidence, explaining chain-of-thought gains, and providing a mechanistic diagnosis of multi-hop failures despite correct single-hop knowledge.

Key difficulties include modeling complex multi-scale evolution, correcting inter-frame feature misalignment caused by displacement, and efficiently capturing long-range spatiotemporal context without sacrificing spatial fidelity. To address these issues, we present the Multi-scale Feature Communication Rectified Flow (RF) Network (MFC-RFNet), a generative framework that integrates multi-scale communication with guided feature fusion. To enhance multi-scale fusion while retaining fine detail, a Wavelet-Guided Skip Connection (WGSC) preserves high-frequency components, and a Feature Communication Module (FCM) promotes bidirectional cross-scale interaction. To correct inter-frame displacement, a Condition-Guided Spatial Transform Fusion (CGSTF) learns spatial transforms from conditioning echoes to align shallow features. The backbone adopts rectified flow training to learn near-linear probability-flow trajectories, enabling few-step sampling with stable fidelity. Additionally, lightweight Vision-RWKV (RWKV) blocks are placed at the encoder tail, the bottleneck, and the first decoder layer to capture long-range spatiotemporal dependencies at low spatial resolutions with moderate compute. Evaluations on four public datasets (SEVIR, MeteoNet, Shanghai, and CIKM) demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines, yielding clearer echo morphology at higher rain-rate thresholds and sustained skill at longer lead times.

Existing evaluations often measure privacy-related attitudes or sharing intentions in isolation, which makes it difficult to determine whether a model's expressed values jointly predict its downstream data-sharing actions as in real human behaviors. We introduce a context-based assessment protocol that sequentially administers standardized questionnaires for privacy attitudes, prosocialness, and acceptance of data sharing within a bounded, history-carrying session. To evaluate value-action alignments under competing attitudes, we use multi-group structural equation modeling (MGSEM) to identify relations from privacy concerns and prosocialness to data sharing. We propose Value-Action Alignment Rate (VAAR), a human-referenced directional agreement metric that aggregates path-level evidence for expected signs. Across multiple LLMs, we observe stable but model-specific Privacy-PSA-AoDS profiles, and substantial heterogeneity in value-action alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u4f1a\u8bdd\u4e2d\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6d4b\u91cf\u9690\u79c1\u6001\u5ea6\u3001\u5229\u4ed6\u6027\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u7ec4\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\uff08MGSEM\uff09\u5206\u6790\u9690\u79c1\u62c5\u5fe7\u4e0e\u5229\u4ed6\u6027\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u7167\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6307\u6807VAAR\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ef7\u503c\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4f46\u5404\u5177\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u9690\u79c1-\u5229\u4ed6-\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\uff08Privacy-PSA-AoDS\uff09\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u4ef7\u503c-\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b64\u7acb\u5730\u6d4b\u91cf\u9690\u79c1\u6001\u5ea6\u6216\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u591a\u91cd\u52a8\u673a\u5171\u5b58\u4e0b\u7684\u4ef7\u503c-\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u52a8\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u95ee\u5377\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5728\u5386\u53f2\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u4f1a\u8bdd\u4e2d\u4f9d\u6b21\u6536\u96c6\u9690\u79c1\u6001\u5ea6\u3001\u5229\u4ed6\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u7ec4\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\uff08MGSEM\uff09\u5206\u6790\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u8def\u5f84\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u7167\u7684\u503c-\u884c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7387\uff08VAAR\uff09\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8def\u5f84\u65b9\u5411\u8bc1\u636e\u91cf\u5316\u9884\u671f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f02\u7684\u9690\u79c1-\u5229\u4ed6-\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\uff08Privacy-PSA-AoDS\uff09\u7279\u5f81\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u5728\u4ef7\u503c\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u8868\u8fbe\u7279\u5b9a\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u5229\u4ed6\u52a8\u673a\u4e0b\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u7167\u6807\u51c6\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002"}}

This paper presents CrackSegFlow, a controllable flow-matching synthesis framework that generates photorealistic crack images conditioned on binary masks while preserving strict mask-image alignment. The generator combines topology-preserving mask injection with boundary-gated modulation to maintain thin-structure continuity and suppress texture-driven false positives. A second class-conditional flow-matching model synthesizes crack masks with explicit control over crack coverage, enabling balanced, topology-diverse paired data without additional manual annotation. We further inject crack masks into crack-free backgrounds to diversify illumination and surface artifacts and reduce false positives caused by shadows, joints, and pavement markings. Experiments on five benchmarks spanning four asphalt datasets and the crack class of a concrete-domain dataset demonstrate consistent improvements under an established hybrid CNN--Transformer segmentation backbone and a fixed training protocol. With real plus synthesized pairs, in-domain performance improves on average by 5.37 mIoU and 5.13 F1, and target-guided cross-domain synthesis yields average gains of 13.12 mIoU and 14.82 F1 using only limited target mask statistics. Compared with diffusion-based semantic synthesis, CrackSegFlow provides substantially faster deterministic sampling and improves fidelity and mask-image alignment for thin-structure crack geometry.

A topic of continued interest in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence is whether some neurons behave like grandmother cells, i.e., neurons that are inherently interpretable because they exclusively respond to single concepts. In this work, we propose two information-theoretic measures that quantify the neuronal saliency and selectivity for single concepts. We apply these metrics to the representations of TabPFN, a tabular foundation model, and perform a simple search across neuron-concept pairs to find the most salient and selective pair. Our analysis provides the first evidence that some neurons in such models show moderate, statistically significant saliency and selectivity for high-level concepts. These findings suggest that interpretable neurons can emerge naturally and that they can, in some cases, be identified without resorting to more complex interpretability techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eTabPFN\u8fd9\u4e00\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u90e8\u5206\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e2d\u7b49\u4f46\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u53ef\u80fd\u81ea\u7136\u6d8c\u73b0\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u89e3\u91ca\u6280\u672f\u5373\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u7c7b\u4f3c'\u7956\u6bcd\u7ec6\u80de'\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u5373\u4ec5\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u6982\u5ff5\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u8861\u91cf\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\uff1b\u5728TabPFN\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u795e\u7ecf\u5143-\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u7684\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u663e\u8457\u548c\u6700\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u90e8\u5206\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u6982\u5ff5\u5177\u6709\u4e2d\u7b49\u4f46\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u81ea\u7136\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u81ea\u7136\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

While LLM's responses may not always be legally incorrect, their unverified use still can lead to severe issues such as unlawful arrests and improper evidence collection. To address this, we propose PAS (Police Action Scenarios), a systematic framework covering the entire evaluation process. Applying this framework, we constructed a novel QA dataset from over 8,000 official documents and established key metrics validated through statistical analysis with police expert judgements.

Existing models can produce high-quality short clips but often fail to preserve entity identity and appearance when scenes change or when entities reappear after long temporal gaps. We present VideoMemory, an entity-centric framework that integrates narrative planning with visual generation through a Dynamic Memory Bank. Given a structured script, a multi-agent system decomposes the narrative into shots, retrieves entity representations from memory, and synthesizes keyframes and videos conditioned on these retrieved states. The Dynamic Memory Bank stores explicit visual and semantic descriptors for characters, props, and backgrounds, and is updated after each shot to reflect story-driven changes while preserving identity. This retrieval-update mechanism enables consistent portrayal of entities across distant shots and supports coherent long-form generation. To evaluate this setting, we construct a 54-case multi-shot consistency benchmark covering character-, prop-, and background-persistent scenarios. Extensive experiments show that VideoMemory achieves strong entity-level coherence and high perceptual quality across diverse narrative sequences.", "AI": {"tldr": "VideoMemory \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee5\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\u5c06\u53d9\u4e8b\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u955c\u5934\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u89d2\u8272\u3001\u9053\u5177\u548c\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u89e3\u5267\u672c\uff0c\u4ece\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u5b9e\u4f53\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u955c\u5934\u540e\u66f4\u65b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u4f53\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u955c\u5934\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u77ed\u7247\u6bb5\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u573a\u666f\u5207\u6362\u6216\u5b9e\u4f53\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9694\u91cd\u73b0\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u89d2\u8272\u3001\u9053\u5177\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u957f\u7bc7\u53d9\u4e8b\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa VideoMemory \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u52a8\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u89d2\u8272\u3001\u9053\u5177\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u63cf\u8ff0\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u6790\u5267\u672c\u5e76\u5206\u62c6\u4e3a\u955c\u5934\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\u68c0\u7d22\u5b9e\u4f53\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\uff1b\u6bcf\u6b21\u751f\u6210\u540e\u66f4\u65b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\u4ee5\u53cd\u6620\u6545\u4e8b\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u5efa\u768454\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u591a\u955c\u5934\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cVideoMemory \u5728\u89d2\u8272\u3001\u9053\u5177\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u9ad8\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "VideoMemory \u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u53d9\u4e8b\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u671f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u957f\u7bc7\u89c6\u9891\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Extensive experiments on MGPC-1M and in-the-wild data demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms prior baselines and exhibits strong generalization under real-world conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMGPC\u7684\u901a\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u70b9\u4e91\u8865\u5168\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u70b9\u4e91\u3001RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u4e22\u5f03\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u8d85\u8fc71000\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u4e00\u767e\u4e07\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6MGPC-1M\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u8865\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u65b0\u7269\u4f53\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u65f6\uff0c\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u8f83\u5dee\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u8865\u5168\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMGPC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u70b9\u4e91\u3001RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u6001\u4e22\u5f03\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u51e0\u4f55\u5efa\u6a21\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6MGPC-1M\u3002", "result": "\u5728MGPC-1M\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u70b9\u4e91\u8865\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "MGPC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u70b9\u4e91\u8865\u5168\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u70b9\u4e91\u8865\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, GRPO faces structural limitations in reasoning-heavy settings: sequence-level advantage normalization introduces systematic length bias, penalties for low-quality trajectories are diluted, and the scalar objective discards rich pairwise preference information embedded in within-group reward rankings. As a result, valuable supervision from costly rollouts remains underutilized.\n  We propose AMIR-GRPO, which augments GRPO with an implicit DPO-style contrastive regularizer constructed directly from intra-group reward rankings, requiring no additional annotations. This mechanism amplifies suppression of low-reward trajectories, attenuates response-level length bias, and transforms each rollout group into a denser set of supervision constraints. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, AMIR-GRPO consistently outperforms strong GRPO baselines, yields clearer separation between correct and incorrect reasoning chains, and delivers broader coverage gains beyond the subset of instances solved by standard GRPO.", "AI": {"tldr": "AMIR-GRPO\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86GRPO\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec4\u5185\u5956\u52b1\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6807\u6ce8\u5373\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6291\u5236\u3001\u51cf\u8f7b\u957f\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "GRPO\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u4f18\u52bf\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u957f\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u8f68\u8ff9\u60e9\u7f5a\u88ab\u7a00\u91ca\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u6807\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u4e22\u5931\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\u4fe1\u606f\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6602\u8d35\u91c7\u6837\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAMIR-GRPO\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528\u7ec4\u5185\u5956\u52b1\u6392\u5e8f\u6784\u5efa\u7c7b\u4f3cDPO\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u4f4e\u5956\u52b1\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u54cd\u5e94\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u6bcf\u4e2a\u91c7\u6837\u7ec4\u5305\u542b\u66f4\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cAMIR-GRPO\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebfGRPO\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6b63\u786e\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6807\u51c6GRPO\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u6837\u672c\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "AMIR-GRPO\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86GRPO\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5185\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u6392\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, how large language models (LLMs) acquire, retain, and forget such concepts during continual pretraining remains poorly understood. In this work, we study how individual concepts are acquired and forgotten, as well as how multiple concepts interact through interference and synergy. We link these behavioral dynamics to LLMs' internal Concept Circuits, computational subgraphs associated with specific concepts, and incorporate Graph Metrics to characterize circuit structure. Our analysis reveals: (1) LLMs concept circuits provide a non-trivial, statistically significant signal of concept learning and forgetting; (2) Concept circuits exhibit a stage-wise temporal pattern during continual pretraining, with an early increase followed by gradual decrease and stabilization; (3) concepts with larger learning gains tend to exhibit greater forgetting under subsequent training; (4) semantically similar concepts induce stronger interference than weakly related ones; (5) conceptual knowledge differs in their transferability, with some significantly facilitating the learning of others. Together, our findings offer a circuit-level view of concept learning dynamics and inform the design of more interpretable and robust concept-aware training strategies for LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u4e60\u5f97\u3001\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u9057\u5fd8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u2018\u6982\u5ff5\u7535\u8def\u2019\uff08Concept Circuits\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u6982\u5ff5\u7535\u8def\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u53cd\u6620\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u9057\u5fd8\uff1b2\uff09\u6982\u5ff5\u7535\u8def\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u5448\u73b0\u5148\u4e0a\u5347\u540e\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b3\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\u6536\u76ca\u5927\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u66f4\u6613\u53d1\u751f\u9057\u5fd8\uff1b4\uff09\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u66f4\u5f3a\uff1b5\uff09\u90e8\u5206\u6982\u5ff5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5176\u4ed6\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u83b7\u53d6\u3001\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u9057\u5fd8\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6982\u5ff5\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u5c1a\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4ece\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u5c42\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u7535\u8def\uff08\u5373\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u6982\u5ff5\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b50\u56fe\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u8bba\u6307\u6807\u5206\u6790\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u5bdf\u6982\u5ff5\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u9057\u5fd8\u53ca\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6982\u5ff5\u7535\u8def\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8868\u5f81\u6982\u5ff5\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u9057\u5fd8\uff1b\u6982\u5ff5\u7535\u8def\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u5448\u73b0\u9636\u6bb5\u5f0f\u6f14\u53d8\uff1b\u9ad8\u5b66\u4e60\u6536\u76ca\u6982\u5ff5\u66f4\u6613\u9057\u5fd8\uff1b\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6982\u5ff5\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u66f4\u5f3a\u5e72\u6270\uff1b\u90e8\u5206\u6982\u5ff5\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7535\u8def\u7ea7\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u611f\u77e5\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

We observe that local anomalies, though indistinguishable under global analysis, become conspicuous when the data space is decomposed into restricted regions and each region is examined independently. Leveraging this geometric insight, we propose SVEAD (Stochastic Voronoi Ensembles Anomaly Detector), which constructs ensemble random Voronoi diagrams and scores points by normalized cell-relative distances weighted by local scale.

Current evaluative approaches primarily rely on refusal-based safety signals, which offer limited insight into the nuanced behaviors required in clinical practice. In mental health, clinically inadequate refusals can be perceived as unempathetic and discourage help-seeking. To address this gap, we move beyond refusal-centric metrics and introduce \\texttt{PsychEthicsBench}, the first principle-grounded benchmark based on Australian psychology and psychiatry guidelines, designed to evaluate LLMs' ethical knowledge and behavioral responses through multiple-choice and open-ended tasks with fine-grained ethicality annotations. Empirical results across 14 models reveal that refusal rates are poor indicators of ethical behavior, revealing a significant divergence between safety triggers and clinical appropriateness. Notably, we find that domain-specific fine-tuning can degrade ethical robustness, as several specialized models underperform their base backbones in ethical alignment.

While most existing methods rely on RGB appearance, human pose estimation, or their combination, our work demonstrates that tracking randomly sampled image points across video frames can substantially improve recognition accuracy. Unlike prior approaches, we do not detect hands, objects, or interaction regions. Instead, we employ CoTracker to follow a set of randomly initialized points through each video and use the resulting trajectories, together with the corresponding image frames, as input to a Transformer-based recognition model. Surprisingly, our method achieves notable gains even when only the initial frame and its associated point tracks are provided, without incorporating the full video sequence. Experimental results confirm that integrating 2D point tracks consistently enhances performance compared to the same model trained without motion information, highlighting their potential as a lightweight yet effective representation for egocentric action understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e2D\u70b9\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u81ea\u6307\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u56fe\u50cf\u70b9\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u95f4\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u989d\u5916\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u90e8\u3001\u7269\u4f53\u6216\u4ea4\u4e92\u533a\u57df\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u901a\u8fc7CoTracker\u8ffd\u8e2a\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u5e27\u8f93\u5165Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u521d\u59cb\u5e27\u548c\u5bf9\u5e94\u70b9\u8f68\u8ff9\u5373\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e2D\u70b9\u8f68\u8ff9\u662f\u8f7b\u91cf\u4f46\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u6307\u52a8\u4f5c\u7406\u89e3\u8868\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u6307\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56RGB\u5916\u89c2\u3001\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6216\u5176\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u5ffd\u7565\u7ec6\u5fae\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u68c0\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6027\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528CoTracker\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u76842D\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u5e27\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u70b9\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5e27\u8054\u5408\u8f93\u5165Transformer-based\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f15\u51652D\u70b9\u8f68\u8ff9\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u521d\u59cb\u5e27\u548c\u70b9\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e5f\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "2D\u70b9\u8f68\u8ff9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u81ea\u6307\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u52a8\u4f5c\u7406\u89e3\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

When a user code-switches in their prompt to an LLM, they typically do not specify the expected language of the LLM response, and thus LLMs must infer the output language from contextual and pragmatic cues. We find that current LLMs systematically fail to align with this expectation, responding in undesired languages even when cues are clear to humans. We introduce OLA, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' Output Language Alignment in code-switched interactions. OLA focuses on Korean--English code-switching and spans simple intra-sentential mixing to instruction-content mismatches. Even frontier models frequently misinterpret implicit language expectation, exhibiting a bias toward non-English responses. We further show this bias generalizes beyond Korean to Chinese and Indonesian pairs. Models also show instability through mid-response switching and language intrusions. Chain-of-Thought prompting fails to resolve these errors, indicating weak pragmatic reasoning about output language. However, Code-Switching Aware DPO with minimal data (about 1K examples) substantially reduces misalignment, suggesting these failures stem from insufficient alignment rather than fundamental limitations. Our results highlight the need to align multilingual LLMs with users' implicit expectations in real-world code-switched interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faOLA\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u5207\u6362\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7528\u6237\u672a\u660e\u786e\u6307\u5b9a\u54cd\u5e94\u8bed\u8a00\u65f6\uff0c\u5e38\u9519\u8bef\u5730\u4ee5\u975e\u9884\u671f\u8bed\u8a00\u56de\u5e94\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u504f\u5411\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4e14\u6b64\u504f\u5dee\u5728\u97e9\u82f1\u3001\u4e2d\u82f1\u3001\u5370\u5c3c\u82f1\u7b49\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u8fd8\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u54cd\u5e94\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u6df7\u4e71\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u8bed\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8584\u5f31\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff08\u7ea61000\u4e2a\u793a\u4f8b\uff09\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5207\u6362\u611f\u77e5DPO\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u95ee\u9898\u6839\u6e90\u5728\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u800c\u975e\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u8eab\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7528\u6237\u8fdb\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u5207\u6362\u65f6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u63a8\u65ad\u5e76\u54cd\u5e94\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f93\u51fa\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u9690\u542b\u671f\u671b\u4e0d\u7b26\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u7528\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaOLA\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4ece\u53e5\u5185\u6df7\u5408\u5230\u6307\u4ee4-\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u4ee3\u7801\u5207\u6362\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u97e9\u82f1\u3001\u4e2d\u82f1\u3001\u5370\u5c3c\u82f1\u7b49\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u4e2d\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\u5207\u6362\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08DPO\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u5207\u6362\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u9891\u7e41\u51fa\u73b0\u8f93\u51fa\u8bed\u8a00\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u504f\u597d\uff1b\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u73b0\u8c61\u666e\u904d\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e2d\u9014\u5207\u6362\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6df7\u5165\uff1b\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u65e0\u6548\uff1b\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea61000\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5207\u6362\u611f\u77e5DPO\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u5224\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u5207\u6362\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u7528\u6237\u9690\u542b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u671f\u671b\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u5373\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u91cd\u89c6\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u7528\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u3002"}}

However, applying VLMs to 6-DoF endoscopic camera localization presents several challenges: 1) the lack of large-scale, high-quality, densely annotated, and localization-oriented vision-language datasets in real-world medical settings; 2) limited capability for fine-grained pose regression; and 3) high computational latency when extracting temporal features from past frames. To address these issues, we first construct BREATH dataset, the largest in-vivo endoscopic localization dataset to date, collected in the complex human airway. Building on this dataset, we propose BREATH-VL, a hybrid framework that integrates semantic cues from VLMs with geometric information from vision-based registration methods for accurate 6-DoF pose estimation. Our motivation lies in the complementary strengths of both approaches: VLMs offer generalizable semantic understanding, while registration methods provide precise geometric alignment. To further enhance the VLM's ability to capture temporal context, we introduce a lightweight context-learning mechanism that encodes motion history as linguistic prompts, enabling efficient temporal reasoning without expensive video-level computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the vision-language module delivers robust semantic localization in challenging surgical scenes. Building on this, our BREATH-VL outperforms state-of-the-art vision-only localization methods in both accuracy and generalization, reducing translational error by 25.5% compared with the best-performing baseline, while achieving competitive computational latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faBREATH-VL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u914d\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5185\u7aa5\u955c6-DoF\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u56de\u5f52\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u76ee\u524d\u6700\u5927\u7684\u5728\u4f53\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6570\u636e\u96c6BREATH\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u7f16\u7801\u8fd0\u52a8\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e25.5%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5185\u7aa5\u955c6-DoF\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u59ff\u6001\u56de\u5f52\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u53ca\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaBREATH\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u63d0\u51faBREATH-VL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408VLM\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u914d\u51c6\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd0\u52a8\u5386\u53f2\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "BREATH-VL\u5728\u590d\u6742\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u8bed\u4e49\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u51cf\u5c1125.5%\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u673a\u5236\uff0cBREATH-VL\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5185\u7aa5\u955c6-DoF\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u5bfc\u822a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Conventional RNN-based predictors adopt an encoder-only strategy with sliding historical windows as inputs to forecast future values. However, this approach treats all time steps and hidden states equally without considering their distinct contributions to forecasting, leading to suboptimal performance.

In contrast, real-world reasoning requires integrating multiple premises and solving subproblems in parallel. Existing methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), express reasoning in a linear textual form, which may appear coherent but frequently leads to inconsistent conclusions. Recent approaches rely on externally provided graphs and do not explore how LLMs can construct and use their own graph-structured reasoning, particularly in open-domain QA. To fill this gap, we novelly explore graph-structured reasoning of LLMs in general-domain question answering. We propose Self-Graph Reasoning (SGR), a framework that enables LLMs to explicitly represent their reasoning process as a structured graph before producing the final answer.

Compared with labor-intensive per-model on-device calibration, a digital-twin pipeline built on optical simulation offers a substantial advantage in generating large-scale labeled data. However, complex imaging conditions induce a domain gap between simulation and real-world images, limiting the generalization of simulation-trained models. To address this, we propose augmenting a simulation baseline with minimal unlabeled real-world images captured at random misalignment positions, mitigating the gap from a domain adaptation perspective. We introduce Domain Adaptive Active Alignment (DA3), which utilizes an autoregressive domain transformation generator and an adversarial-based feature alignment strategy to distill real-world domain information via self-supervised learning. This enables the extraction of domain-invariant image degradation features to facilitate robust misalignment prediction. Experiments on two lens types reveal that DA3 improves accuracy by 46% over a purely simulation pipeline. Notably, it approaches the performance achieved with precisely labeled real-world data collected on 3 lens samples, while reducing on-device data collection time by 98.7%. The results demonstrate that domain adaptation effectively endows simulation-trained models with robust real-world performance, validating the digital-twin pipeline as a practical solution to significantly enhance the efficiency of large-scale optical assembly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5bf9\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5DA3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5c11\u91cf\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u53d6\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u9000\u5316\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4eff\u771f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDA3\u76f8\u6bd4\u7eaf\u4eff\u771f\u7ba1\u9053\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u534746%\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u4f7f\u7528\u7cbe\u786e\u6807\u6ce8\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u73b0\u573a\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1198.7%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4eff\u771f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5bf9\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6210\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u5927\u91cf\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDA3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u57df\u53d8\u6362\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6297\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u968f\u673a\u9519\u4f4d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u70bc\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u955c\u5934\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cDA3\u4f7f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u76f8\u6bd4\u7eaf\u4eff\u771f\u7ba1\u9053\u63d0\u534746%\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u4f7f\u75283\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u573a\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1198.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4eff\u771f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5149\u5b66\u88c5\u914d\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

However, general-purpose, reaction-wise descriptors remain scarce. This study introduces RXNEmb, a novel reaction-level descriptor derived from RXNGraphormer, a model pre-trained to distinguish real reactions from fictitious ones with erroneous bond changes, thereby learning intrinsic bond formation and cleavage patterns. We demonstrate its utility by data-driven re-clustering of the USPTO-50k dataset, yielding a classification that more directly reflects bond-change similarities than rule-based categories.

However, the privacy risks associated with these models remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate information leakage in such models through three types of black-box inference attacks. First, we design a graph reconstruction attack, which can reconstruct graphs structurally similar to those training graphs from the generated graphs. Second, we propose a property inference attack to infer the properties of the training graphs, such as the average graph density and the distribution of densities, from the generated graphs. Third, we develop two membership inference attacks to determine whether a given graph is present in the training set. Extensive experiments on three different types of graph generative diffusion models and six real-world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks, significantly outperforming the baseline approaches. Finally, we propose two defense mechanisms that mitigate these inference attacks and achieve a better trade-off between defense strength and target model utility than existing methods.

This necessitates a new class of model robustness analysis: robustness of the predictive reasoning under adversarial attacks, which goes beyond existing paradigm that mainly focuses on the shifts of the final predictions (e.g., fake v.s. real). To analyze such reasoning shifts, we introduce a forensic auditing framework to evaluate the robustness of ALMs' reasoning under adversarial attacks in three inter-connected dimensions: acoustic perception, cognitive coherence, and cognitive dissonance. Our systematic analysis reveals that explicit reasoning does not universally enhance robustness. Instead, we observe a bifurcation: for models exhibiting robust acoustic perception, reasoning acts as a defensive \\textit{``shield''}, protecting them from adversarial attacks.

However, existing methods often overlook contextual interactions from the surrounding environment and insufficiently incorporate the hierarchical structure of marine biological taxonomy. To address these challenges, we propose MATANet (Multi-context Attention and Taxonomy-Aware Network), a novel model designed for fine-grained marine species classification. MATANet mimics expert strategies by using taxonomy and environmental context to interpret ambiguous features of underwater animals. It consists of two key components: a Multi-Context Environmental Attention Module (MCEAM), which learns relationships between regions of interest (ROIs) and their surrounding environments, and a Hierarchical Separation-Induced Learning Module (HSLM), which encodes taxonomic hierarchy into the feature space. MATANet combines instance and environmental features with taxonomic structure to enhance fine-grained classification.

We introduce TreeAdv (Tree-Structured Advantage Redistribution for Group-Based RL), which makes the tree structure of group rollouts explicit for both exploration and advantage assignment. Specifically, TreeAdv builds a group of trees (a forest) based on an entropy-driven sampling method where each tree branches at high-uncertainty decisions while sharing low-uncertainty tokens across rollouts. Then, TreeAdv aggregates token-level advantages for internal tree segments by redistributing the advantages of complete rollouts (all leaf nodes), and TreeAdv can easily apply to group-based objectives such as GRPO or GSPO.

While hyperspectral image offers a powerful alternative by capturing fine-grained spectral signatures, progress in hyperspectral camouflaged object detection (HCOD) has been critically hampered by the absence of a dedicated, large-scale benchmark. To spur innovation, we introduce HyperCOD, the first challenging benchmark for HCOD. Comprising 350 high-resolution hyperspectral images, It features complex real-world scenarios with minimal objects, intricate shapes, severe occlusions, and dynamic lighting to challenge current models. The advent of foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) presents a compelling opportunity. To adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for HCOD, we propose HyperSpectral Camouflage-aware SAM (HSC-SAM). HSC-SAM ingeniously reformulates the hyperspectral image by decoupling it into a spatial map fed to SAM's image encoder and a spectral saliency map that serves as an adaptive prompt. This translation effectively bridges the modality gap. Extensive experiments show that HSC-SAM sets a new state-of-the-art on HyperCOD and generalizes robustly to other public HSI datasets.

In this note, we elucidate the geometric interpretation of the algorithm within the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS).

Despite its success in simple scenarios, this paradigm still significantly struggles with compositional editing tasks that require precise local control and complex multi-object spatial reasoning. This paradigm is severely limited by 1) the implicit coupling of planning and execution, 2) the lack of object-level control granularity, and 3) the reliance on unstructured, pixel-centric modeling. To address these limitations, we propose I2E, a novel \"Decompose-then-Action\" paradigm that revisits image editing as an actionable interaction process within a structured environment. I2E utilizes a Decomposer to transform unstructured images into discrete, manipulable object layers and then introduces a physics-aware Vision-Language-Action Agent to parse complex instructions into a series of atomic actions via Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Further, we also construct I2E-Bench, a benchmark designed for multi-instance spatial reasoning and high-precision editing. Experimental results on I2E-Bench and multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that I2E significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in handling complex compositional instructions, maintaining physical plausibility, and ensuring multi-turn editing stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aI2E\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528'\u5206\u89e3-\u6267\u884c'\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u89c6\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u5668\u5c06\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u5c42\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u89e3\u6790\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u539f\u5b50\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u4e86I2E-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cI2E\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7ec4\u5408\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u53ca\u591a\u8f6e\u7f16\u8f91\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4fee\u590d\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u5c40\u90e8\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u590d\u6742\u591a\u5bf9\u8c61\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u8026\u5408\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ea7\u63a7\u5236\u7c92\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u65e0\u7ed3\u6784\u50cf\u7d20\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faI2E\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09\u5206\u89e3\u5668\uff08Decomposer\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u5c42\uff1b2\uff09\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u539f\u5b50\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002\u6574\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u9075\u5faa\u2018\u5206\u89e3-\u6267\u884c\u2019\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728I2E-Bench\u53ca\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cI2E\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7ec4\u5408\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u8f6e\u7f16\u8f91\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "I2E\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u2018\u5206\u89e3-\u6267\u884c\u2019\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While text-based affect inference has become increasingly feasible, prior approaches often treat sentiment as a deterministic point estimate for individual speakers, failing to capture the inherent subjectivity, latent ambiguity, and sequential coupling found in mutual exchanges. We introduce LLM-MC-Affect, a probabilistic framework that characterizes emotion not as a static label, but as a continuous latent probability distribution defined over an affective space. By leveraging stochastic LLM decoding and Monte Carlo estimation, the methodology approximates these distributions to derive high-fidelity sentiment trajectories that explicitly quantify both central affective tendencies and perceptual ambiguity. These trajectories enable a structured analysis of interpersonal coupling through sequential cross-correlation and slope-based indicators, identifying leading or lagging influences between interlocutors. To validate the interpretive capacity of this approach, we utilize teacher-student instructional dialogues as a representative case study, where our quantitative indicators successfully distill high-level interaction insights such as effective scaffolding.

However, while these approaches effectively enhance perception abilities, they primarily target holistic content understanding, often lacking explicit supervision for intrinsic temporal coherence and inter-frame correlations. This tendency limits the models' ability to capture intricate dynamics and fine-grained visual causality. To explicitly bridge this gap, we propose a novel post-training objective: Masked Video Prediction (MVP). By requiring the model to reconstruct a masked continuous segment from a set of challenging distractors, MVP forces the model to attend to the sequential logic and temporal context of events. To support scalable training, we introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline capable of transforming arbitrary video corpora into MVP training samples, and further employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a fine-grained reward function to enhance the model's understanding of video context and temporal properties. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that MVP enhances video reasoning capabilities by directly reinforcing temporal reasoning and causal understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u2014\u2014\u63a9\u7801\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\uff08MVP\uff09\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u5e27\u95f4\u5173\u8054\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8981\u6c42\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u4e00\u7ec4\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u88ab\u906e\u853d\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u89c6\u9891\u7247\u6bb5\uff0cMVP \u5f3a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08GRPO\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMVP \u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u5728\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6574\u4f53\u5185\u5bb9\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u5e27\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u89c6\u89c9\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u63a9\u7801\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\uff08MVP\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u751f\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08GRPO\uff09\u4e0e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "result": "MVP \u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u7406\u89e3\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4fc3\u8fdb\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u63a9\u7801\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\uff08MVP\uff09\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u5e27\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u5411\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Currently, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) stands as the dominant algorithm in this domain due to its stable training and critic-free efficiency. However, we argue that GRPO suffers from a structural limitation: it imposes a uniform, static trust region constraint across all samples. This design implicitly assumes signal homogeneity, a premise misaligned with the heterogeneous nature of outcome-driven learning, where advantage magnitudes and variances fluctuate significantly. Consequently, static constraints fail to fully exploit high-quality signals while insufficiently suppressing noise, often precipitating rapid entropy collapse. To address this, we propose \\textbf{E}lastic \\textbf{T}rust \\textbf{R}egions (\\textbf{ETR}), a dynamic mechanism that aligns optimization constraints with signal quality. ETR constructs a signal-aware landscape through dual-level elasticity: at the micro level, it scales clipping boundaries based on advantage magnitude to accelerate learning from high-confidence paths; at the macro level, it leverages group variance to implicitly allocate larger update budgets to tasks in the optimal learning zone. Extensive experiments on AIME and MATH benchmarks demonstrate that ETR consistently outperforms GRPO, achieving superior accuracy while effectively mitigating policy entropy degradation to ensure sustained exploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57dfETR\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3GRPO\u9759\u6001\u7ea6\u675f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u4e0e\u71b5\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728AIME\u548cMATH\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eGRPO\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u7ef4\u6301\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "GRPO\u867d\u7a33\u5b9a\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9759\u6001\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57df\u5047\u8bbe\u4fe1\u53f7\u540c\u8d28\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u5956\u52b1\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4f18\u52bf\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0e\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u4ef7\u503c\u4fe1\u53f7\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u6316\u6398\uff0c\u566a\u58f0\u6291\u5236\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u71b5\u5feb\u901f\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "ETR\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5c42\u5f39\u6027\u673a\u5236\u6784\u5efa\u4fe1\u53f7\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1a\u5fae\u89c2\u5c42\u9762\u6839\u636e\u4f18\u52bf\u5e45\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u7f29\u653e\u88c1\u526a\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u8def\u5f84\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u5b8f\u89c2\u5c42\u9762\u5229\u7528\u7ec4\u5185\u65b9\u5dee\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u914d\u66f4\u5927\u66f4\u65b0\u9884\u7b97\u7ed9\u5904\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u5b66\u4e60\u533a\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728AIME\u548cMATH\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cETR\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eGRPO\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u71b5\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u4fdd\u969c\u6301\u7eed\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ETR\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u9002\u914d\u5f02\u8d28\u4fe1\u53f7\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

This significantly reduces not only the number of trainable parameters but also the total parameters computed during the forward pass, minimizing GPU memory consumption and accelerating the training process. (2) Layer Alignment, where the newly trained layers are reintegrated into the original model, followed by a brief full fine-tuning step on a small dataset to align the parameters.

Training these AI models requires a large amount of training data that is costly to acquire and annotate, especially in high-variance, low-volume manufacturing environments. A popular approach to reduce the need for real data is the use of synthetic data that is generated by leveraging computer-aided design (CAD) models available in the industry. However, in the agricultural industry these models are not readily available, increasing the difficulty in leveraging synthetic data. In this paper, we present different techniques for substituting CAD files to create synthetic datasets.

A common strategy in LLM fine-tuning is curriculum learning, which pre-orders training samples based on metrics like difficulty to improve learning efficiency compared to a random sampling strategy. However, most existing methods for LLM fine-tuning rely on a static curriculum, designed prior to training, which lacks adaptability to the model's evolving needs during fine-tuning. To address this, we propose EDCO, a novel framework based on two key concepts: inference entropy and dynamic curriculum orchestration. Inspired by recent findings that maintaining high answer entropy benefits long-term reasoning gains, EDCO prioritizes samples with high inference entropy in a continuously adapted curriculum. EDCO integrates three core components: an efficient entropy estimator that uses prefix tokens to approximate full-sequence entropy, an entropy-based curriculum generator that selects data points with the highest inference entropy, and an LLM trainer that optimizes the model on the selected curriculum. Comprehensive experiments in communication, medicine and law domains, EDCO outperforms traditional curriculum strategies for fine-tuning Qwen3-4B and Llama3.2-3B models under supervised and reinforcement learning settings. Furthermore, the proposed efficient entropy estimation reduces computational time by 83.5% while maintaining high accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "EDCO \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u71b5\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7f16\u6392\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u6301\u7eed\u8c03\u6574\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u9009\u62e9\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u71b5\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\uff08\u51cf\u5c1183.5%\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u8bfe\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u9759\u6001\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u5177\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "EDCO\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u524d\u7f00\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u71b5\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6301\u7eed\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u71b5\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u5bf9Qwen3-4B\u548cLlama3.2-3B\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cEDCO\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u71b5\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1183.5%\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "EDCO\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7f16\u6392\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u71b5\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We introduce a performance-aware, closed-loop solution in the NNGPT ecosystem of projects that enables LLMs to autonomously engineer optimal transformations by internalizing empirical performance cues. We fine-tune LLMs with Low-Rank Adaptation on a novel repository of more than 6,000 empirically evaluated PyTorch augmentation functions, each annotated solely by downstream model accuracy. Training uses pairwise performance ordering (better-worse transformations), enabling alignment through empirical feedback without reinforcement learning, reward models, or symbolic objectives. This reduces the need for exhaustive search, achieving up to 600x times fewer evaluated candidates than brute-force discovery while maintaining competitive peak accuracy and shifting generation from random synthesis to task-aligned design. Ablation studies show that structured Chain-of-Thought prompting introduces syntactic noise and degrades performance, whereas direct prompting ensures stable optimization in performance-critical code tasks. Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that the model internalizes semantic performance cues rather than memorizing syntax. These results show that LLMs can exhibit task-level reasoning through non-textual feedback loops, bypassing explicit symbolic rewards.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6027\u80fd\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728NNGPT\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u81ea\u4e3b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8d85\u8fc76000\u4e2a\u7ecf\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684PyTorch\u589e\u5f3a\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\uff08LoRA\uff09\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0b\u6e38\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u6210\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u6392\u5e8f\uff08\u4f18-\u52a3\uff09\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u7b26\u53f7\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5019\u9009\u65b9\u6848\u6570\u91cf\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe600\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u5cf0\u503c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f7f\u751f\u6210\u4ece\u968f\u673a\u5408\u6210\u8f6c\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u6cd5\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u5173\u952e\u4ee3\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5316\u7684\u662f\u8bed\u4e49\u6027\u80fd\u7ebf\u7d22\u800c\u975e\u8bed\u6cd5\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLM\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u6587\u672c\u53cd\u9988\u73af\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u7b26\u53f7\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u4ecd\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6216\u66b4\u529b\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u3002\u5982\u4f55\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u53cd\u9988\u81ea\u4e3b\u4f18\u5316\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8d85\u8fc76000\u4e2a\u7ecf\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684PyTorch\u589e\u5f3a\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\uff08LoRA\uff09\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u6392\u5e8f\uff08\u5373\u66f4\u4f18\u4e0e\u66f4\u5dee\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u9a8c\u53cd\u9988\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u7b26\u53f7\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u66b4\u529b\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c11600\u500d\u7684\u5019\u9009\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u4ece\u968f\u673a\u5408\u6210\u8f6c\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5185\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u6027\u80fd\u7ebf\u7d22\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bed\u6cd5\uff1b\u5728\u65e0\u663e\u5f0f\u7b26\u53f7\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u6587\u672c\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u501f\u52a9\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u80fd\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u6211\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6446\u8131\u5bf9\u7b26\u53f7\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u4ee3\u7801\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Yet forecast users often face a difficult trade-off. Many decision-relevant targets are functionals of the atmospheric state variables, such as extrema, accumulations, and threshold exceedances, rather than state variables themselves. As a result, users must estimate these targets via post-processing, which can be suboptimal and can introduce structural bias. The core issue is that decisions depend on distributions over these functionals that the model is not trained to learn directly.\n  In this work, we introduce GEM-2, a probabilistic transformer that jointly learns global atmospheric dynamics alongside a suite of variables that users directly act upon. Using this training recipe, we show that a lightweight (~275M params) and computationally efficient (~20-100x training speedup relative to state-of-the-art) transformer trained on the CRPS objective can directly outperform operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and be competitive with ML models that rely on expensive multi-step diffusion processes or require bespoke multi-stage fine-tuning strategies. We further demonstrate state-of-the-art economic value metrics under decision-theoretic evaluation, stable convergence to climatology at S2S and seasonal timescales, and a surprising insensitivity to many commonly assumed architectural and training design choices.", "AI": {"tldr": "GEM-2 \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6982\u7387\u6027 Transformer \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u5168\u7403\u5927\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u7528\u6237\u76f4\u63a5\u51b3\u7b56\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728 CRPS \u76ee\u6807\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\uff08\u7ea6 275M \u53c2\u6570\uff09\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347 20-100 \u500d\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u4e8e\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u6570\u503c\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\uff08NWP\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u591a\u6b65\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6216\u7279\u5b9a\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002\u5b83\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4ef7\u503c\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5728\u5b63\u8282\u548c\u6b21\u5b63\u8282\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u6c14\u5019\u6001\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u5e38\u89c1\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u610f\u5916\u7684\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u5f71\u54cd\u7535\u7f51\u8fd0\u884c\u3001\u822a\u7a7a\u3001\u519c\u4e1a\u548c\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4f46\u7528\u6237\u5e38\u9762\u4e34\u6743\u8861\u56f0\u5883\uff1a\u8bb8\u591a\u51b3\u7b56\u76f8\u5173\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5927\u6c14\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5982\u6781\u503c\u3001\u7d2f\u79ef\u91cf\u3001\u9608\u503c\u8d85\u8d8a\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u91cf\u672c\u8eab\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u5904\u7406\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b21\u4f18\u7ed3\u679c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u76f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd9\u4e9b\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa GEM-2 \u6982\u7387\u6027 Transformer \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u5927\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\uff1b\u91c7\u7528 CRPS \u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u51b3\u7b56\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u540e\u5904\u7406\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "GEM-2 \u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff1a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027 NWP \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5ab2\u7f8e\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6b65\u6269\u6563\u6216\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5fae\u8c03\u7684 ML \u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5728\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4ef7\u503c\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u9886\u5148\u6c34\u5e73\uff1b\u5728\u6b21\u5b63\u8282\u548c\u5b63\u8282\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u6c14\u5019\u6001\uff1b\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u914d\u7f6e\u53d8\u5316\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "GEM-2 \u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u5efa\u6a21\u51b3\u7b56\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6c14\u8c61\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Researchers are burdened with tracking numerous experiments, design choices, and their effects on performance, often relying on ad-hoc, manual workflows that are inherently slow and error-prone. We introduce EvalBlocks, a modular, plug-and-play framework for efficient evaluation of foundation models during development. Built on Snakemake, EvalBlocks supports seamless integration of new datasets, foundation models, aggregation methods, and evaluation strategies. All experiments and results are tracked centrally and are reproducible with a single command, while efficient caching and parallel execution enable scalable use on shared compute infrastructure. Demonstrated on five state-of-the-art foundation models and three medical imaging classification tasks, EvalBlocks streamlines model evaluation, enabling researchers to iterate faster and focus on model innovation rather than evaluation logistics.

To address this challenge, we introduce eTracer, a plug-and-play framework that enables traceable text generation by grounding claims against contextual evidence. Through post-hoc grounding, each response claim is aligned with contextual evidence that either supports or contradicts it. Building on claim-level grounding results, eTracer not only enables users to precisely trace responses back to their contextual source but also quantifies response faithfulness, thereby enabling the verifiability and trustworthiness of generated responses. Experiments show that our claim-level grounding approach alleviates the limitations of conventional grounding methods in aligning generated statements with contextual sentence-level evidence, resulting in substantial improvements in overall grounding quality and user verification efficiency.

Among these parameters, Gaussian means are particularly difficult to predict, so depth is usually estimated first and then unprojected to obtain the Gaussian sphere centers. Existing methods typically rely solely on a single warp to estimate depth probability, which hinders their ability to fully leverage cross-view geometric cues, resulting in unstable and coarse depth maps. To address this limitation, we propose IDESplat, which iteratively applies warp operations to boost depth probability estimation for accurate Gaussian mean prediction. First, to eliminate the inherent instability of a single warp, we introduce a Depth Probability Boosting Unit (DPBU) that integrates epipolar attention maps produced by cascading warp operations in a multiplicative manner. Next, we construct an iterative depth estimation process by stacking multiple DPBUs, progressively identifying potential depth candidates with high likelihood. As IDESplat iteratively boosts depth probability estimates and updates the depth candidates, the depth map is gradually refined, resulting in accurate Gaussian means. We conduct experiments on RealEstate10K, ACID, and DL3DV. IDESplat achieves outstanding reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art performance with real-time efficiency. On RE10K, it outperforms DepthSplat by 0.33 dB in PSNR, using only 10.7% of the parameters and 70% of the memory.

We introduce DisastQA, a large-scale benchmark of 3,000 rigorously verified questions (2,000 multiple-choice and 1,000 open-ended) spanning eight disaster types. The benchmark is constructed via a human-LLM collaboration pipeline with stratified sampling to ensure balanced coverage. Models are evaluated under varying evidence conditions, from closed-book to noisy evidence integration, enabling separation of internal knowledge from reasoning under imperfect information. For open-ended QA, we propose a human-verified keypoint-based evaluation protocol emphasizing factual completeness over verbosity. Experiments with 20 models reveal substantial divergences from general-purpose leaderboards such as MMLU-Pro. While recent open-weight models approach proprietary systems in clean settings, performance degrades sharply under realistic noise, exposing critical reliability gaps for disaster response.

In this paper, we propose a novel Zero-shot Prompt Tuning (ZPT) framework to address this problem by leveraging a Universal Bimodal Conditional Generator (UBCG). Our approach begins with pre-training a graph-language model to capture both the graph structure and the associated textual descriptions of each node. Following this, a conditional generative model is trained to learn the joint distribution of nodes in both graph and text modalities, enabling the generation of synthetic samples for each class based solely on the class name. These synthetic node and text embeddings are subsequently used to perform continuous prompt tuning, facilitating effective node classification in a zero-shot setting. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating that our framework performs better than existing state-of-the-art baselines. We also provide ablation studies to validate the contribution of the bimodal generator.

Currently, obtaining accurate segmentation outcomes is critically reliant on large-scale datasets with high-quality annotations. However, noisy annotations are frequently encountered owing to the complex morphological structures of organs in medical images and variations among different annotators, which can substantially limit the efficacy of segmentation models. Motivated by the fact that medical imaging annotator can correct labeling errors during segmentation based on prior knowledge, we propose an end-to-end Staged Voxel-Level Deep Reinforcement Learning (SVL-DRL) framework for robust medical image segmentation under noisy annotations. This framework employs a dynamic iterative update strategy to automatically mitigate the impact of erroneous labels without requiring manual intervention. The key advancements of SVL-DRL over existing works include: i) formulating noisy annotations as a voxel-dependent problem and addressing it through a novel staged reinforcement learning framework which guarantees robust model convergence; ii) incorporating a voxel-level asynchronous advantage actor-critic (vA3C) module that conceptualizes each voxel as an autonomous agent, which allows each agent to dynamically refine its own state representation during training, thereby directly mitigating the influence of erroneous labels; iii) designing a novel action space for the agents, along with a composite reward function that strategically combines the Dice value and a spatial continuity metric to significantly boost segmentation accuracy while maintain semantic integrity. Experiments on three public medical image datasets demonstrates State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance under various experimental settings, with an average improvement of over 3\\% in both Dice and IoU scores.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u4f53\u7d20\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\uff08SVL-DRL\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8fed\u4ee3\u66f4\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u81ea\u52a8\u7f13\u89e3\u9519\u8bef\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f53\u7d20\u89c6\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4f53\u7d20\u7ea7\u5f02\u6b65\u4f18\u52bf\u6f14\u5458-\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u6a21\u5757\uff08vA3C\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5305\u542bDice\u5206\u6570\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u590d\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e73\u5747Dice\u548cIoU\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc73%\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u56e0\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u53d7\u4e13\u5bb6\u53ef\u57fa\u4e8e\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fee\u6b63\u6807\u6ce8\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u4f53\u7d20\u7ea7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff08SVL-DRL\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u6ce8\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4f53\u7d20\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u8fed\u4ee3\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4f53\u7d20\u7ea7\u5f02\u6b65\u4f18\u52bf\u6f14\u5458-\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\uff08vA3C\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4f7f\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f53\u7d20\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u81ea\u8eab\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u578b\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u878d\u5408Dice\u503c\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u590d\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e73\u5747Dice\u548cIoU\u5f97\u5206\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d85\u8fc73%\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "SVL-DRL\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u6ce8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f53\u7d20\u7ea7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0b\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In India, the crops are widely affected by floods; therefore, making rapid and accurate crop damage assessment is crucial for effective post-disaster agricultural management. Traditional manual surveys are slow and biased, while current satellite-based methods face challenges like cloud cover and low spatial resolution. Therefore, to bridge this gap, this paper introduced FLNet, a novel deep learning based architecture that used super-resolution to enhance the 10 m spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 satellite images into 3 m resolution before classifying damage. We tested our model on the Bihar Flood Impacted Croplands Dataset (BFCD-22), and the results showed an improved critical \"Full Damage\" F1-score from 0.83 to 0.89, nearly matching the 0.89 score of commercial high-resolution imagery.

Semantic backdoors are significantly harder to detect than backdoors that are based on trigger patterns due to the lack of such clearly identifiable patterns. We tackle this problem under the assumption that the clean training dataset and the training recipe of the model are both known. These assumptions are motivated by a consumer protection scenario, in which the responsible authority performs mystery shopping to test a machine learning service provider. In this scenario, the authority uses the provider's resources and tools to train a model on a given dataset and tests whether the provider included a backdoor. In our proposed approach, the authority creates a reference model pool by training a small number of clean and poisoned models using trusted infrastructure, and calibrates a model distance threshold to identify clean models. We propose and experimentally analyze a number of approaches to compute model distances and we also test a scenario where the provider performs an adaptive attack to avoid detection. The most reliable method is based on requesting adversarial training from the provider. The model distance is best measured using a set of input samples generated by inverting the models in such a way as to maximize the distance from clean samples. With these settings, our method can often completely separate clean and poisoned models, and it proves to be superior to state-of-the-art backdoor detectors as well.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bed\u4e49\u540e\u95e8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u67d0\u4e9b\u81ea\u7136\u4f46\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u53ef\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u522b\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u663e\u89e6\u53d1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6b64\u7c7b\u540e\u95e8\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5047\u8bbe\u6e05\u6d01\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5df2\u77e5\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u4fdd\u62a4\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u5efa\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u6c60\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u8ddd\u79bb\u9608\u503c\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u5e72\u51c0\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u8ddd\u79bb\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5411\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u8bf7\u6c42\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6700\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u8f6c\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4e0e\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u533a\u5206\u5e72\u51c0\u4e0e\u4e2d\u6bd2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u540e\u95e8\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u4e49\u540e\u95e8\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u89e6\u53d1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u6076\u610f\u5229\u7528\u3002\u4e3a\u4fdd\u969c\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u53ef\u4fe1\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u88ab\u690d\u5165\u540e\u95e8\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u4fdd\u62a4\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u4e3b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u68c0\u9a8c\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u6c60\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u4fe1\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c11\u91cf\u5e72\u51c0\u4e0e\u4e2d\u6bd2\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u8bbe\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u8ddd\u79bb\u9608\u503c\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u6f14\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u624b\u6bb5\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u5b8c\u5168\u5206\u79bb\u5e72\u51c0\u4e0e\u4e2d\u6bd2\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bf7\u6c42\u548c\u53cd\u6f14\u6837\u672c\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u6c60\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bf7\u6c42\u4e0e\u53cd\u6f14\u6837\u672c\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bed\u4e49\u540e\u95e8\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

We systematically analyze this limitation, focusing on logical relationship understanding, which is a core capability underlying genuine logical reasoning, and reveal that errors related to this capability account for over 90\\% of incorrect predictions, with Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (CoT-SFT) failing to substantially reduce these errors. To address this bottleneck, we propose First-Step Logical Reasoning (FSLR), a lightweight training framework targeting logical relationship understanding. Our key insight is that the first planning step-identifying which variables to use and which operation to apply-encourages the model to derive logical relationships directly from the problem statement. By training models on this isolated step, FSLR provides explicit supervision for logical relationship understanding, unlike CoT-SFT which implicitly embeds such relationships within complete solution trajectories. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that FSLR consistently outperforms CoT-SFT under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, with average improvements of 3.2\\% and 4.6\\%, respectively.

We propose a structured evaluation framework for AI story generation comprising four components (Novelty, Value, Adherence, and Resonance) and eleven sub-components. Using controlled story generation via ``Spike Prompting'' and a crowdsourced study of 115 readers, we examine how different creative components shape both immediate and reflective human creativity judgments. Our findings show that creativity is evaluated hierarchically rather than cumulatively, with different dimensions becoming salient at different stages of judgment, and that reflective evaluation substantially alters both ratings and inter-rater agreement. Together, these results support the effectiveness of our framework in revealing dimensions of creativity that are obscured by reference-based evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684AI\u6545\u4e8b\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u3001\u4ef7\u503c\u3001\u7b26\u5408\u5ea6\u548c\u5171\u9e23\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u53ca\u5341\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b50\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u63a7\u6545\u4e8b\u751f\u6210\uff08Spike Prompting\uff09\u548c115\u540d\u8bfb\u8005\u7684\u4f17\u5305\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u521b\u9020\u529b\u8bc4\u4ef7\u662f\u5206\u5c42\u6b21\u800c\u975e\u7d2f\u79ef\u7684\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5728\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u663e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53cd\u601d\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u8bc4\u4ef7\u8005\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6240\u63a9\u76d6\u7684\u521b\u9020\u529b\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u521b\u9020\u529b\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u51c6\u786e\u8861\u91cfAI\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u7684\u521b\u9020\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Spike Prompting\u8fdb\u884c\u53d7\u63a7\u6545\u4e8b\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f17\u5305\u65b9\u5f0f\u6536\u96c6115\u540d\u8bfb\u8005\u5bf9\u6545\u4e8b\u7684\u5373\u65f6\u4e0e\u53cd\u601d\u6027\u8bc4\u4ef7\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5404\u521b\u9020\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u521b\u9020\u529b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u521b\u9020\u529b\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5177\u6709\u5c42\u7ea7\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5728\u8bc4\u4ef7\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9636\u6bb5\u6027\u51f8\u663e\uff1b\u53cd\u601d\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc4\u5206\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u8bc4\u4ef7\u8005\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63ed\u793a\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u521b\u9020\u529b\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u7684\u521b\u9020\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

However, screenshots are tokenized into thousands of visual tokens (e.g., about 4700 for 2K resolution), incurring significant computational overhead and diluting attention. In contrast, humans typically focus on regions of interest when interacting with UI. In this work, we pioneer the task of efficient UI grounding. Guided by practical analysis of the task's characteristics and challenges, we propose FocusUI, an efficient UI grounding framework that selects patches most relevant to the instruction while preserving positional continuity for precise grounding. FocusUI addresses two key challenges: (1) Eliminating redundant tokens in visual encoding. We construct patch-level supervision by fusing an instruction-conditioned score with a rule-based UI-graph score that down-weights large homogeneous regions to select distinct and instruction-relevant visual tokens. (2) Preserving positional continuity during visual token selection. We find that general visual token pruning methods suffer from severe accuracy degradation on UI grounding tasks due to broken positional information. We introduce a novel PosPad strategy, which compresses each contiguous sequence of dropped visual tokens into a single special marker placed at the sequence's last index to preserve positional continuity. Comprehensive experiments on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that FocusUI surpasses GUI-specific baselines. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, FocusUI-7B achieves a performance improvement of 3.7% over GUI-Actor-7B. Even with only 30% visual token retention, FocusUI-7B drops by only 3.2% while achieving up to 1.44x faster inference and 17% lower peak GPU memory.", "AI": {"tldr": "FocusUI\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684UI\u63a5\u5730\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8865\u4e01\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u622a\u56fe\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7a00\u91ca\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u6307\u4ee4\u6761\u4ef6\u5f97\u5206\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684UI\u56fe\u5f97\u5206\u6765\u7b5b\u9009\u5173\u952e\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165PosPad\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFocusUI\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728ScreenSpot-Pro\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53473.7%\uff0c\u4ec5\u4fdd\u755930%\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u65f6\u4ecd\u4fdd\u630196.8%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53471.44\u500d\uff0c\u663e\u5b58\u964d\u4f4e17%\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u622a\u56fe\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u91cf\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7a00\u91ca\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ea4\u4e92\u901a\u5e38\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684UI\u63a5\u5730\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFocusUI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\uff1a(1) \u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u6307\u4ee4\u6761\u4ef6\u5f97\u5206\u4e0e\u89c4\u5219\u9a71\u52a8\u7684UI\u56fe\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5197\u4f59\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u5254\u9664\uff1b(2) \u5f15\u5165PosPad\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u88ab\u5220\u9664\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u5e8f\u5217\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u5355\u4e2a\u7279\u6b8a\u6807\u8bb0\u5e76\u7f6e\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u672b\u5c3e\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFocusUI\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709GUI\u4e13\u7528\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5728ScreenSpot-Pro\u4e0a\uff0cFocusUI-7B\u76f8\u6bd4GUI-Actor-7B\u63d0\u53473.7%\uff1b\u5373\u4f7f\u4ec5\u4fdd\u755930%\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u4ec53.2%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53471.44\u500d\uff0c\u5cf0\u503cGPU\u5185\u5b58\u964d\u4f4e17%\u3002", "conclusion": "FocusUI\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u5173\u952e\u89c6\u89c9\u8865\u4e01\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7cbe\u786e\u7684UI\u63a5\u5730\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u9ad8\u6548\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods struggle to achieve robust performance on real-world domains such as medical imaging, or are inefficient when handling non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) data. To address these limitations, we introduce FALCON, a framework that enhances the effectiveness of OSFL over non-IID image data. The core idea of FALCON is to leverage the feature-aware hierarchical token sequences generation and knowledge distillation into OSFL. First, each client leverages a pretrained visual encoder with hierarchical scale encoding to compress images into hierarchical token sequences, which capture multi-scale semantics. Second, a multi-scale autoregressive transformer generator is used to model the distribution of these token sequences and generate the synthetic sequences.

Although early-exit strategies have proven effective in reducing computational demands by halting inference earlier, they apply either to only the first token in the generation phase or at the prompt level in the prefill phase. Thus, the Key-Value (KV) cache for skipped layers remains a bottleneck for subsequent token generation, limiting the benefits of early exit. We introduce ADEPT (Adaptive Dynamic Early-exit Process for Transformers), a novel approach designed to overcome this issue and enable dynamic early exit in both the prefill and generation phases. The proposed adaptive token-level early-exit mechanism adjusts computation dynamically based on token complexity, optimizing efficiency without compromising performance. ADEPT further enhances KV generation procedure by decoupling sequential dependencies in skipped layers, making token-level early exit more practical.

Despite this, existing human motion synthesis methods fall short: some ignore hand motions entirely, while others generate full-body motions only for narrowly scoped tasks under highly constrained settings. A key obstacle is the lack of large-scale datasets that jointly capture diverse full-body motion with detailed hand articulation. While some datasets capture both, they are limited in scale and diversity. Conversely, large-scale datasets typically focus either on body motion without hands or on hand motions without the body. To overcome this, we curate and unify existing hand motion datasets with large-scale body motion data to generate full-body sequences that capture both hand and body. We then propose the first diffusion-based unconditional full-body motion prior, FUSION, which jointly models body and hand motion. Despite using a pose-based motion representation, FUSION surpasses state-of-the-art skeletal control models on the Keypoint Tracking task in the HumanML3D dataset and achieves superior motion naturalness. Beyond standard benchmarks, we demonstrate that FUSION can go beyond typical uses of motion priors through two applications: (1) generating detailed full-body motion including fingers during interaction given the motion of an object, and (2) generating Self-Interaction motions using an LLM to transform natural language cues into actionable motion constraints. For these applications, we develop an optimization pipeline that refines the latent space of our diffusion model to generate task-specific motions. Experiments on these tasks highlight precise control over hand motion while maintaining plausible full-body coordination.

To address these challenges, we propose PosterVerse, a full-workflow, commercial-grade poster generation method that seamlessly automates the entire design process while delivering high-density and scalable text rendering. PosterVerse replicates professional design through three key stages: (1) blueprint creation using fine-tuned LLMs to extract key design elements from user requirements, (2) graphical background generation via customized diffusion models to create visually appealing imagery, and (3) unified layout-text rendering with an MLLM-powered HTML engine to guarantee high text accuracy and flexible customization. In addition, we introduce PosterDNA, a commercial-grade, HTML-based dataset tailored for training and validating poster design models. To the best of our knowledge, PosterDNA is the first Chinese poster generation dataset to introduce HTML typography files, enabling scalable text rendering and fundamentally solving the challenges of rendering small and high-density text. Experimental results demonstrate that PosterVerse consistently produces commercial-grade posters with appealing visuals, accurate text alignment, and customizable layouts, making it a promising solution for automating commercial poster design.

A Close Look at DeepSeek-OCR", "comment": null, "summary": "DeepSeek-OCR utilizes an optical 2D mapping approach to achieve high-ratio vision-text compression, claiming to decode text tokens exceeding ten times the input visual tokens. While this suggests a promising solution for the LLM long-context bottleneck, we investigate a critical question: \"Visual merit or linguistic crutch - which drives DeepSeek-OCR's performance?\" By employing sentence-level and word-level semantic corruption, we isolate the model's intrinsic OCR capabilities from its language priors. Results demonstrate that without linguistic support, DeepSeek-OCR's performance plummets from approximately 90% to 20%. Comparative benchmarking against 13 baseline models reveals that traditional pipeline OCR methods exhibit significantly higher robustness to such semantic perturbations than end-to-end methods. Furthermore, we find that lower visual token counts correlate with increased reliance on priors, exacerbating hallucination risks. Context stress testing also reveals a total model collapse around 10,000 text tokens, suggesting that current optical compression techniques may paradoxically aggravate the long-context bottleneck. This study empirically defines DeepSeek-OCR's capability boundaries and offers essential insights for future optimizations of the vision-text compression paradigm.

Yu", "Xiao-Ming Wu"], "title": "FOREVER: Forgetting Curve-Inspired Memory Replay for Language Model Continual Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "Continual learning (CL) for large language models (LLMs) aims to enable sequential knowledge acquisition without catastrophic forgetting. Memory replay methods are widely used for their practicality and effectiveness, but most rely on fixed, step-based heuristics that often misalign with the model's actual learning progress, since identical training steps can result in varying degrees of parameter change. Motivated by recent findings that LLM forgetting mirrors the Ebbinghaus human forgetting curve, we propose FOREVER (FORgEtting curVe-inspired mEmory Replay), a novel CL framework that aligns replay schedules with a model-centric notion of time. FOREVER defines model time using the magnitude of optimizer updates, allowing forgetting curve-inspired replay intervals to align with the model's internal evolution rather than raw training steps. Building on this approach, FOREVER incorporates a forgetting curve-based replay scheduler to determine when to replay and an intensity-aware regularization mechanism to adaptively control how to replay.

Our use of explainability techniques, including SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), enabled us to illustrate significant feature-cancer stage interactions that would have remained hidden in traditional black-box models. We identified how certain demographic and clinical variables influenced survival differently across cancer stages and types.

Central to automating these inspections is the accurate segmentation of turbine blades from visual data. This task is traditionally addressed through dense, pixel-wise deep learning models. However, such methods demand extensive annotated datasets, posing scalability challenges. In this work, we introduce an annotation-efficient segmentation approach that reframes the pixel-level task into a binary region classification problem.

Existing Direct Preference Otimization (DPO) methods rely on multi-sample ranking and task-specific critic models, which is inefficient and often yields ambiguous global supervision. To address these limitations, we propose LocalDPO, a novel post-training framework that constructs localized preference pairs from real videos and optimizes alignment at the spatio-temporal region level. We design an automated pipeline to efficiently collect preference pair data that generates preference pairs with a single inference per prompt, eliminating the need for external critic models or manual annotation. Specifically, we treat high-quality real videos as positive samples and generate corresponding negatives by locally corrupting them with random spatio-temporal masks and restoring only the masked regions using the frozen base model. During training, we introduce a region-aware DPO loss that restricts preference learning to corrupted areas for rapid convergence. Experiments on Wan2.1 and CogVideoX demonstrate that LocalDPO consistently improves video fidelity, temporal coherence and human preference scores over other post-training approaches, establishing a more efficient and fine-grained paradigm for video generator alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLocalDPO\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u7a7a\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u7684DPO\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08DPO\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u6837\u672c\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8bc4\u5224\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u6a21\u7cca\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u65f6\u7a7a\u63a9\u7801\u5c40\u90e8\u7834\u574f\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6062\u590d\u751f\u6210\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u7684DPO\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u53d7\u635f\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Wan2.1\u548cCogVideoX\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cLocalDPO\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u7cbe\u7ec6\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LocalDPO\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5bf9\u9f50\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Due to better interpretability, it is a machine learning paradigm particularly powerful for scientific discovery. In recent years, several works have expanded the concept to allow the description of similar phenomena using a single expression with varying sets of parameters, thereby introducing categorical variables. Some previous works allow only \"non-shared\" (category-value-specific) parameters, and others also incorporate \"shared\" (category-value-agnostic) parameters. We expand upon those efforts by considering multiple categorical variables, and introducing intermediate levels of parameter sharing. With two categorical variables, an intermediate level of parameter sharing emerges, i.e., parameters which are shared across either category but change across the other. The new approach potentially decreases the number of parameters, while revealing additional information about the problem.

However, the robustness of their reasoning chains remains questionable. In this paper, we identify a critical failure mode termed textual inertia, where once a textual hallucination occurs in the thinking process, models tend to blindly adhere to the erroneous text while neglecting conflicting visual evidence. To systematically investigate this, we propose the LogicGraph Perturbation Protocol that structurally injects perturbations into the reasoning chains of diverse LMMs spanning both native reasoning architectures and prompt-driven paradigms to evaluate their self-reflection capabilities. The results reveal that models successfully self-correct in less than 10% of cases and predominantly succumb to blind textual error propagation. To mitigate this, we introduce Active Visual-Context Refinement, a training-free inference paradigm which orchestrates an active visual re-grounding mechanism to enforce fine-grained verification coupled with an adaptive context refinement strategy to summarize and denoise the reasoning history. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly stifles hallucination propagation and enhances reasoning robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08LMMs\uff09\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u56e0\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3a\u2018\u6587\u672c\u60ef\u6027\u2019\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u4e00\u65e6\u51fa\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u76f2\u76ee\u575a\u6301\u9519\u8bef\u6587\u672c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u903b\u8f91\u56fe\u6270\u52a8\u534f\u8bae\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cdLMM\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u7ea0\u6b63\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e10%\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u9677\u5165\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u3002\u4e3a\u7f13\u89e3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u2014\u2014\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7cbe\u70bc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7cbe\u70bc\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5386\u53f2\u53bb\u566a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6291\u5236\u5e7b\u89c9\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6613\u53d7\u6587\u672c\u5e7b\u89c9\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5f53\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u51b2\u7a81\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u56fa\u5b88\u9519\u8bef\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u6548\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u903b\u8f91\u56fe\u6270\u52a8\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6ce8\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540cLMM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9-\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7cbe\u70bc\uff08Active Visual-Context Refinement\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7cbe\u70bc\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u5386\u53f2\u53bb\u566a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u5e7b\u89c9\u65f6\u65e0\u6cd5\u81ea\u7ea0\u6b63\uff0c\u81ea\u7ea0\u6b63\u7387\u4e0d\u8db310%\uff1b\u800c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9-\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7cbe\u70bc\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u672c\u60ef\u6027\u662f\u5236\u7ea6LMM\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u6587\u672c\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u7ea0\u9519\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7cbe\u70bc\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u5e7b\u89c9\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

The highly nonlinear motion-to-configuration relationship means small perturbations in joint positions drastically alter trajectories, while the combinatorially expanding design space renders conventional optimization and heuristic methods computationally intractable. We introduce an autoregressive diffusion framework that exploits the dyadic nature of linkage assembly by representing mechanisms as sequentially constructed graphs, where nodes correspond to joints and edges to rigid links. Our approach combines a causal transformer with a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), both conditioned on target trajectories encoded via a transformer encoder. The causal transformer autoregressively predicts discrete topology node-by-node, while the DDPM refines each node's spatial coordinates and edge connectivity to previously generated nodes. This sequential generation enables adaptive trial-and-error synthesis where problematic nodes exhibiting kinematic locking or collisions can be selectively regenerated, allowing autonomous correction of degenerate configurations during design. Our graph-based, data-driven methodology surpasses traditional optimization approaches, enabling scalable inverse design that generalizes to mechanisms with arbitrary node counts. We demonstrate successful synthesis of linkage systems containing up to 20 nodes with extensibility to N-node architectures.

Previous research has shown that they can be misused for generation of personalized disinformation in multiple languages. It has also been observed that personalization negatively affects detectability of machine-generated texts; however, this has been studied in the English language only. In this work, we examine this phenomenon across 10 languages, while we focus not only on potential misuse of personalization capabilities, but also on potential benefits they offer. Overall, we cover 1080 combinations of various personalization aspects in the prompts, for which the texts are generated by 16 distinct language models (17,280 texts in total).

We repurpose the VGGT reconstruction model to produce geometric latents by training an adapter on its tokens, which are regularized to align with the appearance latents of pre-trained video diffusion models. By jointly generating these disentangled yet aligned latents, Gen3R produces both RGB videos and corresponding 3D geometry, including camera poses, depth maps, and global point clouds. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in single- and multi-image conditioned 3D scene generation.

Evaluating Counterfactual Simulatability with Pragmatic Perturbations", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce verbalized self-explanations, yet prior studies suggest that such rationales may not reliably reflect the model's true decision process. We ask whether these explanations nevertheless help users predict model behavior, operationalized as counterfactual simulatability. Using StrategyQA, we evaluate how well humans and LLM judges can predict a model's answers to counterfactual follow-up questions, with and without access to the model's chain-of-thought or post-hoc explanations. We compare LLM-generated counterfactuals with pragmatics-based perturbations as alternative ways to construct test cases for assessing the potential usefulness of explanations. Our results show that self-explanations consistently improve simulation accuracy for both LLM judges and humans, but the degree and stability of gains depend strongly on the perturbation strategy and judge strength. We also conduct a qualitative analysis of free-text justifications written by human users when predicting the model's behavior, which provides evidence that access to explanations helps humans form more accurate predictions on the perturbed questions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7684\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u662f\u5426\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7StrategyQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLM\u88c1\u5224\u5728\u6709\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u6216\u4e8b\u540e\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLM\u88c1\u5224\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u63d0\u5347\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6270\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u88c1\u5224\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u7531\u6587\u672c\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8bbf\u95ee\u89e3\u91ca\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5f62\u6210\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u53cd\u6620\u5176\u771f\u5b9e\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89e3\u91ca\u662f\u5426\u4ecd\u80fd\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u68c0\u9a8c\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528StrategyQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLM\u88c1\u5224\u5728\u6709/\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6270\u52a8\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u7528\u5b66\u7684\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6709\u7528\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLM\u88c1\u5224\u5bf9\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u6270\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u88c1\u5224\u80fd\u529b\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u7528\u5b66\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u76f8\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u66f4\u5177\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7528\u6237\u5728\u83b7\u5f97\u89e3\u91ca\u540e\u80fd\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7406\u7531\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u672a\u5fc5\u5fe0\u5b9e\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u786e\u5b9e\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5408\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u5728\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

However, current models often suffer from logical hallucinations, where correct answers are derived from flawed reasoning chains or rely on positional shortcuts rather than spatial logic. This decoupling undermines reliability in strategic spatial decision-making. To address this, we present GeoReason, a framework designed to synchronize internal thinking with final decisions. We first construct GeoReason-Bench, a logic-driven dataset containing 4,000 reasoning trajectories synthesized from geometric primitives and expert knowledge. We then formulate a two-stage training strategy: (1) Supervised Knowledge Initialization to equip the model with reasoning syntax and domain expertise, and (2) Consistency-Aware Reinforcement Learning to refine deductive reliability. This second stage integrates a novel Logical Consistency Reward, which penalizes logical drift via an option permutation strategy to anchor decisions in verifiable reasoning traces. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the cognitive reliability and interpretability of RS-VLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to other advanced methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGeoReason\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u9065\u611f\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u903b\u8f91\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6GeoReason-Bench\u548c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u76d1\u7763\u77e5\u8bc6\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u903b\u8f91\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u9065\u611f\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7a7a\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u6216\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6377\u5f84\u800c\u975e\u7a7a\u95f4\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaGeoReason-Bench\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b4000\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u539f\u578b\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u5408\u6210\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a(1) \u76d1\u7763\u77e5\u8bc6\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u8d4b\u4e88\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u6cd5\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b(2) \u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u9009\u9879\u6392\u5217\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u60e9\u7f5a\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9065\u611f\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9879\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u903b\u8f91\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "GeoReason\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u6b65\u5185\u90e8\u601d\u8003\u4e0e\u6700\u7ec8\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u9065\u611f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We propose Dynafit, a kernel-based method for learning a distance metric between training trajectories and the underlying dynamics. New observations are assigned to the class with the most similar dynamics according to the learned metric. The learning algorithm approximates the Koopman operator which globally linearizes the dynamics in a (potentially infinite) feature space associated with a kernel function. The distance metric is computed in feature space independently of its dimensionality by using the kernel trick common in machine learning.

The functional contrasts between sentences characterized by right branching vs. center embedding or unambiguous vs. ambiguous relative clause attachment are also picked up by ID, but in a less marked way, and they do not correlate with the same processing phase.

However, most deep learning models are designed to process either entire images or complete time series sequences to extract meaningful features for downstream tasks. In this study, we propose a novel multimodal approach that leverages pixel-wise two-dimensional (2D) representations to encode visual property variations from SITS more effectively. Specifically, we generate recurrence plots from pixel-based vegetation index time series (NDVI, EVI, and SAVI) as an alternative to using raw pixel values, creating more informative representations. Additionally, we introduce PIxel-wise Multimodal Contrastive (PIMC), a new multimodal self-supervision approach that produces effective encoders based on two-dimensional pixel time series representations and remote sensing imagery (RSI). To validate our approach, we assess its performance on three downstream tasks: pixel-level forecasting and classification using the PASTIS dataset, and land cover classification on the EuroSAT dataset. Moreover, we compare our results to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on all downstream tasks. Our experimental results show that the use of 2D representations significantly enhances feature extraction from SITS, while contrastive learning improves the quality of representations for both pixel time series and RSI. These findings suggest that our multimodal method outperforms existing models in various Earth observation tasks, establishing it as a robust self-supervision framework for processing both SITS and RSI.

We propose CausalMixFT, a method that enhances fine-tuning robustness and downstream performance by generating structurally consistent synthetic samples using Structural Causal Models (SCMs) fitted on the target dataset. This approach augments limited real data with causally informed synthetic examples, preserving feature dependencies while expanding training diversity. Evaluated across 33 classification datasets from TabArena and over 2300 fine-tuning runs, our CausalMixFT method consistently improves median normalized ROC-AUC from 0.10 (standard fine-tuning) to 0.12, outperforming purely statistical generators such as CTGAN (-0.01), TabEBM (-0.04), and TableAugment (-0.09). Moreover, it narrows the median validation-test performance correlation gap from 0.67 to 0.30, enabling more reliable validation-based early stopping, a key step toward improving fine-tuning stability under data scarcity.

This paper takes the first step to investigate whether ALLMs inadvertently leak user privacy solely through acoustic voiceprints and introduces $\\textit{HearSay}$, a comprehensive benchmark constructed from over 22,000 real-world audio clips. To ensure data quality, the benchmark is meticulously curated through a rigorous pipeline involving automated profiling and human verification, guaranteeing that all privacy labels are grounded in factual records. Extensive experiments on $\\textit{HearSay}$ yield three critical findings: $\\textbf{Significant Privacy Leakage}$: ALLMs inherently extract private attributes from voiceprints, reaching 92.89% accuracy on gender and effectively profiling social attributes. $\\textbf{Insufficient Safety Mechanisms}$: Alarmingly, existing safeguards are severely inadequate; most models fail to refuse privacy-intruding requests, exhibiting near-zero refusal rates for physiological traits. $\\textbf{Reasoning Amplifies Risk}$: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning exacerbates privacy risks in capable models by uncovering deeper acoustic correlations. These findings expose critical vulnerabilities in ALLMs, underscoring the urgent need for targeted privacy alignment.

Non-commercial approaches still suffer audio-visual asynchrony, poor lip-speech alignment, and unimodal degradation, which can be stemmed from weak audio-visual correspondence modeling, limited generalization, and scarce high-quality dense-caption data. To address these issues, we introduce Klear and delve into three axes--model architecture, training strategy, and data curation. Architecturally, we adopt a single-tower design with unified DiT blocks and an Omni-Full Attention mechanism, achieving tight audio-visual alignment and strong scalability. Training-wise, we adopt a progressive multitask regime--random modality masking to joint optimization across tasks, and a multistage curriculum, yielding robust representations, strengthening A-V aligned world knowledge, and preventing unimodal collapse. For datasets, we present the first large-scale audio-video dataset with dense captions, and introduce a novel automated data-construction pipeline which annotates and filters millions of diverse, high-quality, strictly aligned audio-video-caption triplets. Building on this, Klear scales to large datasets, delivering high-fidelity, semantically and temporally aligned, instruction-following generation in both joint and unimodal settings while generalizing robustly to out-of-distribution scenarios. Across tasks, it substantially outperforms prior methods by a large margin and achieves performance comparable to Veo 3, offering a unified, scalable path toward next-generation audio-video synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Klear\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u5854\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u4e0d\u540c\u6b65\u3001\u5507\u8bed\u5bf9\u9f50\u5dee\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u9000\u5316\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8054\u5408\u4e0e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1Veo 3\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u975e\u5546\u4e1a\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u4e0d\u540c\u6b65\u3001\u5507\u8bed-\u8bed\u97f3\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u4f73\u548c\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u9000\u5316\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u5f31\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u5e94\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u53ca\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5bc6\u96c6\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u5854\u67b6\u6784\u7ed3\u5408\u7edf\u4e00\u7684DiT\u5757\u4e0e\u5168\u8303\u56f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u968f\u673a\u6a21\u6001\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e26\u5bc6\u96c6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u97f3\u89c6\u9891-\u6587\u672c\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u3002", "result": "Klear\u5728\u8054\u5408\u4e0e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1Veo 3\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "Klear\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Let's OWL make sense of it", "comment": "12 pages, 5 tables, 4 figures", "summary": "The application of machine learning on healthcare data is often hindered by the lack of standardized and semantically explicit representation, leading to limited interoperability and reproducibility across datasets and experiments. The Medical Event Data Standard (MEDS) addresses these issues by introducing a minimal, event-centric data model designed for reproducible machine-learning workflows from health data. However, MEDS is defined as a data-format specification and does not natively provide integration with the Semantic Web ecosystem. In this article, we introduce MEDS-OWL, a lightweight OWL ontology that provides formal concepts and relations to enable representing MEDS datasets as RDF graphs. Additionally, we implemented meds2rdf, a Python conversion library that transforms MEDS events into RDF graphs, ensuring conformance with the ontology. We demonstrate the approach on a synthetic clinical dataset that describes patient care pathways for ruptured intracranial aneurysms and validate the resulting graph using SHACL constraints. The first release of MEDS-OWL comprises 13 classes, 10 object properties, 20 data properties, and 24 OWL axioms. Combined with meds2rdf, it enables data transformation into FAIR-aligned datasets, provenance-aware publishing, and interoperability of event-based clinical data.

As humans cannot interpret thousands of documents, only a small subset of the training data can be presented as an explanation. Although the choice of which documents to include directly affects explanation quality, previous evaluations of such systems have largely ignored any selection strategies. To address this, we propose a novel selection relevance score, a retraining-free metric that quantifies how useful a set of examples is for explaining a model's output. We validate this score through fine-tuning experiments, confirming that it can predict whether a set of examples supports or undermines the model's predictions. Using this metric, we further show that common selection strategies often underperform random selection. Motivated by this finding, we propose a strategy that balances influence and representativeness, enabling better use of selection budgets than naively selecting the highest-ranking examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u4e00\u7ec4\u793a\u4f8b\u5bf9\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6709\u7528\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u8bc4\u5206\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u793a\u4f8b\u96c6\u662f\u5426\u652f\u6301\u6216\u524a\u5f31\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5e38\u89c1\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u5e38\u4e0d\u5982\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5e73\u8861\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9009\u62e9\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5f71\u54cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u6587\u6863\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u4f46\u89e3\u91ca\u65f6\u9700\u4ece\u5927\u91cf\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u9009\u53d6\u5c11\u91cf\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u800c\u4ee5\u5f80\u8bc4\u4f30\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5982\u4f55\u9ad8\u6548\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5177\u89e3\u91ca\u529b\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u7531\u9009\u62e9\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u793a\u4f8b\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u8bc4\u5206\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u793a\u4f8b\u96c6\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u652f\u6301\u6216\u524a\u5f31\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u5e38\u89c1\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u52a3\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\uff1b\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u6709\u9650\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u6709\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5355\u7eaf\u9009\u53d6\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u793a\u4f8b\u5e76\u975e\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u89e3\u91ca\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

Although recent deep models improve robustness compared to classical signal-processing approaches, many methods increase computational cost and parameter count, and attention-based temporal modeling introduces quadratic scaling with respect to the temporal length. This paper proposes ToTMNet, a lightweight rPPG architecture that replaces temporal attention with an FFT-accelerated Toeplitz temporal mixing layer. The Toeplitz operator provides full-sequence temporal receptive field using a linear number of parameters in the clip length and can be applied in near-linear time using circulant embedding and FFT-based convolution. ToTMNet integrates the global Toeplitz temporal operator into a compact gated temporal mixer that combines a local depthwise temporal convolution branch with gated global Toeplitz mixing, enabling efficient long-range temporal filtering while only having 63k parameters. Experiments on two datasets, UBFC-rPPG (real videos) and SCAMPS (synthetic videos), show that ToTMNet achieves strong heart-rate estimation accuracy with a compact design. On UBFC-rPPG intra-dataset evaluation, ToTMNet reaches 1.055 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.996. In a synthetic-to-real setting (SCAMPS to UBFC-rPPG), ToTMNet reaches 1.582 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.994. Ablation results confirm that the gating mechanism is important for effectively using global Toeplitz mixing, especially under domain shift. The main limitation of this preprint study is the use of only two datasets; nevertheless, the results indicate that Toeplitz-structured temporal mixing is a practical and efficient alternative to attention for rPPG.", "AI": {"tldr": "ToTMNet\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7rPPG\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528FFT\u52a0\u901f\u7684Toeplitz\u65f6\u5e8f\u6df7\u5408\u5c42\u66ff\u4ee3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u542b63k\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5728UBFC-rPPG\u548cSCAMPS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5fc3\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6rPPG\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u591a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5b58\u5728\u4e0e\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u5e73\u65b9\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528FFT\u52a0\u901f\u7684Toeplitz\u65f6\u5e8f\u6df7\u5408\u5c42\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u5377\u79ef\u4e0e\u95e8\u63a7\u5168\u5c40Toeplitz\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u95e8\u63a7\u65f6\u5e8f\u6df7\u5408\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5e8f\u5217\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u4e0e\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728UBFC-rPPG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u52301.055 bpm MAE\u548c0.996\u76ae\u5c14\u900a\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\uff1b\u5728SCAMPS\u5230UBFC-rPPG\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u8fc1\u79fb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fbe1.582 bpm MAE\u548c0.994\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u6570\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Toeplitz\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u6df7\u5408\u662f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7rPPG\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002"}}

In this work, we revisit visual localization with a 2D image-based representation and propose to augment each image with estimated depth maps to capture the geometric structure. Supported by the effective use of dense matchers, this representation is not only easy to build and maintain, but achieves highest accuracy in challenging conditions. With compact compression and a GPU-accelerated LO-RANSAC implementation, the whole pipeline is efficient in both storage and computation and allows for a flexible trade-off between accuracy and highest memory efficiency. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy on various standard benchmarks and outperforms existing memory-efficient methods at comparable map sizes.

Revisiting PII Leakage with a Cue-Controlled Memorization Framework", "comment": "20 pages, 13 figures", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been reported to \"leak\" Personally Identifiable Information (PII), with successful PII reconstruction often interpreted as evidence of memorization. We propose a principled revision of memorization evaluation for LLMs, arguing that PII leakage should be evaluated under low lexical cue conditions, where target PII cannot be reconstructed through prompt-induced generalization or pattern completion. We formalize Cue-Resistant Memorization (CRM) as a cue-controlled evaluation framework and a necessary condition for valid memorization evaluation, explicitly conditioning on prompt-target overlap cues. Using CRM, we conduct a large-scale multilingual re-evaluation of PII leakage across 32 languages and multiple memorization paradigms. Revisiting reconstruction-based settings, including verbatim prefix-suffix completion and associative reconstruction, we find that their apparent effectiveness is driven primarily by direct surface-form cues rather than by true memorization. When such cues are controlled for, reconstruction success diminishes substantially. We further examine cue-free generation and membership inference, both of which exhibit extremely low true positive rates. Overall, our results suggest that previously reported PII leakage is better explained by cue-driven behavior than by genuine memorization, highlighting the importance of cue-controlled evaluation for reliably quantifying privacy-relevant memorization in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6027\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u2014\u2014\u6297\u63d0\u793a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6027\uff08CRM\uff09\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u4f4e\u8bcd\u6c47\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2a\u4eba\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f\uff08PII\uff09\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u7531\u63d0\u793a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6216\u6a21\u5f0f\u8865\u5168\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8bef\u5224\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f80\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8868\u9762\u5f62\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff1b\u5f53\u63a7\u5236\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63d0\u793a\u540e\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u6210\u529f\u7387\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u65e0\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u9633\u6027\u7387\u6781\u4f4e\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5148\u524d\u62a5\u544a\u7684PII\u6cc4\u9732\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u7531\u63d0\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e25\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u793a\u7ebf\u7d22\u5bf9\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u79c1\u76f8\u5173\u8bb0\u5fc6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e2a\u4eba\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f\uff08PII\uff09\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u89c6\u4e3a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e38\u53d7\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u8868\u9762\u5f62\u5f0f\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5224\u3002\u4e3a\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6392\u9664\u63d0\u793a\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u6297\u63d0\u793a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6027\uff08CRM\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684PII\u6cc4\u9732\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u76f4\u63a5\u8865\u5168\u3001\u5173\u8054\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u65e0\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u572832\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u793a\u7ebf\u7d22\u540e\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u65e0\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u9633\u6027\u7387\u6781\u4f4e\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u6b64\u524d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684PII\u6cc4\u9732\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5148\u524d\u62a5\u544a\u7684LLM PII\u6cc4\u9732\u66f4\u591a\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7ebf\u7d22\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6240\u81f4\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5fc5\u987b\u91c7\u7528\u7ebf\u7d22\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u624d\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present a universal generative pipeline, CHORD, for CHOReographing Dynamic objects and scenes and synthesizing this type of phenomena. Traditional rule-based graphics pipelines to create these dynamics are based on category-specific heuristics, yet are labor-intensive and not scalable. Recent learning-based methods typically demand large-scale datasets, which may not cover all object categories in interest. Our approach instead inherits the universality from the video generative models by proposing a distillation-based pipeline to extract the rich Lagrangian motion information hidden in the Eulerian representations of 2D videos. Our method is universal, versatile, and category-agnostic.

However, their performance significantly degrades in specialized, culturally specific domains such as Vietnamese Traditional Medicine (VTM), primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality, structured benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce VietMed-MCQ, a novel multiple-choice question dataset generated via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with an automated consistency check mechanism. Unlike previous synthetic datasets, our framework incorporates a dual-model validation approach to ensure reasoning consistency through independent answer verification, though the substring-based evidence checking has known limitations. The complete dataset of 3,190 questions spans three difficulty levels and underwent validation by one medical expert and four students, achieving 94.2 percent approval with substantial inter-rater agreement (Fleiss' kappa = 0.82). We benchmark seven open-source models on VietMed-MCQ. Results reveal that general-purpose models with strong Chinese priors outperform Vietnamese-centric models, highlighting cross-lingual conceptual transfer, while all models still struggle with complex diagnostic reasoning. Our code and dataset are publicly available to foster research in low-resource medical domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7ba1\u9053\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8d8a\u5357\u4f20\u7edf\u533b\u5b66\uff08VTM\uff09\u591a\u9009\u9898\u6570\u636e\u96c6VietMed-MCQ\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b58\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b50\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u68c0\u67e5\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b3,190\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e09\u4e2a\u96be\u5ea6\u7b49\u7ea7\uff0c\u5e76\u7ecf\u7531\u4e00\u540d\u533b\u5b66\u4e13\u5bb6\u548c\u56db\u540d\u5b66\u751f\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6279\u51c6\u7387\u8fbe94.2%\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08Fleiss' kappa = 0.82\uff09\u3002\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u4e2d\u6587\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u8d8a\u5357\u8bed\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6982\u5ff5\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u8bca\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5df2\u516c\u5f00\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u901a\u7528\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8d8a\u5357\u4f20\u7edf\u533b\u5b66\u7b49\u6587\u5316\u7279\u5b9a\u3001\u4e13\u4e1a\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u3002\u4e3a\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u9002\u5408\u672c\u5730\u5316\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7ba1\u9053\u751f\u6210\u591a\u9009\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6a21\u578b\u72ec\u7acb\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u5b50\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5339\u914d\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc1\u636e\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u867d\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u4f46\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6784\u5efa\u7684VietMed-MCQ\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b3,190\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e09\u4e2a\u96be\u5ea6\u5c42\u7ea7\uff0c\u7ecf\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e0e\u5b66\u751f\u5171\u540c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6279\u51c6\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe94.2%\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u826f\u597d\uff08Fleiss' kappa = 0.82\uff09\u3002\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u4e2d\u6587\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u8d8a\u5357\u8bed\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u51fa\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u8bca\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ecd\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "VietMed-MCQ\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8d8a\u5357\u4f20\u7edf\u533b\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u52a8\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u533b\u7597\u8bed\u8a00\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u4ecd\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u503c\u5f97\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u516c\u5f00\uff0c\u5c06\u4fc3\u8fdb\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Wulff"], "title": "Where meaning lives: Layer-wise accessibility of psycholinguistic features in encoder and decoder language models", "comment": null, "summary": "Understanding where transformer language models encode psychologically meaningful aspects of meaning is essential for both theory and practice. We conduct a systematic layer-wise probing study of 58 psycholinguistic features across 10 transformer models, spanning encoder-only and decoder-only architectures, and compare three embedding extraction methods. We find that apparent localization of meaning is strongly method-dependent: contextualized embeddings yield higher feature-specific selectivity and different layer-wise profiles than isolated embeddings. Across models and methods, final-layer representations are rarely optimal for recovering psycholinguistic information with linear probes. Despite these differences, models exhibit a shared depth ordering of meaning dimensions, with lexical properties peaking earlier and experiential and affective dimensions peaking later. Together, these results show that where meaning \"lives\" in transformer models reflects an interaction between methodological choices and architectural constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u9010\u5c42\u63a2\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e8658\u4e2a\u5fc3\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u572810\u79cdTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5d4c\u5165\u6bd4\u5b64\u7acb\u5d4c\u5165\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5c42\u95f4\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u8868\u793a\u5728\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5e76\u975e\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6df1\u5ea6\u6392\u5e8f\uff1a\u8bcd\u6c47\u5c5e\u6027\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5cf0\u503c\uff0c\u800c\u4f53\u9a8c\u6027\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u6027\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5728\u540e\u671f\u5cf0\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3Transformer\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7f16\u7801\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5bf9\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u90fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u5b58\u5728\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u771f\u5b9e\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5bf910\u79cdTransformer\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u9010\u5c42\u63a2\u6d4b\uff0c\u6db5\u76d658\u4e2a\u5fc3\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u5d4c\u5165\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u5b64\u7acb\u5d4c\u5165\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5404\u5c42\u5bf9\u5fc3\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540c\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5c42\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u662f\u6700\u4f73\u9009\u62e9\uff1b\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5171\u4eab\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6df1\u5ea6\u6392\u5e8f\uff1a\u8bcd\u6c47\u5c5e\u6027\u65e9\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u4f53\u9a8c\u6027\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u6027\u7ef4\u5ea6\u665a\u51fa\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49\u5728Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u975e\u56fa\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u7531\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u5171\u540c\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

This paper presents an evaluation of AI text detection methods, including both traditional machine learning models and transformer-based architectures. We utilize two datasets, HC3 and DAIGT v2, to build a unified benchmark and apply a topic-based data split to prevent information leakage. This approach ensures robust generalization across unseen domains. Our experiments show that TF-IDF logistic regression achieves a reasonable baseline accuracy of 82.87%. However, deep learning models outperform it. The BiLSTM classifier achieves an accuracy of 88.86%, while DistilBERT achieves a similar accuracy of 88.11% with the highest ROC-AUC score of 0.96, demonstrating the strongest overall performance. The results indicate that contextual semantic modeling is significantly superior to lexical features and highlight the importance of mitigating topic memorization through appropriate evaluation protocols. The limitations of this work are primarily related to dataset diversity and computational constraints. In future work, we plan to expand dataset diversity and utilize parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA.

While existing approaches improve RLVR via token-level entropy or sequence-level length control, they lack a semantically grounded, step-level measure of reasoning progress. As a result, LLMs fail to distinguish necessary deduction from redundant verification: they may continue checking after reaching a correct solution and, in extreme cases, overturn a correct trajectory into an incorrect final answer. To remedy the lack of process supervision, we introduce a training-free probing mechanism that extracts intermediate confidence and correctness and combines them into a Step Potential signal that explicitly estimates the reasoning state at each step. Building on this signal, we propose Step Potential Advantage Estimation (SPAE), a fine-grained credit assignment method that amplifies potential gains, penalizes potential drops, and applies penalty after potential saturates to encourage timely termination. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show SPAE consistently improves accuracy while substantially reducing response length, outperforming strong RL baselines and recent efficient reasoning and token-level advantage estimation methods.

However, existing pruning methods typically rely on sequential revisions driven by unreliable critique signals, often failing to detect the loss of answer-critical data. To address this limitation, we propose TabTrim, a novel table pruning framework which transforms table pruning from sequential revisions to gold trajectory-supervised parallel search. TabTrim derives a gold pruning trajectory using the intermediate sub-tables in the execution process of gold SQL queries, and trains a pruner and a verifier to make the step-wise pruning result align with the gold pruning trajectory. During inference, TabTrim performs parallel search to explore multiple candidate pruning trajectories and identify the optimal sub-table. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TabTrim achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tabular reasoning tasks: TabTrim-8B reaches 73.5% average accuracy, outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.2%, including 79.4% on WikiTQ and 61.2% on TableBench.", "AI": {"tldr": "TabTrim\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8868\u683c\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u5f0f\u4fee\u6b63\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ec4\u91d1\u8f68\u8ff9\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u9ec4\u91d1SQL\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5b50\u8868\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u526a\u679d\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5e76\u884c\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u4e2a\u526a\u679d\u8def\u5f84\u4ee5\u627e\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u5b50\u8868\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u683c\u95ee\u7b54\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8868\u683c\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6279\u8bc4\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u5e8f\u5217\u5f0f\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5173\u952e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e22\u5931\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "TabTrim\u5229\u7528\u9ec4\u91d1SQL\u67e5\u8be2\u6267\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5b50\u8868\u751f\u6210\u9ec4\u91d1\u526a\u679d\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u526a\u679d\u5668\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u4f7f\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u526a\u679d\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u9ec4\u91d1\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u5e76\u884c\u641c\u7d22\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u4f18\u5b50\u8868\u3002", "result": "TabTrim-8B\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8868\u683c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523073.5%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf3.2%\uff0c\u5728WikiTQ\u4e0a\u8fbe79.4%\uff0c\u5728TableBench\u4e0a\u8fbe61.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "TabTrim\u901a\u8fc7\u9ec4\u91d1\u8f68\u8ff9\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u641c\u7d22\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8868\u683c\u526a\u679d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u8868\u683c\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

These complex narratives pose a significant threat, as hyperpartisanship drives political polarisation and institutional distrust, while PRCTs directly motivate real-world extremist violence, making their identification critical for social cohesion and public safety. However, existing resources are scarce, predominantly English-centric, and often analyse hyperpartisanship, stance, and rhetorical bias in isolation rather than as interrelated aspects of political discourse. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textsc{PartisanLens}, the first multilingual dataset of \\num{1617} hyperpartisan news headlines in Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese, annotated in multiple political discourse aspects. We first evaluate the classification performance of widely used Large Language Models (LLMs) on this dataset, establishing robust baselines for the classification of hyperpartisan and PRCT narratives. In addition, we assess the viability of using LLMs as automatic annotators for this task, analysing their ability to approximate human annotation. Results highlight both their potential and current limitations. Next, moving beyond standard judgments, we explore whether LLMs can emulate human annotation patterns by conditioning them on socio-economic and ideological profiles that simulate annotator perspectives.

We evaluate what matters for safety alignment in LLMs and LRMs to provide essential insights for developing more secure and reliable AI systems. We systematically investigate and compare the influence of six critical intrinsic model characteristics and three external attack techniques. Our large-scale evaluation is conducted using 32 recent, popular LLMs and LRMs across thirteen distinct model families, spanning a parameter scale from 3B to 235B. The assessment leverages five established safety datasets and probes model vulnerabilities with 56 jailbreak techniques and four CoT attack strategies, resulting in 4.6M API calls. Our key empirical findings are fourfold. First, we identify the LRMs GPT-OSS-20B, Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking, and GPT-OSS-120B as the top-three safest models, which substantiates the significant advantage of integrated reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms for robust safety alignment. Second, post-training and knowledge distillation may lead to a systematic degradation of safety alignment. We thus argue that safety must be treated as an explicit constraint or a core optimization objective during these stages, not merely subordinated to the pursuit of general capability. Third, we reveal a pronounced vulnerability: employing a CoT attack via a response prefix can elevate the attack success rate by 3.34x on average and from 0.6% to 96.3% for Seed-OSS-36B-Instruct. This critical finding underscores the safety risks inherent in text-completion interfaces and features that allow user-defined response prefixes in LLM services, highlighting an urgent need for architectural and deployment safeguards. Fourth, roleplay, prompt injection, and gradient-based search for adversarial prompts are the predominant methodologies for eliciting unaligned behaviors in modern models.", "AI": {"tldr":

This paper investigates whether small, decoder-only language models can provide an efficient alternative for the tasks of grammar correction and text simplification. The experiments in this paper focus on testing small language models out of the box, fine-tuned, and run sequentially on the JFLEG and ASSET datasets using established metrics. The results show that while SLMs may learn certain behaviors well, their performance remains below strong baselines and current LLMs. The results also show that SLMs struggle with retaining meaning and hallucinations. These findings suggest that despite their efficiency advantages, current SLMs are not yet competitive enough with modern LLMs for rewriting, and further advances in training are required for SLMs to close the performance gap between them and today's LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5c0f\u578b\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLMs\uff09\u5728\u8bed\u6cd5\u7ea0\u6b63\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7b80\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c3d\u7ba1SLMs\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u8bbf\u95ee\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5728JFLEG\u548cASSET\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u53ca\u987a\u5e8f\u8fd0\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5206\u6790\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u90e8\u5206\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4ecd\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u610f\u548c\u907f\u514d\u5e7b\u89c9\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u5c1a\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5728\u6587\u672c\u91cd\u5199\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u7f29\u5c0f\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose Decide Then Retrieve (DTR), a training-free framework that adaptively determines when retrieval is necessary and how external information should be selected. DTR leverages generation uncertainty to guide retrieval triggering and introduces a dual-path retrieval mechanism with adaptive information selection to better handle sparse and ambiguous queries. Extensive experiments across five open-domain QA benchmarks, multiple model scales, and different retrievers demonstrate that DTR consistently improves EM and F1 over standard RAG and strong retrieval-enhanced baselines, while reducing unnecessary retrievals.

We study how language models implement MCQA internally using representational analyses (PCA, linear probes) as well as causal interventions. We find that option-boundary (newline) residual states often contain strong linearly decodable signals related to per-option correctness. Winner-identity probing reveals a two-stage progression: the winning *content position* becomes decodable immediately after the final option is processed, while the *output symbol* is represented closer to the answer emission position. Tests under symbol and content permutations support a two-stage mechanism in which models first select a winner in content space and then bind or route that winner to the appropriate symbol to emit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u793a\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5982PCA\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\uff09\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u9009\u9898\u95ee\u7b54\uff08MCQA\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u5b9e\u73b0\u673a\u5236\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u9009\u9879\u5206\u9694\u7b26\uff08\u6362\u884c\u7b26\uff09\u5904\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u72b6\u6001\u901a\u5e38\u5305\u542b\u4e0e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9009\u9879\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5f3a\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u89e3\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u8d62\u5bb6\u8eab\u4efd\u63a2\u6d4b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5b8c\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\u9009\u9879\u540e\uff0c\u83b7\u80dc\u5185\u5bb9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7acb\u5373\u53d8\u5f97\u53ef\u89e3\uff0c\u800c\u8f93\u51fa\u7b26\u53f7\u5219\u5728\u7b54\u6848\u751f\u6210\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9644\u8fd1\u88ab\u8868\u793a\u3002\u7b26\u53f7\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u7f6e\u6362\u6d4b\u8bd5\u652f\u6301\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u5728\u5185\u5bb9\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u80dc\u8005\uff0c\u518d\u5c06\u8be5\u80dc\u8005\u7ed1\u5b9a\u6216\u8def\u7531\u5230\u5408\u9002\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u7b26\u53f7\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u9009\u9898\u95ee\u7b54\uff08MCQA\uff09\u867d\u7136\u6613\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f46\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd8\u8981\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee3\u8868\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u63a8\u7406\u9519\u8bef\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u7ed1\u5b9a\u5931\u8d25\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u5185\u90e8\u5b9e\u73b0MCQA\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5185\u5728\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8868\u793a\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5982\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790PCA\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u9009\u9898\u65f6\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u9009\u9879\u8fb9\u754c\u5904\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u72b6\u6001\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u9009\u9879\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u9009\u9879\u5206\u9694\u7b26\uff08\u6362\u884c\u7b26\uff09\u5904\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u89e3\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u5404\u9009\u9879\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u8d62\u5bb6\u8eab\u4efd\u63a2\u6d4b\u663e\u793a\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u5185\u5bb9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u80dc\u8005\u5728\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u9009\u9879\u5904\u7406\u540e\u5373\u88ab\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u800c\u8f93\u51fa\u7b26\u53f7\u5219\u5728\u7b54\u6848\u751f\u6210\u524d\u624d\u88ab\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u7b26\u53f7\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u7f6e\u6362\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5148\u5185\u5bb9\u9009\u62e9\u540e\u7b26\u53f7\u7ed1\u5b9a\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6267\u884c\u591a\u9009\u9898\u95ee\u7b54\u65f6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u5728\u5185\u5bb9\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u5c06\u8be5\u5185\u5bb9\u7ed1\u5b9a\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u7b26\u53f7\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u7b26\u53f7\u7ed1\u5b9a\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While ensuring adherence to these explicit constraints is critical, existing safety research primarily focuses on implicit social norms or text-only settings, overlooking the complexities of multimodal documents. In this paper, we introduce Doc-PP (Document Policy Preservation Benchmark), a novel benchmark constructed from real-world reports requiring reasoning across heterogeneous visual and textual elements under strict non-disclosure policies. Our evaluation highlights a systemic Reasoning-Induced Safety Gap: models frequently leak sensitive information when answers must be inferred through complex synthesis or aggregated across modalities, effectively circumventing existing safety constraints. Furthermore, we identify that providing extracted text improves perception but inadvertently facilitates leakage. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose DVA (Decompose-Verify-Aggregation), a structural inference framework that decouples reasoning from policy verification. Experimental results demonstrate that DVA significantly outperforms standard prompting defenses, offering a robust baseline for policy-compliant document understanding", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDoc-PP\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9075\u5faa\u6587\u6863\u62ab\u9732\u653f\u7b56\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u6cc4\u9732\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u2018\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7f3a\u53e3\u2019\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u63d0\u53d6\u6587\u672c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5374\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faDVA\u6846\u67b6\u2014\u2014\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u805a\u5408\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u653f\u7b56\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u6587\u672c\u6216\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u62ab\u9732\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u9632\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaDoc-PP\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u62a5\u544a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9700\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e14\u53d7\u4e25\u683c\u975e\u62ab\u9732\u653f\u7b56\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u63d0\u51faDVA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u89e3-\u9a8c\u8bc1-\u805a\u5408\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u653f\u7b56\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800cDVA\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6cc4\u6f0f\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u653f\u7b56\u9075\u5b88\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "DVA\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6587\u6863\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u5408\u89c4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dLVLM\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Our approach employs a generator that rewrites real articles with factual perturbations, paired with a lightweight detector that verifies claims using dense passage retrieval. To enable effective co-evolution, we introduce verbal adversarial feedback (VAF). Rather than relying on scalar rewards, VAF issues structured natural-language critiques; these guide the generator toward more sophisticated evasion attempts, compelling the detector to adapt and improve. On a fake news detection benchmark, RADAR achieves 86.98% ROC-AUC, significantly outperforming general-purpose LLMs with retrieval.

Unlike parliamentary proceedings, which typically adhere to standardized formats, they encode voting outcomes in highly heterogeneous, free-form narrative text that varies widely across municipalities, posing significant challenges for automated extraction. In this paper, we introduce VotIE (Voting Information Extraction), a new information extraction task aimed at identifying structured voting events in narrative deliberative records, and establish the first benchmark for this task using Portuguese municipal minutes, building on the recently introduced CitiLink corpus. Our experiments yield two key findings. First, under standard in-domain evaluation, fine-tuned encoders, specifically XLM-R-CRF, achieve the strongest performance, reaching 93.2\\% macro F1, outperforming generative approaches. Second, in a cross-municipality setting that evaluates transfer to unseen administrative contexts, these models suffer substantial performance degradation, whereas few-shot LLMs demonstrate greater robustness, with significantly smaller declines in performance.

However, evaluating the effectiveness of new technology requires real students, which is time-consuming and hard to scale up. Therefore, many recent works on LLM-powered tutoring solutions have used simulated students for both training and evaluation, often via simple prompting. Surprisingly, little work has been done to ensure or even measure the quality of simulated students. In this work, we formally define the student simulation task, propose a set of evaluation metrics that span linguistic, behavioral, and cognitive aspects, and benchmark a wide range of student simulation methods on these metrics. We experiment on a real-world math tutoring dialogue dataset, where both automated and human evaluation results show that prompting strategies for student simulation perform poorly; supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization yield much better but still limited performance, motivating future work on this challenging task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u5b66\u751f\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6559\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u63d0\u793a\uff08prompting\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u6a21\u62df\u5b66\u751f\u5b58\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u6b63\u5f0f\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u62df\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6db5\u76d6\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u5b66\u8f85\u5bfc\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u867d\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u62df\u5b66\u751f\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6a21\u62df\u5b66\u751f\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u969c\u6216\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u62df\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6db5\u76d6\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4f53\u7cfb\uff1b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u5b66\u8f85\u5bfc\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u591a\u79cd\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5747\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5b66\u751f\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u867d\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u4f46\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u62df\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6210\u719f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u8ba4\u77e5\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u62df\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u6280\u672f\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

We present SpeakerSleuth, a benchmark evaluating whether LALMs can reliably judge speaker consistency in multi-turn dialogues through three tasks reflecting real-world requirements. We construct 1,818 human-verified evaluation instances across four diverse datasets spanning synthetic and real speech, with controlled acoustic difficulty. Evaluating nine widely-used LALMs, we find that models struggle to reliably detect acoustic inconsistencies. For instance, given audio samples of the same speaker's turns, some models overpredict inconsistency, whereas others are overly lenient. Models further struggle to identify the exact turns that are problematic. When other interlocutors' turns are provided together, performance degrades dramatically as models prioritize textual coherence over acoustic cues, failing to detect even obvious gender switches for a speaker. On the other hand, models perform substantially better in choosing the audio that best matches the speaker among several acoustic variants, demonstrating inherent acoustic discrimination capabilities. These findings expose a significant bias in LALMs: they tend to prioritize text over acoustics, revealing fundamental modality imbalances that need to be addressed to build reliable audio-language

These challenges are especially pronounced for low-resource languages, where limited parallel data constrains generalization and transfer. Understanding how multilingual models share knowledge across languages requires examining the interaction between representations, data availability, and training strategies. In this thesis, we study cross-lingual knowledge transfer in neural models and develop methods to improve robustness and generalization in multilingual settings, using machine translation as a central testbed. We analyze how similarity between languages influences transfer, how retrieval and auxiliary supervision can strengthen low-resource translation, and how fine-tuning on parallel data can introduce unintended trade-offs in large language models.

To investigate and evaluate the safety impact of MLLMs responses on human behavior in daily life, we introduce SaLAD, a multimodal safety benchmark which contains 2,013 real-world image-text samples across 10 common categories, with a balanced design covering both unsafe scenarios and cases of oversensitivity. It emphasizes realistic risk exposure, authentic visual inputs, and fine-grained cross-modal reasoning, ensuring that safety risks cannot be inferred from text alone. We further propose a safety-warning-based evaluation framework that encourages models to provide clear and informative safety warnings, rather than generic refusals. Results on 18 MLLMs demonstrate that the top-performing models achieve a safe response rate of only 57.2% on unsafe queries. Moreover, even popular safety alignment methods limit effectiveness of the models in our scenario, revealing the vulnerabilities of current MLLMs in identifying dangerous behaviors in daily life.

Henley"], "title": "Modular Prompt Optimization: Optimizing Structured Prompts with Section-Local Textual Gradients", "comment": null, "summary": "Prompt quality plays a central role in controlling the behavior, reliability, and reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly for smaller open-source instruction-tuned models that depend heavily on explicit structure. While recent work has explored automatic prompt optimization using textual gradients and self-refinement, most existing methods treat prompts as monolithic blocks of text, making it difficult to localize errors, preserve critical instructions, or prevent uncontrolled prompt growth. We introduce Modular Prompt Optimization (MPO), a schema-based prompt optimization framework that treats prompts as structured objects composed of fixed semantic sections, including system role, context, task description, constraints, and output format. MPO applies section-local textual gradients, generated by a critic language model, to refine each section independently while keeping the overall prompt schema fixed. Section updates are consolidated through de-duplication to reduce redundancy and interference between components, yielding an interpretable and robust optimization process. We evaluate MPO on two reasoning benchmarks, ARC-Challenge and MMLU, using LLaMA-3 8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct as solver models. Across both benchmarks and models, MPO consistently outperforms an untuned structured prompt and the TextGrad baseline, achieving substantial accuracy gains without modifying model parameters or altering prompt structure. These results demonstrate that maintaining a fixed prompt schema while applying localized, section-wise optimization is an effective and practical approach for improving reasoning performance in small open-source LMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u2014\u2014\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\uff08MPO\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u89c6\u4e3a\u7531\u7cfb\u7edf\u89d2\u8272\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f\u7b49\u56fa\u5b9a\u8bed\u4e49\u90e8\u5206\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5bf9\u8c61\u3002MPO\u901a\u8fc7\u6279\u8bc4\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6587\u672c\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u4f18\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u91cd\u5408\u5e76\u66f4\u65b0\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u7ec4\u4ef6\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u5728ARC-Challenge\u548cMMLU\u4e24\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LLaMA-3 8B-Instruct\u548cMistral-7B-Instruct\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6c42\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cMPO\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u6216\u6539\u53d8\u63d0\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u672a\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u548cTextGrad\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5f00\u6e90\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u89c6\u4e3a\u6574\u4f53\u6587\u672c\u5757\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9519\u8bef\u3001\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u6307\u4ee4\u6216\u9632\u6b62\u63d0\u793a\u65e0\u5e8f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u5f00\u6e90\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\uff08MPO\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u56fa\u5b9a\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5982\u7cfb\u7edf\u89d2\u8272\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6279\u8bc4\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5404\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6587\u672c\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u4f18\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u91cd\u5408\u5e76\u66f4\u65b0\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u6574\u4f53\u63d0\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u5728ARC-Challenge\u548cMMLU\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMPO\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLaMA-3 8B-Instruct\u548cMistral-7B-Instruct\uff09\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u672a\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u548cTextGrad\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u6216\u6539\u53d8\u63d0\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ef4\u6301\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u7684\u3001\u5206\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u578b\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While Masked Language Models (MLMs) offer efficient bidirectional context, they traditionally lack the generative fidelity of autoregressive models and the semantic continuity of diffusion models. Furthermore, extending masked generation to multimodal settings introduces severe alignment challenges and training instability. In this work, we propose \\textbf{CoM-DAD} (\\textbf{Co}upled \\textbf{M}anifold \\textbf{D}iscrete \\textbf{A}bsorbing \\textbf{D}iffusion), a novel probabilistic framework that reformulates multimodal generation as a hierarchical dual-process. CoM-DAD decouples high-level semantic planning from low-level token synthesis. First, we model the semantic manifold via a continuous latent diffusion process; second, we treat token generation as a discrete absorbing diffusion process, regulated by a \\textbf{Variable-Rate Noise Schedule}, conditioned on these evolving semantic priors. Crucially, we introduce a \\textbf{Stochastic Mixed-Modal Transport} strategy that aligns disparate modalities without requiring heavy contrastive dual-encoders.

Our method extends a chain-style knowledge distillation approach by incorporating a programmable module that guides knowledge graph exploration. This module is embedded as executable code within the reasoning prompt, allowing the model to leverage external structured knowledge during inference. Based on this design, we develop an enhanced distillation-based reasoning framework that explicitly regulates intermediate reasoning steps, resulting in more reliable predictions. We evaluate the proposed approach on multiple public benchmarks using GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.3. Experimental results show that code-guided reasoning significantly improves contextual modeling and reduces prompt-induced hallucinations. Specifically, HIT@1, HIT@3, and HIT@5 increase by 15.64%, 13.38%, and 13.28%, respectively, with scores exceeding 95% across several evaluation settings.

While positional bias has been studied in various contexts, from attention sinks to task performance degradation in long-context settings, prior work has not established how these biases evolve across individual layers and input positions, or how they vary independent of task complexity. We introduce an attribution-based framework to analyze positional effects in short-context language modeling. Using layer conductance with a sliding-window approach, we quantify how each layer distributes importance across input positions, yielding layer-wise positional importance profiles. We find that these profiles are architecture-specific, stable across inputs, and invariant to lexical scrambling. Characterizing these profiles, we find prominent recency bias that increases with depth and subtle primacy bias that diminishes through model depth. Beyond positional structure, we also show that early layers preferentially weight content words over function words across all positions, while later layers lose this word-type differentiation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u5bfc\u6570\u4e0e\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cf\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5404\u5c42\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u501a\u5177\u6709\u67b6\u6784\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3001\u8de8\u8f93\u5165\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u5bf9\u8bcd\u6c47\u6253\u4e71\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u968f\u6df1\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u663e\u8457\u8fd1\u671f\u6027\u504f\u501a\u548c\u968f\u6df1\u5ea6\u51cf\u5f31\u7684\u8f7b\u5fae\u9996\u8981\u6027\u504f\u501a\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u5185\u5bb9\u8bcd\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u5c42\u5219\u5931\u53bb\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bcd\u6027\u533a\u5206\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u867d\u5173\u6ce8\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u501a\u5728\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9677\u9631\u548c\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u504f\u501a\u5728\u5404\u5c42\u53ca\u8f93\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0a\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5c42\u5bfc\u6570\u7ed3\u5408\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u4e0d\u540c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9010\u5c42\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8f6e\u5ed3\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4d\u7f6e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8f6e\u5ed3\u5177\u6709\u67b6\u6784\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b\u5b58\u5728\u968f\u6df1\u5ea6\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u8fd1\u671f\u6027\u504f\u501a\u548c\u968f\u6df1\u5ea6\u51cf\u5f31\u7684\u9996\u8981\u6027\u504f\u501a\uff1b\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u504f\u597d\u5185\u5bb9\u8bcd\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u5c42\u5219\u4e27\u5931\u6b64\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u501a\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u5206\u5e03\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d7\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u8bcd\u6027\u7c7b\u578b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u968f\u5c42\u7ea7\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u6539\u53d8\u3002"}}

As world knowledge evolves, effective deployment increasingly depends on their ability to faithfully follow externally retrieved context. When such evidence conflicts with the model's internal knowledge, LLMs often default to memorized facts, producing unfaithful outputs. In this work, we introduce ContextFocus, a lightweight activation steering approach that improves context faithfulness in such knowledge-conflict settings while preserving fluency and efficiency. Unlike prior approaches, our solution requires no model finetuning and incurs minimal inference-time overhead, making it highly efficient. We evaluate ContextFocus on the ConFiQA benchmark, comparing it against strong baselines including ContextDPO, COIECD, and prompting-based methods.

RFC Bench operates at the paragraph level and captures the contextual complexity of financial news where meaning emerges from dispersed cues. The benchmark defines two complementary tasks: reference free misinformation detection and comparison based diagnosis using paired original perturbed inputs. Experiments reveal a consistent pattern: performance is substantially stronger when comparative context is available, while reference free settings expose significant weaknesses, including unstable predictions and elevated invalid outputs. These results indicate that current models struggle to maintain coherent belief states without external grounding. By highlighting this gap, RFC Bench provides a structured testbed for studying reference free reasoning and advancing more reliable financial misinformation detection in real world settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "RFC Bench \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u91d1\u878d\u65b0\u95fb\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u91d1\u878d\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u6bb5\u843d\u7ea7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u914d\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bca\u65ad\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5219\u66b4\u9732\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u65e0\u6548\u8f93\u51fa\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5916\u90e8\u652f\u6491\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u8fde\u8d2f\u4fe1\u5ff5\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e0\u53c2\u7167\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5f3a\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5916\u90e8\u652f\u6491\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u4fe1\u5ff5\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u65b0\u95fb\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa RFC Bench \u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6bb5\u843d\u7ea7\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b64\u7acb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u5224\u65ad\u771f\u4f2a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u6bd4\u8f83\u578b\u8bca\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u59cb\u4e0e\u6270\u52a8\u7248\u672c\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e24\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff1b\u800c\u5728\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u51fa\u73b0\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u8f93\u51fa\u65e0\u6548\u7b49\u4e25\u91cd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u51fa\u5176\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5916\u90e8\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6301\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8584\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5916\u90e8\u63a5\u5730\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002RFC Bench \u6709\u6548\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}
