Despite their advances, these systems remain vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce PHANTOM (PHysical ANamorphic Threats Obstructing connected vehicle Mobility), a novel framework for crafting and deploying perspective-dependent adversarial examples using \\textit{anamorphic art}. PHANTOM exploits geometric distortions that appear natural to humans but are misclassified with high confidence by state-of-the-art object detectors. Unlike conventional attacks, PHANTOM operates in black-box settings without model access and demonstrates strong transferability across four diverse detector architectures (YOLOv5, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet).

In a non-robust setting, the ``gold standard'' scoring function, known as the geometric error, follows from a probabilistic model with Gaussian noises. We extend it to spherical noises. In a robust setting, we consider a mixture with uniformly distributed outliers and show that a threshold-based parameterization leads to a unified view of likelihood-based and robust M-estimators and associated local optimization schemes.\n  Next we analyze MAGSAC++ which stands out for two reasons. First, it achieves the best results according to existing benchmarks. Second, it makes quite different modeling assumptions and derivation steps. We discovered, however that the derivation does not correspond to sound principles and the resulting score function is in fact numerically equivalent to a simple Gaussian-uniform likelihood, a basic model within the proposed framework.\n  Finally, we propose an experimental methodology for evaluating scoring functions: assuming either a large validation set, or a small random validation set in expectation. We find that all scoring functions, including using a learned inlier distribution, perform identically. In particular, MAGSAC++ score is found to be neither better performing than simple contenders nor less sensitive to the choice of the threshold hyperparameter.\n  Our theoretical and experimental analysis thus comprehensively revisit the state-of-the-art, which is critical for any future research seeking to improve the methods or apply them to other robust fitting problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e86\u5728RANSAC\u4e2d\u4e3a\u5019\u9009\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u914d\u8bc4\u5206\uff08\u62df\u5408\u8d28\u91cf\uff09\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7403\u9762\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u8bef\u5dee\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2M-\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u53ca\u5176\u5c40\u90e8\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0MAGSAC++\u7684\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e0d\u9075\u5faa\u4e25\u8c28\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5176\u5f97\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u6570\u503c\u4e0a\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u9ad8\u65af-\u5747\u5300\u4f3c\u7136\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f7f\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5185\u70b9\u5206\u5e03\uff0cMAGSAC++\u5e76\u672a\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5bf9\u9608\u503c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u66f4\u4f4e\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982MAGSAC++\u7684\u63a8\u5bfc\u57fa\u7840\u5b58\u7591\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u4f18\u52bf\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u8bc1\u5b9e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u51e0\u4f55\u8bef\u5dee\u81f3\u7403\u9762\u566a\u58f0\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u7edf\u4e00\u4f3c\u7136\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u5bf9MAGSAC++\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u6eaf\u6e90\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u6216\u5c0f\u968f\u673a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u7684\u671f\u671b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "MAGSAC++\u7684\u5f97\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u6570\u503c\u4e0a\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u9ad8\u65af-\u5747\u5300\u4f3c\u7136\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u7b80\u5355\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u5176\u4f18\u52a3\uff0c\u4e14\u9608\u503c\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5982MAGSAC++\uff09\u5e76\u65e0\u7406\u8bba\u6216\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e0a\u7684\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e94\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u5176\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u7406\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u9c81\u68d2\u51e0\u4f55\u62df\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

To overcome these limitations, we introduce HyGE-Occ, a novel framework that leverages a hybrid view-transformation branch with 3D Gaussian and edge priors to enhance both geometric consistency and boundary awareness in 3D panoptic occupancy prediction.

While prior work has investigated how models can be adapted or optimized for specific tasks, far less is known about how well LLMs perform at interpreting authentic educational scenarios without significant customization. As LLM-based systems become widely adopted by learners and educators in everyday academic contexts, understanding their out-of-the-box capabilities is increasingly important for setting expectations and benchmarking. We compared six LLMs to estimate their baseline performance on a simple but important task: classifying instructional moves in authentic classroom transcripts. We evaluated typical prompting methods: zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting. We found that while zero-shot performance was moderate, providing comprehensive examples (few-shot prompting) significantly improved performance for state-of-the-art models, with the strongest configuration reaching Cohen's Kappa = 0.58 against expert-coded annotations. At the same time, improvements were neither uniform nor complete: performance varied considerably by instructional move, and higher recall frequently came at the cost of increased false positives. Overall, these findings indicate that foundation models demonstrate meaningful yet limited capacity to interpret instructional discourse, with prompt design helping to surface capability but not eliminating fundamental reliability constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u516d\u79cd\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u8bfe\u5802\u8f6c\u5f55\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u5355\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u914d\u7f6e\u8fbe\u5230Cohen's Kappa = 0.58\uff0c\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6559\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u4e14\u9ad8\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u5e38\u4f34\u968f\u66f4\u591a\u8bef\u62a5\u3002\u603b\u4f53\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u4e00\u5b9a\u89e3\u8bfb\u6559\u5b66\u8bdd\u8bed\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u6d88\u9664\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u5728\u672a\u7ecf\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u80fd\u529b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bbe\u5b9a\u5408\u7406\u9884\u671f\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u516d\u79cdLLMs\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8bfe\u5802\u8f6c\u5f55\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6559\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u5355\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6700\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230Cohen's Kappa = 0.58\uff1b\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6559\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u9ad8\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u5e38\u4f34\u968f\u9ad8\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u8bdd\u8bed\u89e3\u8bfb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1b\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u90e8\u5206\u91ca\u653e\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u514b\u670d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Gutjahr"], "title": "A Branch-and-Price Algorithm for Fast and Equitable Last-Mile Relief Aid Distribution", "comment": null, "summary": "The distribution of relief supplies to shelters is a critical aspect of post-disaster humanitarian logistics. In major disasters, prepositioned supplies often fall short of meeting all demands. We address the problem of planning vehicle routes from a distribution center to shelters while allocating limited relief supplies. To balance efficiency and equity, we formulate a bi-objective problem: minimizing a Gini-index-based measure of inequity in unsatisfied demand for fair distribution and minimizing total travel time for timely delivery. We propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and use the $\u03b5$-constraint method to handle the bi-objective nature. By deriving mathematical properties of the optimal solution, we introduce valid inequalities and design an algorithm for optimal delivery allocations given feasible vehicle routes. A branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently. Computational tests on realistic datasets from a past earthquake in Van, Turkey, and predicted data for Istanbul's Kartal region show that the B&P algorithm significantly outperforms commercial MIP solvers. Our bi-objective approach reduces aid distribution inequity by 34% without compromising efficiency. Results indicate that when time constraints are very loose or tight, lexicographic optimization prioritizing demand coverage over fairness is effective.

While fully supervised techniques achieve high accuracy, they demand extensive labeled datasets that are costly to obtain. Conversely, unsupervised methods eliminate labeling needs but often deliver suboptimal performance. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation across the supervision spectrum for wearable-based HAR, with particular focus on novel approaches that minimize labeling requirements while maintaining competitive accuracy. We develop and empirically compare: (1) traditional fully supervised learning, (2) basic unsupervised learning, (3) a weakly supervised learning approach with constraints, (4) a multi-task learning approach with knowledge sharing, (5) a self-supervised approach based on domain expertise, and (6) a novel weakly self-supervised learning framework that leverages domain knowledge and minimal labeled data. Experiments across benchmark datasets demonstrate that: (i) our weakly supervised methods achieve performance comparable to fully supervised approaches while significantly reducing supervision requirements; (ii) the proposed multi-task framework enhances performance through knowledge sharing between related tasks; (iii) our weakly self-supervised approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency with just 10\\% of labeled data.

Prior work focuses largely on web pages and mobile screens, leaving app widgets underexplored. Unlike web or mobile UIs with rich hierarchical context, widgets are compact, context-free micro-interfaces that summarize key information through dense layouts and iconography under strict spatial constraints. Moreover, while (image, code) pairs are widely available for web or mobile UIs, widget designs are proprietary and lack accessible markup. We formalize this setting as the Widget-to-Code (Widget2Code) and introduce an image-only widget benchmark with fine-grained, multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. Benchmarking shows that although generalized multimodal large language models (MLLMs) outperform specialized UI2Code methods, they still produce unreliable and visually inconsistent code. To address these limitations, we develop a baseline that jointly advances perceptual understanding and structured code generation. At the perceptual level, we follow widget design principles to assemble atomic components into complete layouts, equipped with icon retrieval and reusable visualization modules. At the system level, we design an end-to-end infrastructure, WidgetFactory, which includes a framework-agnostic widget-tailored domain-specific language (WidgetDSL) and a compiler that translates it into multiple front-end implementations (e.g., React, HTML/CSS). An adaptive rendering module further refines spatial dimensions to satisfy compactness constraints. Together, these contributions substantially enhance visual fidelity, establishing a strong baseline and unified infrastructure for future Widget2Code research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faWidget2Code\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5e94\u7528\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u901a\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e13\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faWidgetFactory\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9075\u5faa\u754c\u9762\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u5757\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u56fe\u6807\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u7684WidgetDSL\u53ca\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u524d\u7aef\u5b9e\u73b0\uff08\u5982React\u3001HTML/CSS\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6e32\u67d3\u4f18\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709UI2Code\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u7f51\u9875\u548c\u79fb\u52a8\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u800c\u5e94\u7528\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08widgets\uff09\u56e0\u5176\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u5e03\u5c40\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e14\u53d7\u7a7a\u95f4\u9650\u5236\u7684\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u901a\u5e38\u4e3a\u4e13\u6709\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9widget\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faWidgetFactory\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u4f9d\u636e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u5b50\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7ec4\u5408\u6784\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u56fe\u6807\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00WidgetDSL\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u5c06DSL\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u591a\u79cd\u524d\u7aef\u5b9e\u73b0\uff08\u5982React\u3001HTML/CSS\uff09\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6e32\u67d3\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e03\u5c40\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89c4\u8303\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u901a\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u800c\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86Widget2Code\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u517c\u5177\u611f\u77e5\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bdWidgetFactory\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u5728\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u5fae\u754c\u9762\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\u4e0e\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Because bold language can stem from either strong empirical results or mere rhetorical style, it is often difficult to distinguish between the two. To disentangle rhetorical style from substantive content, we introduce a counterfactual, LLM-based framework: multiple LLM rhetorical personas generate counterfactual writings from the same substantive content, an LLM judge compares them through pairwise evaluations, and the outcomes are aggregated using a Bradley--Terry model. Applying this method to 8,485 ICLR submissions sampled from 2017 to 2025, we generate more than 250,000 counterfactual writings and provide a large-scale quantification of rhetorical style in ML papers. We find that visionary framing significantly predicts downstream attention, including citations and media attention, even after controlling for peer-review evaluations.

While LLMs do not possess a human psychology, they often can emulate human behaviors with sufficiently high fidelity to drive simulations to test human behavioral hypotheses, exhibiting more nuance and range than the rule-based agents often employed in behavioral economics. One key area of interest is the effect of personality on decision making, but the requirement that a prompt must be created for every tested personality profile introduces experimental overhead and degrades replicability. To address this issue, we leverage interpolative decoding, representing each dimension of personality as a pair of opposed prompts and employing an interpolation parameter to simulate behavior along the dimension. We show that interpolative decoding reliably modulates scores along each of the Big Five dimensions. We then show how interpolative decoding causes LLMs to mimic human decision-making behavior in economic games, replicating results from human psychological research. Finally, we present preliminary results of our efforts to ``twin'' individual human players in a collaborative game through systematic search for points in interpolation space that cause the system to replicate actions taken by the human subject.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u63d2\u503c\u89e3\u7801\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u5bf9\u5bf9\u7acb\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u63d2\u503c\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u683c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u8c03\u8282\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e94\u5927\u6027\u683c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7ecf\u6d4e\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u590d\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u5fc3\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7\u641c\u7d22\u63d2\u503c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u2018\u5b6a\u751f\u2019\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7c7b\u73a9\u5bb6\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6027\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5355\u72ec\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u590d\u73b0\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4eba\u683c\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u63d2\u503c\u89e3\u7801\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u683c\u7684\u6bcf\u4e00\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u4e00\u5bf9\u5bf9\u7acb\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u63d2\u503c\u53c2\u6570\u5728\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u63d2\u503c\u89e3\u7801\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u8c03\u8282\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e94\u5927\u6027\u683c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u5f97\u5206\uff1b\u5728\u7ecf\u6d4e\u535a\u5f08\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u521d\u6b65\u6210\u529f\u901a\u8fc7\u641c\u7d22\u63d2\u503c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5339\u914d\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7c7b\u73a9\u5bb6\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d2\u503c\u89e3\u7801\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u683c\u5bf9\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u6f5c\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2a\u4f53\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u5efa\u6a21\u3002"}}

ICFA reuses an available proposal sampler and a task-specific similarity function to form a focused sampling distribution, while adaptively controlling focusing strength to avoid degeneracy. We provide a clear recipe, a stability diagnostic based on effective sample size, a compact theoretical sketch explaining when ICFA can reduce sample needs, and two reproducible experiments: constrained language generation and sparse-reward navigation. We further show how structured prompts instantiate an approximate, language-level form of ICFA and describe a hybrid architecture combining prompted inference with algorithmic reweighting.", "AI": {"tldr": "ICFA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5019\u9009\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7a00\u6709\u4f46\u6709\u7528\u89e3\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u5b9e\u73b0\u805a\u7126\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5df2\u6709\u63d0\u8bae\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u5f62\u6210\u805a\u7126\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u805a\u7126\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u9000\u5316\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5357\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e24\u4e2a\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1a\u53d7\u9650\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u5bfc\u822a\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bed\u8a00\u5c42\u9762\u7684ICFA\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u63d0\u793a\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4ece\u5de8\u5927\u5019\u9009\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u627e\u5230\u7a00\u6709\u4f46\u6709\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e38\u89c1\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6216\u590d\u6742\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u6765\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u8d28\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\"\u9006\u56e0\u679c\u805a\u7126\u7b97\u6cd5\"\uff08ICFA\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u641c\u7d22\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cd\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u8bae\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u805a\u7126\u91c7\u6837\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u76d1\u63a7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u8282\u805a\u7126\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u5206\u5e03\u9000\u5316\u3002", "result": "ICFA\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff1a\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6240\u9700\u6837\u672c\u6570\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u6837\u672c\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5b9e\u73b0ICFA\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ICFA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u7f3a\u6216\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e9e\u5927\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u5176\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u4e5f\u4e3a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

While their responses often sound fluent and natural, they can also carry subtle tone biases such as sounding overly polite, cheerful, or cautious even when neutrality is expected. These tendencies can influence how users perceive trust, empathy, and fairness in dialogue. In this study, we explore tone bias as a hidden behavioral trait of large language models. The novelty of this research lies in the integration of controllable large language model based dialogue synthesis with tone classification models, enabling robust and ethical emotion recognition in personal assistant interactions. We created two synthetic dialogue datasets, one generated from neutral prompts and another explicitly guided to produce positive or negative tones. Surprisingly, even the neutral set showed consistent tonal skew, suggesting that bias may stem from the model's underlying conversational style. Using weak supervision through a pretrained DistilBERT model, we labeled tones and trained several classifiers to detect these patterns. Ensemble models achieved macro F1 scores up to 0.92, showing that tone bias is systematic, measurable, and relevant to designing fair and trustworthy conversational AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9690\u542b\u7684\u8bed\u6c14\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8bed\u6c14\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e24\u7c7b\u5408\u6210\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u4e2d\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u503e\u5411\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4e2d\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bed\u6c14\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u5229\u7528\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u7684DistilBERT\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u9ad80.92\u7684\u5b8fF1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8bed\u6c14\u504f\u89c1\u662f\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e14\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9\u8bddAI\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u867d\u8868\u73b0\u6d41\u7545\u81ea\u7136\uff0c\u4f46\u5e38\u5e26\u6709\u8fc7\u5ea6\u793c\u8c8c\u3001\u4e50\u89c2\u6216\u8c28\u614e\u7b49\u8bed\u6c14\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u4fe1\u4efb\u3001\u5171\u60c5\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u6b64\u7c7b\u9690\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u63a7\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684DistilBERT\u8bed\u6c14\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u7ec4\u5408\u6210\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u4e2d\u6027\u4e0e\u6b63/\u8d1f\u5411\u5f15\u5bfc\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u5f0f\u6807\u6ce8\u8bed\u6c14\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u4f7f\u7528\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u6c14\u504f\u5dee\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5373\u4fbf\u5728\u4e2d\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ecd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8bed\u6c14\u504f\u5411\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u9ad80.92\u7684\u5b8fF1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8bed\u6c14\u504f\u89c1\u5177\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5bf9\u8bddAI\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u6c14\u504f\u89c1\u662f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5176\u6839\u6e90\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u98ce\u683c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u8be5\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

In that sense, depending on its intensity, intra-class variability can hinder the learning process for DL models, specially when such classes are also underrepresented, which is a very common scenario in Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) tasks. This paper proposes a novel method that aims at leveraging classification performance in FGVC tasks by learning fine-grained features via classification of class-wise cluster assignments. Our goal is to apply clustering over each class individually, which can allow to discover pseudo-labels that encodes a latent degree of similarity between images. In turn, those labels can be employed in a hierarchical classification process that allows to learn more fine-grained visual features and thereby mitigating intra-class variability issues. Initial experiments over the PlantNet300k enabled to shed light upon several key points in which future work will have to be developed in order to find more conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of our method. Our method still achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PlantNet300k dataset even though some of its components haven't been shown to be fully optimized.

Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \\ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent computational cost. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5757\u5faa\u73af\u5047\u8bbe\uff08BRH\uff09\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u538b\u5668\uff08ViT\uff09\u5177\u6709\u5757\u5faa\u73af\u6df1\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5373\u539f\u59cbL\u4e2a\u5757\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u7531\u5c11\u91cf\uff08k\u226aL\uff09\u4e0d\u540c\u5757\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u5e94\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u6784\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u5757\u5faa\u73af\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578bRaptor\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7b49\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86DINOv2 ImageNet-1k\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b96%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5730\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5047\u8bbe\u53d1\u5c55\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7c7b\u522b\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u89d2\u57fa\u5e95\u6536\u655b\u3001\u4ee4\u724c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53ca\u540e\u671f\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f4e\u79e9\u66f4\u65b0\u7b49\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8868\u660eViT\u6df1\u5c42\u5b58\u5728\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5176\u901a\u8fc7\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u538b\u5668\uff08ViT\uff09\u6df1\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5176\u67b6\u6784\u6697\u793a\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u65e0\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u6df1\u5ea6\u89c6\u4e3a\u53ef\u523b\u753b\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u89e3\u91caViT\u6df1\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u672c\u8d28\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5757\u5faa\u73af\u5047\u8bbe\uff08BRH\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8de8\u5c42\u8868\u793a\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u77e9\u9635\u8bc6\u522b\u8fde\u7eed\u9636\u6bb5\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u5757\u5faa\u73af\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578bRaptor\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5757\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e2d\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u65b9\u5411\u6536\u655b\u3001\u4ee4\u724c\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u66f4\u65b0\u79e9\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u6784\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9Raptor\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u62df\u5408\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u6210\u529f\u8bad\u7ec3\u51fa\u4ec5\u75282\u4e2a\u5757\u5373\u53ef\u6062\u590dDINOv2 ImageNet-1k 96%\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684Raptor\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86BRH\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u7c7b\u95f4\u65b9\u5411\u6536\u655b\u3001\u4ee4\u724c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u53ca\u665a\u671f\u4f4e\u79e9\u66f4\u65b0\u7b49\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7d27\u51d1\u5faa\u73af\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u5757\u5faa\u73af\u8ba1\u7b97\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u8fd9\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u89e3\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5185\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We adopt Schoenfeld's Episode Theory as an inductive, intermediate-scale lens and introduce ThinkARM (Anatomy of Reasoning in Models), a scalable framework that explicitly abstracts reasoning traces into functional reasoning steps such as Analysis, Explore, Implement, Verify, etc. When applied to mathematical problem solving by diverse models, this abstraction reveals reproducible thinking dynamics and structural differences between reasoning and non-reasoning models, which are not apparent from token-level views. We further present two diagnostic case studies showing that exploration functions as a critical branching step associated with correctness, and that efficiency-oriented methods selectively suppress evaluative feedback steps rather than uniformly shortening responses. Together, our results demonstrate that episode-level representations make reasoning steps explicit, enabling systematic analysis of how reasoning is structured, stabilized, and altered in modern language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faThinkARM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eSchoenfeld\u7684\u5267\u96c6\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u62bd\u8c61\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u5b9e\u65bd\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b49\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u601d\u7ef4\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\u5728\u8bcd\u5143\u5c42\u9762\u65e0\u6cd5\u5bdf\u89c9\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u8bca\u65ad\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5206\u652f\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u800c\u6548\u7387\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u6291\u5236\u8bc4\u4f30\u53cd\u9988\u6b65\u9aa4\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u7f29\u77ed\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5267\u96c6\u7ea7\u8868\u793a\u4f7f\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u663e\u5f0f\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53d8\u5316\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u66b4\u9732\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6df1\u5c42\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6b65\u9aa4\u4ecd\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8bcd\u5143\u5c42\u9762\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u672c\u8d28\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u63a8\u7406\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Schoenfeld\u7684\u5267\u96c6\u7406\u8bba\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f52\u7eb3\u6027\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u6784\u5efaThinkARM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u62bd\u8c61\u4e3a\u5982\u5206\u6790\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u5b9e\u65bd\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b49\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u62bd\u8c61\u540e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u53ef\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5206\u652f\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1b\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u6291\u5236\u8bc4\u4f30\u53cd\u9988\u6b65\u9aa4\u800c\u975e\u7edf\u4e00\u538b\u7f29\u54cd\u5e94\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "episode-level\uff08\u5267\u96c6\u7ea7\uff09\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u591f\u4f7f\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u663e\u5f0f\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, existing evaluations fail to address this integration, as they are limited to either disembodied social reasoning (e.g., in text) or socially-agnostic physical tasks. Both approaches fail to assess an agent's ability to integrate and trade off both physical and social constraints within a realistic, embodied context. To address this challenge, we introduce Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test (S$^{3}$IT), a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate embodied social intelligence. It is centered on a novel and challenging seat-ordering task, requiring an agent to arrange seating in a 3D environment for a group of large language model-driven (LLM-driven) NPCs with diverse identities, preferences, and intricate interpersonal relationships. Our procedurally extensible framework generates a vast and diverse scenario space with controllable difficulty, compelling the agent to acquire preferences through active dialogue, perceive the environment via autonomous exploration, and perform multi-objective optimization within a complex constraint network. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on S$^{3}$IT and found that they still struggle with this problem, showing an obvious gap compared with the human baseline. Results imply that LLMs have deficiencies in spatial intelligence, yet simultaneously demonstrate their ability to achieve near human-level competence in resolving conflicts that possess explicit textual cues.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faS$^{3}$IT\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u5177\u8eab\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6574\u5408\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5ea7\u4f4d\u5b89\u6392\u4efb\u52a1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u4e3b\u52a8\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u975e\u5177\u8eab\u793e\u4ea4\u63a8\u7406\u6216\u5ffd\u7565\u793e\u4f1a\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u8861\u91cf\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5177\u8eab\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u534f\u8c03\u7269\u7406\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1S$^{3}$IT\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7531\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684NPC\u7ec4\u6210\u76843D\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5ea7\u4f4d\u5b89\u6392\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u521b\u5efa\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4e14\u53ef\u8c03\u63a7\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u5bf9\u8bdd\u83b7\u53d6\u504f\u597d\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u63a2\u7d22\u73af\u5883\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u57fa\u7ebf\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u51fa\u5176\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u660e\u786e\u6587\u672c\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u89e3\u51b3\u4ecd\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "S$^{3}$IT\u6709\u6548\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5177\u8eab\u793e\u4f1a\u667a\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u53d1\u5c55\u878d\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing methods often produce implausible results in both equirectangular projections (ERP) and perspective views. To address these limitations, we propose SE360, a novel framework for multi-condition guided object editing in 360$^\\circ$ panoramas. At its core is a novel coarse-to-fine autonomous data generation pipeline without manual intervention. This pipeline leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and adaptive projection adjustment for hierarchical analysis, ensuring the holistic segmentation of objects and their physical context. The resulting data pairs are both semantically meaningful and geometrically consistent, even when sourced from unlabeled panoramas.

Both pursuits require knowledge of the underlying symmetries in data. To address this, we propose learning symmetries directly from data via flow matching on Lie groups. We formulate symmetry discovery as learning a distribution over a larger hypothesis group, such that the learned distribution matches the symmetries observed in data. Relative to previous works, our method, \\lieflow, is more flexible in terms of the types of groups it can discover and requires fewer assumptions. Experiments on 2D and 3D point clouds demonstrate the successful discovery of discrete groups, including reflections by flow matching over the complex domain.

Since fine-tuned weights differ from their base model by relatively small structured residuals, a natural approach is to represent them as compressed deltas. We propose a simple 1-bit delta scheme that stores only the sign of the weight difference together with lightweight per-axis (row/column) FP16 scaling factors, learned from a small calibration set. This design preserves the compactness of 1-bit deltas while more accurately capturing variation across weight dimensions, leading to improved reconstruction quality over scalar alternatives. From a systems perspective, a streamlined loader that transfers packed deltas in a single operation per module reduces cold-start latency and storage overhead, with artifacts several times smaller than a full FP16 checkpoint.

After training on large video data, will global 3D understanding naturally emerge? We study this by quantifying the 3D understanding of existing Video Foundation Models (VidFMs) pretrained on vast video data. We propose the first model-agnostic framework that measures the 3D awareness of various VidFMs by estimating multiple 3D properties from their features via shallow read-outs. Our study presents meaningful findings regarding the 3D awareness of VidFMs on multiple axes. In particular, we show that state-of-the-art video generation models exhibit a strong understanding of 3D objects and scenes, despite not being trained on any 3D data. Such understanding can even surpass that of large expert models specifically trained for 3D tasks.

While existing video generative models produce impressive visual predictions, they are difficult to translate into low-level actions. Conversely, latent-action models better align videos with actions, but they typically operate at the single-step level and lack high-level planning capabilities. We bridge this gap by introducing Skill Abstraction from Optical Flow (SOF), a framework that learns latent skills from large collections of action-free videos. Our key idea is to learn a latent skill space through an intermediate representation based on optical flow that captures motion information aligned with both video dynamics and robot actions. By learning skills in this flow-based latent space, SOF enables high-level planning over video-derived skills and allows for easier translation of these skills into actions. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves performance in both multitask and long-horizon settings, demonstrating the ability to acquire and compose skills directly from raw visual data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u6d41\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u62bd\u8c61\uff08SOF\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u65e0\u52a8\u4f5c\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u5728\u6280\u80fd\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5149\u6d41\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u6765\u6355\u6349\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9ad8\u9636\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4f4e\u5c42\u52a8\u4f5c\uff1b\u800c\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u5355\u6b65\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u9636\u89c4\u5212\u5e76\u6613\u4e8e\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5b9e\u9645\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSOF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5149\u6d41\u6784\u5efa\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u6280\u80fd\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u8f6c\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSOF\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u7ec4\u5408\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SOF\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4ece\u6d77\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u590d\u6742\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Formally, the construction is a set- and measure-theoretic geometry: signals are represented as atomic measures on a signed state space, and similarity is given by a generalized Jaccard overlap of these measures. Each signal is embedded into a nonnegative multistate representation, using positive/negative splits for real signals, Cartesian and polar decompositions for complex signals, and user-defined state partitions for refined regime analysis. Applying the Tanimoto construction to these embeddings yields a family of $[0,1]$ distances that satisfy the triangle inequality and define positive-semidefinite kernels usable directly in kernel methods and graph-based learning. Beyond pairwise distances, we develop coalition analysis via M\u00f6bius inversion, which decomposes signal magnitude into nonnegative, additive contributions with exact budget closure across coalitions of signals. Normalizing the same embeddings produces probability measures on coordinate -- state configurations, so that the distance becomes a monotone transform of total variation and admits a regime -- intensity decomposition. The resulting construction yields a single, mechanistically interpretable distance that simultaneously provides bounded metric structure, positive-semidefinite kernels, probabilistic semantics, and transparent budget accounting within one sign-aware framework, supporting correlograms, feature engineering, similarity graphs, and other analytical tools in scientific and financial applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b26\u53f7\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u591a\u72b6\u6001Jaccard/Tanimoto\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u91cd\u53e0\u8ddd\u79bb\u4ece\u975e\u8d1f\u5411\u91cf\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u5b9e\u503c\u548c\u590d\u503c\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u754c\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u6b63\u534a\u5b9a\u6838\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4fe1\u53f7\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u5e26\u7b26\u53f7\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u6d4b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5e7f\u4e49Jaccard\u91cd\u53e0\u6765\u5b9a\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u8d1f\u591a\u72b6\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\uff08\u5b9e\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f7f\u7528\u6b63\u8d1f\u5206\u88c2\uff0c\u590d\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f7f\u7528\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u6216\u6781\u5750\u6807\u5206\u89e3\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528Tanimoto\u6784\u9020\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e09\u89d2\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u4e14\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u7684[0,1]\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u901a\u8fc7\u83ab\u6bd4\u4e4c\u65af\u53cd\u6f14\u5b9e\u73b0\u8054\u76df\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u5206\u89e3\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e45\u5ea6\u4e3a\u975e\u8d1f\u53ef\u52a0\u8d21\u732e\u9879\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9884\u7b97\u95ed\u5408\uff1b\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u540e\u5f97\u5230\u5750\u6807-\u72b6\u6001\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6d4b\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u8ddd\u79bb\u6210\u4e3a\u603b\u53d8\u5dee\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u5f0f-\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5206\u89e3\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7edf\u4e00\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u754c\u5ea6\u91cf\u3001\u6b63\u534a\u5b9a\u6838\u3001\u6982\u7387\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u900f\u660e\u9884\u7b97\u6838\u7b97\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u56fe\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u3001\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u56fe\u7b49\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u91d1\u878d\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u975e\u8d1f\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u5e26\u7b26\u53f7\u7684\u5b9e\u503c\u6216\u590d\u503c\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u91d1\u878d\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u517c\u5bb9\u4efb\u610f\u5b9e/\u590d\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u4fdd\u7559\u826f\u597d\u6570\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\uff08\u5982\u5ea6\u91cf\u6027\u3001\u6b63\u534a\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4fe1\u53f7\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5e26\u7b26\u53f7\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u6d4b\u5ea6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6b63\u8d1f\u5206\u88c2\uff08\u5b9e\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\u3001\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14/\u6781\u5750\u6807\u5206\u89e3\uff08\u590d\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\u6216\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u72b6\u6001\u5212\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u72b6\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u540e\u7684\u975e\u8d1f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e94\u7528Tanimoto\u516c\u5f0f\u6784\u9020[0,1]\u8ddd\u79bb\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u83ab\u6bd4\u4e4c\u65af\u53cd\u6f14\u5b9e\u73b0\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e45\u5ea6\u7684\u53ef\u52a0\u8d21\u732e\u5206\u89e3\uff1b\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u6982\u7387\u6d4b\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5efa\u7acb\u603b\u53d8\u5dee\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0e\u6a21\u5f0f-\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5206\u89e3\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u5b9e\u503c\u4e0e\u590d\u503c\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e09\u89d2\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u7684\u6709\u754c\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u6b63\u534a\u5b9a\u6838\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6982\u7387\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u9884\u7b97\u95ed\u5408\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u56fe\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u3001\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5b8c\u5907\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u901a\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u7c7b\u578b\u4fe1\u53f7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, the clinical relevance of the tissue characteristics at the micro- and macro-environment level is limited by the lack of tools that facilitate the measurement of the spatial interaction of individual structure characteristics and their association with clinical parameters. To address these challenges, we introduce HistoWAS (Histology-Wide Association Study), a computational framework designed to link tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes. Specifically, HistoWAS implements (1) a feature space that augments conventional metrics with 30 topological and spatial features, adapted from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) point pattern analysis, to quantify tissue micro-architecture; and (2) an association study engine, inspired by Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS), that performs mass univariate regression for each feature with statistical correction. As a proof of concept, we applied HistoWAS to analyze a total of 102 features (72 conventional object-level features and our 30 spatial features) using 385 PAS-stained WSIs from 206 participants in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP).

We introduce a general framework for LLM agents to maintain concise contexts through multi-step interaction: Acting through Belief Bottlenecks Expressed in Language (ABBEL), and methods to further improve ABBEL agents with RL post-training. ABBEL replaces long multi-step interaction history by a belief state, i.e., a natural language summary of what has been discovered about task-relevant unknowns. Under ABBEL, at each step the agent first updates a prior belief with the most recent observation from the environment to form a posterior belief, then uses only the posterior to select an action. We systematically evaluate frontier models under ABBEL across six diverse multi-step environments, finding that ABBEL supports generating interpretable beliefs while maintaining near-constant memory use over interaction steps. However, bottleneck approaches are generally prone to error propagation, which we observe causing inferior performance when compared to the full context setting due to errors in belief updating. Therefore, we train LLMs to generate and act on beliefs within the ABBEL framework via reinforcement learning (RL). We experiment with belief grading, to reward higher quality beliefs, as well as belief length penalties to reward more compressed beliefs.

Record-breaking heat waves, drenching rainfalls, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense. Rapid and efficient response to disaster events is essential for climate resilience and sustainability. A key challenge in disaster response is to accurately and quickly identify disaster locations to support decision-making and resources allocation. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Cross-view Geolocalization approach, called ProbGLC, exploring new pathways towards generative location awareness for rapid disaster response. Herein, we combine probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models into a unified framework to simultaneously enhance model explainability (via uncertainty quantification) and achieve state-of-the-art geolocalization performance. Designed for rapid diaster response, the ProbGLC is able to address cross-view geolocalization across multiple disaster events as well as to offer unique features of probabilistic distribution and localizability score. To evaluate the ProbGLC, we conduct extensive experiments on two cross-view disaster datasets (i.e., MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster), consisting diverse cross-view imagery pairs of multiple disaster types (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires, floods, to tornadoes). Preliminary results confirms the superior geolocalization accuracy (i.e., 0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km) and model explainability (i.e., via probabilistic distributions and localizability scores) of the proposed ProbGLC approach, highlighting the great potential of leveraging generative cross-view approach to facilitate location awareness for better and faster disaster response.

Despite their recent success, multimodal RAG in the audio-visual domain remains challenging due to 1) limited modality coverage and multi-hop connectivity of existing MMKGs, and 2) retrieval based solely on similarity in a shared multimodal embedding space, which fails to filter out off-topic or redundant knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose M$^3$KG-RAG, a Multi-hop Multimodal Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG that retrieves query-aligned audio-visual knowledge from MMKGs, improving reasoning depth and answer faithfulness in MLLMs. Specifically, we devise a lightweight multi-agent pipeline to construct multi-hop MMKG (M$^3$KG), which contains context-enriched triplets of multimodal entities, enabling modality-wise retrieval based on input queries. Furthermore, we introduce GRASP (Grounded Retrieval And Selective Pruning), which ensures precise entity grounding to the query, evaluates answer-supporting relevance, and prunes redundant context to retain only knowledge essential for response generation. Extensive experiments across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that M$^3$KG-RAG significantly enhances MLLMs' multimodal reasoning and grounding over existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faM$^3$KG-RAG\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u8df3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff08M$^3$KG\uff09\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u68c0\u7d22\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7b54\u6848\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ba1\u9053\u6784\u5efa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165GRASP\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u67e5\u8be2\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u5b9e\u4f53\u7cbe\u51c6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ca\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u526a\u679d\u3002\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u5728\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u9886\u57df\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff08MMKG\uff09\u6a21\u6001\u8986\u76d6\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u8df3\u8fde\u63a5\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5171\u4eab\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65e0\u5173\u6216\u5197\u4f59\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faM$^3$KG-RAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u8df3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff08M$^3$KG\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1GRASP\uff08Grounded Retrieval And Selective Pruning\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u5b9e\u4f53\u7cbe\u51c6\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u7b54\u6848\u652f\u6301\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee5\u53ca\u5197\u4f59\u77e5\u8bc6\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4ec5\u4fdd\u7559\u5bf9\u56de\u7b54\u751f\u6210\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cM$^3$KG-RAG\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bf9\u9f50\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u660e\u663e\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "M$^3$KG-RAG\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u526a\u679d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u6a21\u6001RAG\u5728\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Although recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for policy-grounded moderation, the practical challenges of training these systems to achieve expert-level accuracy in real-world settings remain largely unexplored, particularly in regimes characterized by label sparsity, evolving policy definitions, and the need for nuanced reasoning beyond shallow pattern matching. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical investigation of scaling reinforcement learning (RL) for content classification, systematically evaluating multiple RL training recipes and reward-shaping strategies-including verifiable rewards and LLM-as-judge frameworks-to transform general-purpose language models into specialized, policy-aligned classifiers across three real-world content moderation tasks. Our findings provide actionable insights for industrial-scale moderation systems, demonstrating that RL exhibits sigmoid-like scaling behavior in which performance improves smoothly with increased training data, rollouts, and optimization steps before gradually saturating. Moreover, we show that RL substantially improves performance on tasks requiring complex policy-grounded reasoning while achieving up to 100x higher data efficiency than supervised fine-tuning, making it particularly effective in domains where expert annotations are scarce or costly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u5728\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86RL\u5728\u590d\u6742\u653f\u7b56\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe100\u500d\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u653f\u7b56\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u9762\u4e34\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u653f\u7b56\u9891\u7e41\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u8df5\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u88c1\u5224\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bf9\u901a\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u6539\u9020\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "RL\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7c7bS\u578b\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3001\u91c7\u6837\u6b21\u6570\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u5e73\u6ed1\u63d0\u5347\u5e76\u8d8b\u4e8e\u9971\u548c\uff1b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u653f\u7b56\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347100\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6216\u653f\u7b56\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u5185\u5bb9\u6cbb\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u843d\u5730\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While existing approaches treat data quality assessment and ML systems as isolated processes, our framework addresses the critical gap between theoretical methods and practical implementation by combining dynamic drift detection, adaptive data quality metrics, and MLOps into a cohesive, lightweight system. The key innovation lies in its operational efficiency, enabling real-time, quality-driven ML decision-making with minimal computational overhead.

To handle complex multi-hop questions that are challenging for single-step retrieval, iterative RAG approaches incorporating reinforcement learning have been proposed. However, existing iterative RAG systems typically plan to decompose questions without leveraging information about the available retrieval corpus, leading to inefficient retrieval and reasoning chains that cascade into suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce Early Knowledge Alignment (EKA), a simple but effective module that aligns LLMs with retrieval set before planning in iterative RAG systems with contextually relevant retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments on six standard RAG datasets demonstrate that by establishing a stronger reasoning foundation, EKA significantly improves retrieval precision, reduces cascading errors, and enhances both performance and efficiency. Our analysis from an entropy perspective demonstrate that incorporating early knowledge reduces unnecessary exploration during the reasoning process, enabling the model to focus more effectively on relevant information subsets. Moreover, EKA proves effective as a versatile, training-free inference strategy that scales seamlessly to large models. Generalization tests across diverse datasets and retrieval corpora confirm the robustness of our approach. Overall, EKA advances the state-of-the-art in iterative RAG systems while illuminating the critical interplay between structured reasoning and efficient exploration in reinforcement learning-augmented frameworks.

Current approaches suffer from exposure bias leading to misaligned explanations. We propose Reason2Decide, a two-stage training framework that addresses key challenges in self-rationalization, including exposure bias and task separation. In Stage-1, our model is trained on rationale generation, while in Stage-2, we jointly train on label prediction and rationale generation, applying scheduled sampling to gradually transition from conditioning on gold labels to model predictions. We evaluate Reason2Decide on three medical datasets, including a proprietary triage dataset and public biomedical QA datasets. Across model sizes, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity (BERTScore, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge). In triage, Reason2Decide is rationale source-robust across LLM-generated, nurse-authored, and nurse-post-processed rationales. In our experiments, while using only LLM-generated rationales in Stage-1, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning variants. This indicates that LLM-generated rationales are suitable for pretraining models, reducing reliance on human annotations. Remarkably, Reason2Decide achieves these gains with models 40x smaller than contemporary foundation models, making clinical reasoning more accessible for resource-constrained deployments while still providing explainable decision support.", "AI": {"tldr": "Reason2Decide \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u56e0\u66b4\u9732\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4e13\u6ce8\u751f\u6210\u7406\u7531\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u6807\u7b7e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7406\u7531\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u8c03\u5ea6\u91c7\u6837\u9010\u6b65\u4ece\u4f9d\u8d56\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08F1\uff09\u548c\u7406\u7531\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff08\u5982BERTScore\u3001BLEU\u3001LLM-as-a-Judge\uff09\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u5206\u8bca\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u6765\u6e90\u7406\u7531\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7406\u7531\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u5373\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6240\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u76841/40\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f7f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u66f4\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u53d7\u66b4\u9732\u504f\u5dee\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u6d3d\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89e3\u91ca\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4ec5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7406\u7531\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u6807\u7b7e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7406\u7531\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8c03\u5ea6\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u6211\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cReason2Decide \u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff08F1\uff09\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\uff08BERTScore\u3001BLEU\u3001LLM-as-a-Judge\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5728\u5206\u8bca\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u7406\u7531\u6765\u6e90\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u7406\u7531\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4ec5\u4e3a\u540c\u7c7b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u76841/40\u3002", "conclusion": "Reason2Decide \u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8c03\u5ea6\u91c7\u6837\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u66b4\u9732\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u79bb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9ad8\u89e3\u91ca\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5e76\u91cd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

From malware detection to enabling autonomous navigation, modern machine learning systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. However, as these models are deployed in ever-changing real-world scenarios, their ability to remain reliable and adaptive over time becomes increasingly important. For example, in the real world, new malware families are continuously developed, whereas autonomous driving cars are employed in many different cities and weather conditions. Models trained in fixed settings can not respond effectively to novel conditions encountered post-deployment. In fact, most machine learning models are still developed under the assumption that training and test data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), i.e., sampled from the same underlying (unknown) distribution. While this assumption simplifies model development and evaluation, it does not hold in many real-world applications, where data changes over time and unexpected inputs frequently occur. Retraining models from scratch whenever new data appears is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and impractical in resource-constrained environments. These limitations underscore the need for Continual Learning (CL), which enables models to incrementally learn from evolving data streams without forgetting past knowledge, and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, which allows systems to identify and respond to novel or anomalous inputs. Jointly addressing both challenges is critical to developing robust, efficient, and adaptive AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff08Continual Learning, CL\uff09\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08Out-of-Distribution, OOD\uff09\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u968f\u7740\u6570\u636e\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u65b0\u7c7b\u578b\u8f93\u5165\u9891\u7e41\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5047\u8bbe\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\uff08i.i.d.\uff09\u5df2\u4e0d\u518d\u9002\u7528\u3002\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u9057\u5fd8\u65e7\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u8bc6\u522b\u5f02\u5e38\u6216\u65b0\u9896\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8054\u5408\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e24\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u5bf9\u6784\u5efa\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u65b0\u6837\u672c\u4e0d\u65ad\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8ei.i.d.\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u8f93\u5165\u3002\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u4ef7\u9ad8\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u4e14\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u5f02\u5e38\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CL\uff09\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08OOD\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u9057\u5fd8\u5df2\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u8d85\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u6f02\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u8054\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

Existing weakly supervised approaches often struggle to align fine-grained spatial structures with coarse labels, leading to noisy supervision and degraded mapping accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose DDTM, a dual-branch weakly supervised framework that explicitly decouples local semantic refinement from global contextual reasoning. Specifically, DDTM introduces a diffusion-based branch to progressively refine fine-scale local semantics under coarse supervision, while a transformer-based branch enforces long-range contextual consistency across large spatial extents. In addition, we design a pseudo-label confidence evaluation module to mitigate noise induced by cross-resolution inconsistencies and to selectively exploit reliable supervisory signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDTM establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Chesapeake Bay benchmark, achieving 66.52\\% mIoU and substantially outperforming prior weakly supervised methods.

Researchers have effectively employed the ``pre-train, prompt, and predict'' paradigm through prompt learning to induce improved few-shot performance. However, prompt learning approaches for PFMs still follow a parametric learning paradigm. As such, the stability of generalization in memorization and rote learning can be compromised. More specifically, conventional prompt learning might face difficulties in fully utilizing atypical instances and avoiding overfitting to shallow patterns with limited data during the process of fully-supervised training. To overcome these constraints, we present our approach, named RetroPrompt, which aims to achieve a balance between memorization and generalization by decoupling knowledge from mere memorization. Unlike traditional prompting methods, RetroPrompt leverages a publicly accessible knowledge base generated from the training data and incorporates a retrieval mechanism throughout the input, training, and inference stages. This enables the model to actively retrieve relevant contextual information from the corpus, thereby enhancing the available cues. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a variety of datasets across natural language processing and computer vision tasks to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach, RetroPrompt, in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Through detailed analysis of memorization patterns, we observe that RetroPrompt effectively reduces the reliance on rote memorization, leading to enhanced generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "RetroPrompt \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u5355\u7eaf\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u83b7\u53d6\u76f8\u5173\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u673a\u68b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u9075\u5faa\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u4e8e\u6d45\u5c42\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "RetroPrompt \u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u96c6\u6210\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u4e3b\u52a8\u4ece\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7ebf\u7d22\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cRetroPrompt \u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5bf9\u673a\u68b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "RetroPrompt \u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing models face critical challenges: temporal resolution mismatch between speech tokens (25Hz) and text tokens (~3Hz) dilutes semantic information, incurs high computational costs, and causes catastrophic forgetting of text LLM knowledge. We introduce Fun-Audio-Chat, a Large Audio Language Model addressing these limitations via two innovations from our previous work DrVoice. First, Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR): the Shared LLM processes audio at efficient 5Hz (via token grouping), while the Speech Refined Head generates high-quality tokens at 25Hz, balancing efficiency (~50% GPU reduction) and quality. Second, Core-Cocktail Training, a two-stage fine-tuning with intermediate merging that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. We then apply Multi-Task DPO Training to enhance robustness, audio understanding, instruction-following and voice empathy. This multi-stage post-training enables Fun-Audio-Chat to retain text LLM knowledge while gaining powerful audio understanding, reasoning, and generation. Unlike recent LALMs requiring large-scale audio-text pre-training, Fun-Audio-Chat leverages pre-trained models and extensive post-training. Fun-Audio-Chat 8B and MoE 30B-A3B achieve competitive performance on Speech-to-Text and Speech-to-Speech tasks, ranking top among similar-scale models on Spoken QA benchmarks.

The key challenge lies in tokenizing TS data into textual representations that align with LLMs' pre-trained knowledge. While existing work often relies on fine-tuning specialized modules to bridge this gap, a distinct, yet challenging, paradigm aims to leverage truly off-the-shelf LLMs without any fine-tuning whatsoever, relying solely on strategic tokenization of numerical sequences. The performance of these fully frozen models is acutely sensitive to the textual representation of the input data, as their parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet highly effective strategy to overcome this brittleness: injecting noise into the raw time series before tokenization. This non-invasive intervention acts as a form of inference-time augmentation, compelling the frozen LLM to extrapolate based on robust underlying temporal patterns rather than superficial numerical artifacts. We theoretically analyze this phenomenon and empirically validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks. Notably, to fully eliminate potential biases from data contamination during LLM pre-training, we introduce two novel TS datasets that fall outside all utilized LLMs' pre-training scopes, and consistently observe improved performance.

This perspective is limiting in practice, as failures in chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning are frequently structured; solutions may appear convincing while containing subtle logical, algebraic, or numerical flaws. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) variants that rely on large reward models or LLM-as-a-judge signals are often expensive, difficult to scale, and unstable to iterate. We propose a lightweight and pragmatic post-training pipeline that targets such structured errors under realistic compute budgets. Starting from supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on MetaMathQA-style CoT data, we introduce a compact MathVerifier that decomposes a candidate solution into a six-dimensional error profile and aggregates it into interpretable wrongness and absurdity scores. These verifier signals serve two roles: (i) mining hard negatives that are near-correct yet structurally flawed, and (ii) defining per-sample importance weights that emphasize the most informative preference pairs. We integrate both into an offline Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) objective via a verifier-guided weighted formulation. Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter Qwen2.5 model show that verifier-guided, weighted DPO yields more targeted improvements than vanilla SFT and unweighted DPO, particularly on problems where solutions are numerically close to correct but logically inconsistent, while avoiding the overhead of training large reward models or relying on external judges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u7d27\u51d1\u7684MathVerifier\uff0c\u5c06\u5019\u9009\u89e3\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u516d\u7ef4\u8bef\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8352\u8c2c\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u3002\u8be5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u6316\u6398\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6b63\u786e\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u6216\u6570\u503c\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u96be\u4f8b\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6743\u91cd\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08DPO\uff09\uff0c\u57281.5B\u53c2\u6570Qwen2.5\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfSFT\u548c\u672a\u52a0\u6743DPO\u80fd\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9519\u8bef\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u578b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5e38\u56e0\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u903b\u8f91\u3001\u4ee3\u6570\u6216\u6570\u503c\u9519\u8bef\u800c\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4ee5\u6b63\u786e/\u9519\u8bef\u4e8c\u5143\u5224\u65ad\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RLHF\uff09\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4eceMetaMathQA\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684MathVerifier\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c06\u89e3\u9898\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u516d\u7ef4\u8bef\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u9519\u8bef\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8352\u8c2c\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bc4\u5206\u6316\u6398\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6b63\u786e\u4f46\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u96be\u4f8b\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u6837\u672c\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6743\u91cd\uff1b\u5c06\u6b64\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5165\u79bb\u7ebf\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08DPO\uff09\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u52a0\u6743DPO\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u57281.5B\u53c2\u6570\u7684Qwen2.5\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u52a0\u6743DPO\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6SFT\u548c\u672a\u52a0\u6743DPO\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u89e3\u9898\u7ed3\u679c\u6570\u503c\u63a5\u8fd1\u6b63\u786e\u4f46\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u578b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u8bc4\u59d4\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u52a0\u6743DPO\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u4fee\u590d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Current models can parse simple, single-target commands but fail when presented with complex geospatial scenarios, e.g., segmenting objects at various granularities, executing multi-target instructions, and interpreting implicit user intent. To drive progress against these failures, we present LaSeRS, the first large-scale dataset built for comprehensive training and evaluation across four critical dimensions of language-guided segmentation: hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning requirements, and linguistic variability. By capturing these dimensions, LaSeRS moves beyond simple commands, providing a benchmark for complex geospatial reasoning. This addresses a critical gap: existing datasets oversimplify, leading to sensitivity-prone real-world models. We also propose SegEarth-R2, an MLLM architecture designed for comprehensive language-guided segmentation in RS, which directly confronts these challenges. The model's effectiveness stems from two key improvements: (1) a spatial attention supervision mechanism specifically handles the localization of small objects and their components, and (2) a flexible and efficient segmentation query mechanism that handles both single-target and multi-target scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our SegEarth-R2 achieves outstanding performance on LaSeRS and other benchmarks, establishing a powerful baseline for the next generation of geospatial segmentation.

In this paper, we introduce FaithLens, a cost-efficient and effective faithfulness hallucination detection model that can jointly provide binary predictions and corresponding explanations to improve trustworthiness. To achieve this, we first synthesize training data with explanations via advanced LLMs and apply a well-defined data filtering strategy to ensure label correctness, explanation quality, and data diversity. Subsequently, we fine-tune the model on these well-curated training data as a cold start and further optimize it with rule-based reinforcement learning, using rewards for both prediction correctness and explanation quality. Results on 12 diverse tasks show that the 8B-parameter FaithLens outperforms advanced models such as GPT-4.1 and o3.

The recent increasing demand for edge computing and AI advancements drives the growth of data center storage capacity. Energy efficiency is a cost-effective way to combat climate change, cut energy costs, improve business competitiveness, and promote IT and environmental sustainability. Thus, optimizing data center energy management is the most important factor in the sustainability of the world. Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is used to represent the operational efficiency of the data center. Predicting PUE using Neural Networks provides an understanding of the effect of each feature on energy consumption, thus enabling targeted modifications of those key features to improve energy efficiency. In this paper, we have developed Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) based PUE prediction model and compared the model performance with GRU. The data set comprises 52,560 samples with 117 features using EnergyPlus, simulating a DC in Singapore.

Their iterative sampling also incurs substantial computational and energy costs, hindering industrial and edge AI applications. To address these issues, we propose the Flow Matching-based Foundation Model (FlowFM), which jointly trains a representation encoder and a conditional flow matching generator. This decoupled design achieves both high-fidelity generation and effective recognition. By using flow matching to learn a simpler velocity field, FlowFM accelerates and stabilizes training, improving its efficiency for representation learning. Experiments on wearable sensor data show FlowFM reduces training time by 50.4\\% compared to a diffusion-based approach. On downstream tasks, FlowFM surpassed the state-of-the-art SSL method (SSL-Wearables) on all five datasets while achieving up to a 51.0x inference speedup and maintaining high generative quality.

This study investigates whether incorporating road-facing views alongside driver-facing footage improves distraction detection accuracy in naturalistic driving conditions. Using synchronized dual-camera recordings from real-world driving, we benchmark three leading spatiotemporal action recognition architectures: SlowFast-R50, X3D-M, and SlowOnly-R50. Each model is evaluated under two input configurations: driver-only and stacked dual-view. Results show that while contextual inputs can improve detection in certain models, performance gains depend strongly on the underlying architecture. The single-pathway SlowOnly model achieved a 9.8 percent improvement with dual-view inputs, while the dual-pathway SlowFast model experienced a 7.2 percent drop in accuracy due to representational conflicts.

To evaluate automatic systems for such a task, a versatile and realistic evaluation corpus is needed. Therefore, we create and present a corpus of cross-lingual dialogues between individuals without a common language who were facilitated by automatic simultaneous speech translation. The corpus consists of 5 hours of speech recordings with ASR and gold transcripts in 12 original languages and automatic and corrected translations into English. For the purposes of research into cross-lingual summarization, our corpus also includes written summaries (minutes) of the meetings.\n  Moreover, we propose automatic detection of misunderstandings. For an overview of this task and its complexity, we attempt to quantify misunderstandings in cross-lingual meetings. We annotate misunderstandings manually and also test the ability of current large language models to detect them automatically. The results show that the Gemini model is able to identify text spans with misunderstandings with recall of 77% and precision of 47%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u5305\u542b5\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u6db5\u76d612\u79cd\u539f\u59cb\u8bed\u8a00\u7684ASR\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u8f6c\u5f55\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u81ea\u52a8\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u6821\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u82f1\u6587\u8bd1\u6587\uff0c\u5e76\u9644\u6709\u4f1a\u8bae\u7eaa\u8981\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4f1a\u8bae\u4e2d\u7684\u8bef\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Gemini\uff09\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aGemini\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u8bef\u89e3\u6587\u672c\u7247\u6bb5\u4e0a\u5177\u670977%\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c47%\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u65e0\u5171\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4f1a\u8bae\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4e14\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u68c0\u6d4b\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea4\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u8bef\u89e3\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u52a8\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u8bd1\u6587\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u5f0f\u6807\u8bb0\u8bef\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Gemini\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "Gemini\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bef\u89e3\u6587\u672c\u7247\u6bb5\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u8fbe\u523077%\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u4e3a47%\uff1b\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e3a\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u603b\u7ed3\u7b49\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u8fd8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8bef\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6c9f\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

DOI: 10.1109/TIFS.2025.3610254", "summary": "Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to the security and reliability of deep learning models. To mitigate such attacks, one promising approach is to learn to extract features from the target model and use these features for backdoor detection. However, we discover that existing learning-based neural backdoor detection methods do not generalize well to new architectures not seen during the learning phase. In this paper, we analyze the root cause of this issue and propose a novel black-box neural backdoor detection method called ArcGen. Our method aims to obtain architecture-invariant model features, i.e., aligned features, for effective backdoor detection. Specifically, in contrast to existing methods directly using model outputs as model features, we introduce an additional alignment layer in the feature extraction function to further process these features. This reduces the direct influence of architecture information on the features. Then, we design two alignment losses to train the feature extraction function. These losses explicitly require that features from models with similar backdoor behaviors but different architectures are aligned at both the distribution and sample levels. With these techniques, our method demonstrates up to 42.5% improvements in detection performance (e.g., AUC) on unseen model architectures. This is based on a large-scale evaluation involving 16,896 models trained on diverse datasets, subjected to various backdoor attacks, and utilizing different model architectures.

However, since preferences of each user may vary, existing under-specified formulations often lead to suboptimal results that fail to align with individual user needs. We introduce a novel task that conditions paper-to-slides generation on user-specified preferences. We propose a human behavior-inspired agentic framework, SlideTailor, that progressively generates editable slides in a user-aligned manner. Instead of requiring users to write their preferences in detailed textual form, our system only asks for a paper-slides example pair and a visual template - natural and easy-to-provide artifacts that implicitly encode rich user preferences across content and visual style. Despite the implicit and unlabeled nature of these inputs, our framework effectively distills and generalizes the preferences to guide customized slide generation. We also introduce a novel chain-of-speech mechanism to align slide content with planned oral narration. Such a design significantly enhances the quality of generated slides and enables downstream applications like video presentations. To support this new task, we construct a benchmark dataset that captures diverse user preferences, with carefully designed interpretable metrics for robust evaluation.

However, ensuring safety remains a critical challenge across many domains and tasks. Previous works on safe RL from human feedback (RLHF) first learn reward and cost models from offline data, then use constrained RL to optimize a safe policy. While such an approach works in the contextual bandits settings (LLMs), in long horizon continuous control tasks, errors in rewards and costs accumulate, leading to impairment in performance when used with constrained RL methods. To address these challenges, (a) instead of indirectly learning policies (from rewards and costs), we introduce a framework that learns a policy directly based on pairwise preferences regarding the agent's behavior in terms of rewards, as well as binary labels indicating the safety of trajectory segments; (b) we propose \\textsc{PreSa} (Preference and Safety Alignment), a method that combines preference learning module with safety alignment in a constrained optimization problem. This optimization problem is solved within a Lagrangian paradigm that directly learns reward-maximizing safe policy \\textit{without explicitly learning reward and cost models}, avoiding the need for constrained RL; (c) we evaluate our approach on continuous control tasks with both synthetic and real human feedback. Empirically, our method successfully learns safe policies with high rewards, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, and offline safe RL approaches with ground-truth reward and cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPreSa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u4e14\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u6bb5\u5b89\u5168\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5728\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u4e14\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u53ca\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cPreSa\u6210\u529f\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u4e14\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168RL\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "PreSa\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u504f\u597d\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebf\u504f\u597d\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Current methods often overlook the rich hierarchical structures, such as the semantic hierarchy of primitives (e.g., apple fruit) and the conceptual hierarchy between primitives and compositions (e.g, sliced apple apple). A few recent efforts have shown effectiveness in modeling these hierarchies through loss regularization within Euclidean space. In this paper, we argue that they fail to scale to the large-scale taxonomies required for real-world CZSL: the space's polynomial volume growth in flat geometry cannot match the exponential structure, impairing generalization capacity. To this end, we propose H2em, a new framework that learns Hierarchical Hyperbolic EMbeddings for CZSL. H2em leverages the unique properties of hyperbolic geometry, a space naturally suited for embedding tree-like structures with low distortion. However, a naive hyperbolic mapping may suffer from hierarchical collapse and poor fine-grained discrimination. We further design two learning objectives to structure this space: a Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss that uses hyperbolic entailment cones to enforce the predefined hierarchies, and a Discriminative Alignment Loss with hard negative mining to establish a large geodesic distance between semantically similar compositions. Furthermore, we devise Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention to realize instance-aware cross-modal infusion within hyperbolic geometry. Extensive ablations on three benchmarks demonstrate that H2em establishes a new state-of-the-art in both closed-world and open-world scenarios.

This task is particularly challenging for Mandarin, as visemes are highly ambiguous and homophones are prevalent. We propose VALLR-Pin, a novel two-stage framework that extends the recent VALLR architecture from English to Mandarin. First, a shared video encoder feeds into dual decoders, which jointly predict both Chinese character sequences and their standard Pinyin romanization. The multi-task learning of character and phonetic outputs fosters robust visual-semantic representations. During inference, the text decoder generates multiple candidate transcripts. We construct a prompt by concatenating the Pinyin output with these candidate Chinese sequences and feed it to a large language model to resolve ambiguities and refine the transcription. This provides the LLM with explicit phonetic context to correct homophone-induced errors. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM on synthetic noisy examples: we generate imperfect Pinyin-text pairs from intermediate VALLR-Pin checkpoints using the training data, creating instruction-response pairs for error correction. This endows the LLM with awareness of our model's specific error patterns.

Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in predicting outcomes from structured medical data, their predictions may exhibit demographic biases related to sex, age, and race, limiting their trustworthy use in clinical practice. Existing debiasing methods often reduce predictive performance, making it difficult to jointly optimize fairness and accuracy. In this study, we systematically examine bias in LLM-based ICU mortality prediction and propose a training-free, clinically adaptive prompting framework to simultaneously improve fairness and performance. We first develop a multi-dimensional bias assessment scheme for comprehensive model diagnosis. Building on this analysis, we introduce CAse Prompting (CAP), a novel prompting framework that integrates conventional debiasing prompts with case-based reasoning. CAP guides the model to learn from similar historical misprediction cases and their correct outcomes, enabling correction of biased reasoning patterns. Experiments on the MIMIC-IV dataset show that CAP substantially improves both predictive accuracy and fairness. CAP increases AUROC from 0.806 to 0.873 and AUPRC from 0.497 to 0.694, while reducing sex- and race-related disparities by over 90%. Feature reliance analysis further indicates highly consistent attention patterns across demographic groups, with similarity scores exceeding 0.98.

This gap limits the effectiveness of image understanding in domains like journalism, education, and digital archives, where richer, more informative descriptions are essential. To address this, we propose a multimodal pipeline that augments visual input with external textual knowledge. Our system retrieves semantically similar images using BEIT-3 (Flickr30k-384 and COCO-384) and SigLIP So-384, reranks them using ORB and SIFT for geometric alignment, and extracts contextual information from related articles via semantic search. A fine-tuned Qwen3 model with QLoRA then integrates this context with base captions generated by Instruct BLIP (Vicuna-7B) to produce event-enriched, context-aware descriptions. Evaluated on the OpenEvents v1 dataset, our approach generates significantly more informative captions compared to traditional methods, showing strong potential for real-world applications requiring deeper visual-textual understanding", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5916\u90e8\u6587\u672c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5229\u7528BEIT-3\u548cSigLIP\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u4f3c\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ORB\u548cSIFT\u8fdb\u884c\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u9f50\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u641c\u7d22\u4ece\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u7ae0\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7684Qwen3\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u91c7\u7528QLoRA\uff09\u878d\u5408\u57fa\u7840\u63cf\u8ff0\uff08\u7531Instruct BLIP\u751f\u6210\uff09\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002\u5728OpenEvents v1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65b0\u95fb\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u6863\u6848\u7b49\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5c42\u89c6\u89c9-\u6587\u672c\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u5e38\u7f3a\u4e4f\u80cc\u666f\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u7d22\u3001\u7ed3\u679c\u53ca\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u65b0\u95fb\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u6863\u6848\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7ba1\u9053\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7BEIT-3\u548cSigLIP\u68c0\u7d22\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b\u63a5\u7740\u5229\u7528ORB\u548cSIFT\u8fdb\u884c\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e76\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u641c\u7d22\u4ece\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u7ae0\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7684Qwen3\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u57fa\u4e8eQLoRA\uff09\u878d\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0eInstruct BLIP\u751f\u6210\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "result": "\u5728OpenEvents v1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2d\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u6587\u672c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u6587\u672c\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u65b0\u95fb\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u6863\u6848\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Evaluating Multilingual Large Language Models on Reasoning Traditional Bangla Tricky Riddles", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) show impressive performance on many NLP benchmarks, yet their ability to reason in figurative, culturally grounded, and low-resource settings remains underexplored. We address this gap for Bangla by introducing BanglaRiddleEval, a benchmark of 1,244 traditional Bangla riddles instantiated across four tasks (4,976 riddle-task artifacts in total). Using an LLM-based pipeline, we generate Chain-of-Thought explanations, semantically coherent distractors, and fine-grained ambiguity annotations, and evaluate a diverse suite of open-source and closed-source models under different prompting strategies. Models achieve moderate semantic overlap on generative QA but low correctness, MCQ accuracy peaks at only about 56% versus an 83% human baseline, and ambiguity resolution ranges from roughly 26% to 68%, with high-quality explanations confined to the strongest models. These results show that current LLMs capture some cues needed for Bangla riddle reasoning but remain far from human-level performance, establishing BanglaRiddleEval as a challenging new benchmark for low-resource figurative reasoning.

However, their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments is severely hin dered by high inference latency. While smooth robotic interaction requires control frequencies of 20 to 30 Hz, current VLA models typi cally operate at only 3-5 Hz on edge devices due to the memory bound nature of autoregressive decoding. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise model accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ActionFlow, a system-level inference framework tailored for resource-constrained edge plat forms. At the core of ActionFlow is a Cross-Request Pipelin ing strategy, a novel scheduler that redefines VLA inference as a macro-pipeline of micro-requests. The strategy intelligently batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across continuous time steps to maximize hardware utilization. Furthermore, to support this scheduling, we propose a Cross Request State Packed Forward operator and a Unified KV Ring Buffer, which fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations. Experimental results demonstrate that ActionFlow achieves a 2.55x improvement in FPS on the OpenVLA-7B model without retraining, enabling real-time dy namic manipulation on edge hardware.

However, progressive image compression with fine granular scalability (FGS)-which enables decoding a single bitstream at multiple quality levels-remains unexplored for machine-oriented codecs. In this work, we propose a novel progressive learned image compression codec for machine perception, PICM-Net, based on trit-plane coding. By analyzing the difference between human- and machine-oriented rate-distortion priorities, we systematically examine the latent prioritization strategies in terms of machine-oriented codecs. To further enhance real-world adaptability, we design an adaptive decoding controller, which dynamically determines the necessary decoding level during inference time to maintain the desired confidence of downstream machine prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enables efficient and adaptive progressive transmission while maintaining high performance in the downstream classification task, establishing a new paradigm for machine-aware progressive image compression.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u673a\u5668\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u7f16\u7801\u5668PICM-Net\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u5143\u5e73\u9762\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u611f\u77e5\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff08FGS\uff09\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4eba\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5728\u7387\u5931\u771f\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u611f\u77e5\u7f16\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89e3\u7801\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u5b9a\u89e3\u7801\u5c42\u7ea7\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u9884\u6d4b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u611f\u77e5\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u6811\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u673a\u5668\u611f\u77e5\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff09\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u7387\u5931\u771f\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u53ca\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPICM-Net\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u5143\u5e73\u9762\u7f16\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4eba\u673a\u611f\u77e5\u5728\u7387\u5931\u771f\u76ee\u6807\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9002\u5408\u673a\u5668\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89e3\u7801\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u89e3\u7801\u5c42\u7ea7\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u9884\u6d4b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6e10\u8fdb\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u9996\u6b21\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u673a\u5668\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89e3\u7801\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u673a\u5668\u611f\u77e5\u56fe\u50cf\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u667a\u80fd\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Summarization can condense fragmented, emotion-rich posts, but existing methods-optimized for structured news-struggle with noisy, informal content. Emotional cues are critical for IS tasks such as brand monitoring and market analysis, yet few studies integrate sentiment modeling into summarization of short user-generated texts. We propose a sentiment-aware framework extending extractive (TextRank) and abstractive (UniLM) approaches by embedding sentiment signals into ranking and generation processes.

Although deep learning-based HAR systems are widely adopted, the impact of Activation Functions (AFs) and Model Optimizers (MOs) on performance has not been sufficiently analyzed, particularly regarding how their combinations influence model behavior in practical scenarios. Most existing studies focus on architecture design, while the interaction between AF and MO choices remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we investigate the effect of three commonly used activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh) combined with four optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad) using two recurrent deep learning architectures, namely BiLSTM and ConvLSTM. Experiments are conducted on six medically relevant activity classes selected from the HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets, considering their suitability for healthcare-oriented HAR applications. Our experimental results show that ConvLSTM consistently outperforms BiLSTM across both datasets. ConvLSTM, combined with Adam or RMSprop, achieves an accuracy of up to 99.00%, demonstrating strong spatio-temporal learning capabilities and stable performance. While BiLSTM performs reasonably well on UCF101, with accuracy approaching 98.00%, its performance drops to approximately 60.00% on HMDB51, indicating limited robustness across datasets and weaker sensitivity to AF and MO variations.

However, realizing accurate KWS models on ultra-low-power TinyML devices (often with less than $<2$ MB of flash memory) necessitates a delicate balance between accuracy with strict resource constraints. Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) is an ideal candidate for managing such a trade-off but is highly initialization-dependent, especially under the budgeted black-box setting. Existing methods typically fall back to naive, ad-hoc sampling routines (e.g., Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), Sobol sequences, or Random search) that are adapted to neither the Pareto front nor undergo rigorous statistical comparison. To address this, we propose Objective-Aware Surrogate Initialization (OASI), a novel initialization strategy that leverages Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA) to generate a seed Pareto set of high-performing and diverse configurations that explicitly balance accuracy and model size. Evaluated in a TinyML KWS setting, OASI outperforms LHS, Sobol, and Random initialization, achieving the highest hypervolume (0.0627) and the lowest generational distance (0.0) across multiple runs, with only a modest increase in computation time (1934 s vs. $\\sim$1500 s). A non-parametric statistical analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test ($H = 5.40$, $p = 0.144$, $\u03b7^2 = 0.0007$) and Dunn's post-hoc test confirms OASI's superior consistency despite the non-significant overall difference with respect to the $\u03b1=0.05$ threshold.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aOASI\u7684\u65b0\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u8d85\u4f4e\u529f\u8017TinyML\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08KWS\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\uff08MOSA\uff09\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u914d\u7f6e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u968f\u673a\u3001\u62c9\u4e01\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u6216Sobol\u5e8f\u5217\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cOASI\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8fd0\u884c\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u8d85\u4f53\u79ef\uff080.0627\uff09\u548c\u6700\u4f4e\u7684\u4e16\u4ee3\u8ddd\u79bb\uff080.0\uff09\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4ec5\u7565\u6709\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6574\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u672a\u8fbe\u663e\u8457\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8d85\u4f4e\u529f\u8017TinyML\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08KWS\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\uff08\u5982\u95ea\u5b58\uff09\u4e25\u683c\u6743\u8861\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982LHS\u3001Sobol\u3001\u968f\u673a\u641c\u7d22\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff08MOBO\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u63d0\u5347MOBO\u5728\u9884\u7b97\u9ed1\u7bb1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faObjective-Aware Surrogate Initialization (OASI)\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\uff08MOSA\uff09\u751f\u6210\u79cd\u5b50\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ee9\u6548\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u521d\u59cb\u70b9\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u5f0f\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u3002", "result": "\u5728TinyML KWS\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cOASI\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8fd0\u884c\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\uff1a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u9ad8\u8d85\u4f53\u79ef\uff080.0627\uff09\u548c\u6700\u4f4e\u751f\u6210\u8ddd\u79bb\uff080.0\uff09\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u7565\u589e\uff081934\u79d2\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7ea61500\u79d2\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u6536\u76ca\u663e\u8457\u3002\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u9a8c\uff08Kruskal-Wallis H=5.40, p=0.144, \u03b7\u00b2=0.0007\uff09\u4e0eDunn\u4e8b\u540e\u68c0\u9a8c\u786e\u8ba4\u5176\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "OASI\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5176\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u521d\u59cb\u89e3\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Although previous methods achieve LiDAR point cloud generation from user inputs, they struggle to attain high-quality results while enabling versatile controllability, due to the imbalance between the complex distribution of LiDAR point clouds and the simple control signals. To address the limitation, we propose LiDARDraft, which utilizes the 3D layout to build a bridge between versatile conditional signals and LiDAR point clouds. The 3D layout can be trivially generated from various user inputs such as textual descriptions and images. Specifically, we represent text, images, and point clouds as unified 3D layouts, which are further transformed into semantic and depth control signals. Then, we employ a rangemap-based ControlNet to guide LiDAR point cloud generation.

Self-Awareness via Internal Circuits", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent and complex outputs but often fail to recognize their own mistakes and hallucinations. Existing approaches typically rely on external judges, multi-sample consistency, or text-based self-critique, which incur additional compute or correlate weakly with true correctness. We ask: can LLMs predict their own failures by inspecting internal states during inference? We introduce Gnosis, a lightweight self-awareness mechanism that enables frozen LLMs to perform intrinsic self-verification by decoding signals from hidden states and attention patterns. Gnosis passively observes internal traces, compresses them into fixed-budget descriptors, and predicts correctness with negligible inference cost, adding only ~5M parameters and operating independently of sequence length. Across math reasoning, open-domain question answering, and academic knowledge benchmarks, and over frozen backbones ranging from 1.7B to 20B parameters, Gnosis consistently outperforms strong internal baselines and large external judges in both accuracy and calibration. Moreover, it generalizes zero-shot to partial generations, enabling early detection of failing trajectories and compute-aware control. These results show that reliable correctness cues are intrinsic to generation process and can be extracted efficiently without external supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "Gnosis \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u81ea\u77e5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u5728\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u5b83\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u88c1\u5224\u6216\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u7ea6500\u4e07\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5c31\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u5b66\u672f\u77e5\u8bc6\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u65e9\u671f\u5931\u8d25\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7545\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u81ea\u8eab\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u88c1\u5224\u3001\u591a\u6837\u672c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6216\u6587\u672c\u81ea\u8bc4\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6216\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5173\u8054\u5f31\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "Gnosis \u88ab\u52a8\u89c2\u5bdf\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u75d5\u8ff9\uff0c\u5c06\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u56fa\u5b9a\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u9884\u6d4b\u8f93\u51fa\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u6574\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bf9\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u4f4e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u51bb\u7ed3\u6a21\u578b\uff081.7B \u5230 20B \u53c2\u6570\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cGnosis \u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u5927\u578b\u5916\u90e8\u88c1\u5224\uff1b\u4e14\u53ef\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u81f3\u90e8\u5206\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u5931\u8d25\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u7ebf\u7d22\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u5f0f\u4ece\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u5185\u5728\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose a lightweight yet effective multi-stage optimization pipeline designed to compress and accelerate Vision Transformers (ViTs) for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Our methodology combines activation profiling, memory-aware pruning, selective mixed-precision execution, and activation-aware quantization (AWQ) to reduce the model's memory footprint without requiring costly retraining or task-specific fine-tuning. Starting from a ViT-Huge backbone with 632 million parameters, we first identify low-importance channels using activation statistics collected via forward hooks, followed by structured pruning to shrink the MLP layers under a target memory budget. We further apply FP16 conversion to selected components and leverage AWQ to quantize the remaining model weights and activations to INT8 with minimal accuracy degradation. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the fully optimized model achieves a 76% reduction in peak memory usage and over 6x lower latency, while retaining or even improving accuracy compared to the original FP32 baseline. This framework offers a practical path toward efficient transformer inference on edge platforms, and opens future avenues for integrating dynamic sparsity and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures to further scale performance across diverse tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u538b\u5668\uff08ViT\uff09\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u611f\u77e5\u526a\u679d\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6267\u884c\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u611f\u77e5\u91cf\u5316\uff08AWQ\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eViT-Huge\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5728CIFAR-10\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b076%\u7684\u5cf0\u503c\u5185\u5b58\u964d\u4f4e\u548c6\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u5e73\u53f0\u9ad8\u6548Transformer\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u96c6\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\uff08MoE\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u5927\u89c4\u6a21Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u4e0e\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u611f\u77e5\u526a\u679d\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u6fc0\u6d3b\u611f\u77e5\u91cf\u5316\uff08AWQ\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u539f\u59cbViT-Huge\u6a21\u578b\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u3001\u6743\u91cd\u4e0e\u6fc0\u6d3b\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u5185\u5b58\u9884\u7b97\u5185\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b076%\u7684\u5cf0\u503c\u5185\u5b58\u51cf\u5c11\u3001\u8d85\u8fc76\u500d\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0d\u964d\u53cd\u5347\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cbFP32\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u7684ViT\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u6269\u5c55\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u7aefTransformer\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Cube available at https://github.com/dana-23/cube-bench", "summary": "We introduce Cube Bench, a Rubik's-cube benchmark for evaluating spatial and sequential reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The benchmark decomposes performance into five skills: (i) reconstructing cube faces from images and text, (ii) choosing the optimal next move, (iii) predicting the outcome of a candidate move without applying it, (iv) executing multi-step plans while recovering from mistakes, and (v) detecting and revising one's own errors. Using a shared set of scrambled cube states, identical prompts and parsers, and a single distance-to-solved metric, we compare recent MLLMs side by side as a function of scramble depth. Across seven MLLMs, accuracy drops sharply with depth; once a trajectory stalls or diverges, models rarely recover, and high face-reconstruction accuracy does not guarantee competent action selection or multi-step execution. A pronounced closed- vs open-source gap emerges: the strongest closed model leads on both single-step perception tasks and multi-step control tasks, while open-weight models cluster near chance on the hardest settings; yet even the best MLLM degrades at higher cube complexity. A simple self-correction via reflective thinking yields modest gains but can also introduce overthinking.

However, their application in predictive tasks remains less researched. This study compares large language models, including GatorTron-Base (trained on clinical data), Llama 8B, and Mistral 7B, against models like BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec, setting benchmarks for predicting Shock in critically ill patients. Timely prediction of shock can enable early interventions, thus improving patient outcomes. Text data from 17,294 ICU stays of patients in the MIMIC III database were scored for length of stay > 24 hours and shock index (SI) > 0.7 to yield 355 and 87 patients with normal and abnormal SI-index, respectively. Both focal and cross-entropy losses were used during finetuning to address class imbalances. Our findings indicate that while GatorTron Base achieved the highest weighted recall of 80.5%, the overall performance metrics were comparable between SLMs and LLMs. This suggests that LLMs are not inherently superior to SLMs in predicting future clinical events despite their strong performance on text-based tasks. To achieve meaningful clinical outcomes, future efforts in training LLMs should prioritize developing models capable of predicting clinical trajectories rather than focusing on simpler tasks such as named entity recognition or phenotyping.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86GatorTron-Base\u3001Llama 8B\u3001Mistral 7B\u7b49\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e0eBioBERT\u3001DocBERT\u7b49\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLMs\uff09\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5371\u91cd\u60a3\u8005\u4f11\u514b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528MIMIC-III\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d17,294\u4f8bICU\u4f4f\u9662\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4f\u9662\u65f6\u957f\u548c\u4f11\u514b\u6307\u6570\uff08SI > 0.7\uff09\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa\u6b63\u5e38\u4e0e\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u7126\u70b9\u635f\u5931\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1GatorTron Base\u5728\u52a0\u6743\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523080.5%\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u603b\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u5728LLMs\u4e0eSLMs\u95f4\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8868\u660eLLMs\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65b9\u9762\u5e76\u4e0d\u5929\u7136\u4f18\u4e8eSLMs\u3002\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u6216\u8868\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u7b49\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5df2\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u3002\u53ca\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u4f11\u514b\u53ef\u4fc3\u8fdb\u65e9\u671f\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u60a3\u8005\u9884\u540e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u8be5\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLMs\uff09\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eMIMIC-III\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u9009\u53d617,294\u4f8b\u91cd\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u4f9d\u636e\u4f4f\u9662\u65f6\u957f>24\u5c0f\u65f6\u53ca\u4f11\u514b\u6307\u6570\uff08SI\uff09>0.7\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa355\u540d\u6b63\u5e38\u4e0e87\u540d\u5f02\u5e38\u60a3\u8005\u3002\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5305\u62ecGatorTron-Base\u3001Llama 8B\u3001Mistral 7B\u5728\u5185\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0eBioBERT\u3001DocBERT\u3001Word2Vec\u3001Doc2Vec\u7b49\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u7126\u70b9\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4f11\u514b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "GatorTron-Base\u5728\u52a0\u6743\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523080.5%\uff0c\u4e3a\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6700\u9ad8\uff1b\u4f46\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65b9\u9762\u5e76\u672a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65b9\u9762\u5e76\u4e0d\u5929\u7136\u4f18\u4e8e\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5176\u5728\u6587\u672c\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u4e34\u5e8a\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e94\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u6216\u8868\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u7b49\u57fa\u7840\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new possibilities to leverage their capabilities in HAR, enabling not just activity classification but also interpretability and human-like interaction. In this paper, we present a Large Multi-Modal Agent designed for HAR, which integrates the power of LLMs to enhance both performance and user engagement.

However, existing methods often suffer from multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment, which lead to biases toward louder or larger objects while overlooking weaker, smaller, or co-occurring sources. To address these challenges, we propose DDAVS, a Disentangled Audio Semantics and Delayed Bidirectional Alignment framework. To mitigate multi-source entanglement, DDAVS employs learnable queries to extract audio semantics and anchor them within a structured semantic space derived from an audio prototype memory bank. This is further optimized through contrastive learning to enhance discriminability and robustness. To alleviate audio-visual misalignment, DDAVS introduces dual cross-attention with delayed modality interaction, improving the robustness of multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments on the AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks demonstrate that DDAVS consistently outperforms existing approaches, exhibiting strong performance across single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance scenarios. These results validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our framework under challenging real-world audio-visual segmentation conditions.

To address these challenges, MoE-DiffuSeq integrates sparse attention with a mixture of experts architecture, enabling efficient and scalable long sequence modeling. Our approach introduces a customized sparse attention mechanism designed to reduce computational complexity while preserving text quality and coherence. In addition, we incorporate a soft absorbing state within the diffusion process to accelerate sequence reconstruction and improve generation precision.

Existing pruning approaches treat either tokens or heads in isolation, relying on heuristics or first-order signals, which often sacrifice accuracy or fail to generalize across inputs. We introduce HEART-ViT, a Hessian-guided efficient dynamic attention and token pruning framework for vision transformers, which to the best of our knowledge is the first unified, second-order, input-adaptive framework for ViT optimization. HEART-ViT estimates curvature-weighted sensitivities of both tokens and attention heads using efficient Hessian-vector products, enabling principled pruning decisions under explicit loss budgets.This dual-view sensitivity reveals an important structural insight: token pruning dominates computational savings, while head pruning provides fine-grained redundancy removal, and their combination achieves a superior trade-off. On ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1K with ViT-B/16 and DeiT-B/16, HEART-ViT achieves up to 49.4 percent FLOPs reduction, 36 percent lower latency, and 46 percent higher throughput, while consistently matching or even surpassing baseline accuracy after fine-tuning, for example 4.7 percent recovery at 40 percent token pruning. Beyond theoretical benchmarks, we deploy HEART-ViT on different edge devices such as AGX Orin, demonstrating that our reductions in FLOPs and latency translate directly into real-world gains in inference speed and energy efficiency. HEART-ViT bridges the gap between theory and practice, delivering the first unified, curvature-driven pruning framework that is both accuracy-preserving and edge-efficient.", "AI": {"tldr": "HEART-ViT \u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u9636\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u3001\u8f93\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97Hessian-Vector\u4e58\u79ef\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\uff08tokens\uff09\u7684\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u635f\u5931\u9884\u7b97\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\uff1a\u5757\u526a\u679d\u5e26\u6765\u4e3b\u8981\u7b97\u529b\u8282\u7701\uff0c\u5934\u526a\u679d\u5219\u7cbe\u7ec6\u53bb\u9664\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6-\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\u3002\u5728ImageNet-100/1K\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c1149.4%\u7684FLOPs\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e36%\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u63d0\u534746%\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8eAGX Orin\u7b49\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e5f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u80fd\u6548\u4e0a\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5355\u72ec\u5904\u7406\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u6216\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u89c4\u5219\u6216\u4e00\u9636\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u5934\u4e0e\u5757\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u9636\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u8f93\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHEART-ViT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u7684Hessian-vector\u4e58\u79ef\u4f30\u7b97\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u52a0\u6743\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u526a\u679d\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u635f\u5931\u9884\u7b97\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u4f7f\u526a\u679d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5728ViT-B/16\u548cDeiT-B/16\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad849.4%\u7684FLOPs\u51cf\u5c11\u300136%\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u300146%\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u572840%\u5757\u526a\u679d\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u6062\u590d4.7%\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u5728AGX Orin\u7b49\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u4e0e\u80fd\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "HEART-ViT\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u66f2\u7387\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002"}}

However, the radar signals are often sparse due to specular reflection, making the extraction of robust features from radar signals highly challenging. To address this, we present milliMamba, a radar-based 2D human pose estimation framework that jointly models spatio-temporal dependencies across both the feature extraction and decoding stages. Specifically, given the high dimensionality of radar inputs, we adopt a Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from longer sequences with linear complexity. A Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder then predicts joint coordinates across multiple frames. Together, this spatio-temporal modeling pipeline enables the model to leverage contextual cues from neighboring frames and joints to infer missing joints caused by specular reflections. To reinforce motion smoothness, we incorporate a velocity loss alongside the standard keypoint loss during training. Experiments on the TransHuPR and HuPR datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements, exceeding the baselines by 11.0 AP and 14.6 AP, respectively, while maintaining reasonable complexity.

One of the challenges is apple pose estimation, where key points, such as the calyx, are often occluded.

Due to the abovementioned occlusions, there can be conflicting and missing annotations of the same fruit between different images. Novel 3D reconstruction methods can be used to simplify annotating and enlarge datasets. We propose a novel pipeline consisting of 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct an orchard scene, simplified annotations, automated projection of the annotations to images, and the training and evaluation of a pose estimation method. Using our pipeline, 105 manual annotations were required to obtain 28,191 training labels, a reduction of 99.6%. Experimental results indicated that training with labels of fruits that are $\\leq95\\%$ occluded resulted in the best performance, with a neutral F1 score of 0.927 on the original images and 0.970 on the rendered images. Adjusting the size of the training dataset had small effects on the model performance in terms of F1 score and pose estimation accuracy. It was found that the least occluded fruits had the best position estimation, which worsened as the fruits became more occluded. It was also found that the tested pose estimation method was unable to correctly learn the orientation estimation of apples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u679c\u56ed\u573a\u666f3D\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u82f9\u679c\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5229\u75283D Gaussian Splatting\u8fdb\u884c\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u6295\u5f71\u751f\u6210\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6807\u7b7e\u3002\u4ec5\u9700105\u6b21\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u5373\u53ef\u751f\u621028,191\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u6807\u6ce8\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u534799.6%\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u906e\u6321\u7387\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc795%\u7684\u679c\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0aF1\u5f97\u5206\u4e3a0.927\uff0c\u6e32\u67d3\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8fbe0.970\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f30\u8ba1\u5728\u4f4e\u906e\u6321\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u597d\uff0c\u968f\u906e\u6321\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u4f46\u5bf9\u671d\u5411\u4f30\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u82f9\u679c\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u952e\u70b9\uff08\u5982\u679c\u67c4\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u5e38\u88ab\u906e\u6321\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6807\u6ce8\u56f0\u96be\u4e14\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6216\u7f3a\u5931\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u4e0d\u518d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u5176\u7528\u4e8e\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u5f0f\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u679c\u56ed\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u62103D Gaussian Splatting\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7ba1\u9053\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u91cd\u5efa\u679c\u56ed\u4e09\u7ef4\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u7b80\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u518d\u5c06\u6807\u6ce8\u4fe1\u606f\u81ea\u52a8\u6295\u5f71\u56de\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u9700105\u6b21\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u5373\u751f\u621028,191\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u6807\u6ce8\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u534799.6%\u3002\u5728\u906e\u6321\u7387\u226495%\u7684\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cfF1\u4e3a0.927\uff0c\u6e32\u67d3\u56fe\u50cf\u8fbe0.970\u3002\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f30\u8ba1\u968f\u906e\u6321\u7a0b\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u82f9\u679c\u671d\u5411\u3002\u8c03\u6574\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u7ba1\u9053\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u679c\u56ed\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u56e0\u906e\u6321\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u4eba\u5de5\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u82f9\u679c\u671d\u5411\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u7ed3\u5408\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5efa\u6a21\u6216\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Existing DIR methods are primarily based on image queries that retrieve documents within the same coarse semantic category, e.g., newspapers or receipts. However, these methods struggle to effectively retrieve document images in real-world scenarios where textual queries with fine-grained semantics are usually provided. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new Natural Language-based Document Image Retrieval (NL-DIR) benchmark with corresponding evaluation metrics. In this work, natural language descriptions serve as semantically rich queries for the DIR task. The NL-DIR dataset contains 41K authentic document images, each paired with five high-quality, fine-grained semantic queries generated and evaluated through large language models in conjunction with manual verification. We perform zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations of existing mainstream contrastive vision-language models and OCR-free visual document understanding (VDU) models.

In this paper, we systematically study multi-teacher distillation for vision foundation models and identify key factors that enable training at lower computational cost. We introduce Agglomerative Mixture-of-Experts Vision Foundation Models (AMoE), which distill knowledge from SigLIP2 and DINOv3 simultaneously into a Mixture-of-Experts student. We show that (1) our Asymmetric Relation-Knowledge Distillation loss preserves the geometric properties of each teacher while enabling effective knowledge transfer, (2) token-balanced batching that packs varying-resolution images into sequences with uniform token budgets stabilizes representation learning across resolutions without sacrificing performance, and (3) hierarchical clustering and sampling of training data--typically reserved for self-supervised learning--substantially improves sample efficiency over random sampling for multi-teacher distillation. By combining these findings, we curate OpenLVD200M, a 200M-image corpus that demonstrates superior efficiency for multi-teacher distillation. Instantiated in a Mixture-of-Experts.

The approach estimates Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE) with uplift learners and then solves a constrained allocation to decide who to target and which offer to deploy under limits such as budget or acceptable sales deterioration. Applied to retention messaging, event rewards, and spend-threshold assignment, the framework consistently outperforms propensity and static baselines in offline evaluations using uplift AUC, Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS), and Self-Normalized IPS (SNIPS). A production-scale online A/B test further validates strategic lift on revenue and completion while preserving customer-experience constraints.

However, they encounter difficulties in achieving both high-realism and high-fidelity at low bitrate, as the pixel-space distortion may not align with human perception. To address this issue, we introduce a Generative Latent Coding (GLC) architecture, which performs transform coding in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), instead of in the pixel space. The generative latent space is characterized by greater sparsity, richer semantic and better alignment with human perception, rendering it advantageous for achieving high-realism and high-fidelity compression. Additionally, we introduce a categorical hyper module to reduce the bit cost of hyper-information, and a code-prediction-based supervision to enhance the semantic consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our GLC maintains high visual quality with less than 0.04 bpp on natural images and less than 0.01 bpp on facial images. On the CLIC2020 test set, we achieve the same FID as MS-ILLM with 45% fewer bits. Furthermore, the powerful generative latent space enables various applications built on our GLC pipeline, such as image restoration and style transfer.

While prompt-based methods excel in few-shot scenarios, their effectiveness often plateaus as more data becomes available. Conversely, fine-tuning scales well with data but may underperform when training examples are scarce. We investigate a unified approach that bridges these two paradigms by incorporating in-context learning directly into the fine-tuning process. Specifically, we fine-tune the model on task-specific data augmented with in-context examples, mimicking the structure of k-shot prompts. This approach, while requiring per-task fine-tuning, combines the sample efficiency of in-context learning with the performance gains of fine-tuning, leading to a method that consistently matches and often significantly exceeds both these baselines. To perform hyperparameter selection in the low-data regime, we propose to use prequential evaluation, which eliminates the need for expensive cross-validation and leverages all available data for training while simultaneously providing a robust validation signal. We conduct an extensive empirical study to determine which adaptation paradigm - fine-tuning, in-context learning, or our proposed unified approach offers the best predictive performance on a concrete data downstream-tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u878d\u5165\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u793a\u4f8b\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u5e8f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08prequential evaluation\uff09\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e76\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6570\u636e\u589e\u591a\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u8d8b\u4e8e\u9971\u548c\u3002\u4e8c\u8005\u5404\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7c7b\u4f3ck-shot\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u9884\u5e8f\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fdb\u884c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f18\u52bf\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u5d4c\u5165\u5fae\u8c03\u6d41\u7a0b\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u517c\u987e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e0e\u5145\u8db3\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u662f\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u914d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, the principles behind inference time scaling are not well understood. In this paper, we introduce an analytically tractable model of inference-time scaling: Bayesian linear regression with a reward-weighted sampler, where the reward is determined from a linear model, modeling LLM-as-a-judge scenario. We study this problem in the high-dimensional regime, where the deterministic equivalents dictate a closed-form expression for the posterior predictive mean and variance. We analyze the generalization error when training data are sampled from a teacher model. We draw $k$ inference-time samples and select via softmax at a temperature applied to a quadratic reward. When the reward is not too different from the teacher, the generalization error decreases monotonically with increasing inference time samples $k$. However, the specific reward that optimizes inference-time selection generally differs from the teacher. In contrast, substantial reward misspecification induces a finite optimal $k$ beyond which more sampling can increase the generalization error. For fixed $k$, there exists an optimal sampling temperature. We experimentally verify these facts in large language model inference with an additional large language model as a judge. In the \"best-of-$k$\" limit with the teacher as reward, we theoretically show that the generalization error decays as $\u0398(1/k^2)$ and determine the leading coefficient via extreme value theory. These formulas delineate domains where scaling inference-time computation is provably preferable to collecting more data. Finally, we demonstrate that when task difficulty increases, the previously mentioned advantage of inference-time compute degrades.", "AI": {"tldr":

Current non-ergodic GMMs rely on Gaussian Process (GP) methods with prescribed correlation functions and thus have computational limitations for large-scale predictions. This study proposes a deep-learning approach called Conditional Generative Modeling for Fourier Amplitude Spectra (CGM-FAS) as an alternative to GP-based methods for modeling non-ergodic path effects in Fourier Amplitude Spectra (FAS). CGM-FAS uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder architecture to learn spatial patterns and interfrequency correlation directly from data by using geographical coordinates of earthquakes and stations as conditional variables. Using San Francisco Bay Area earthquake data, we compare CGM-FAS against a recent GP-based GMM for the region and demonstrate consistent predictions of non-ergodic path effects. Additionally, CGM-FAS offers advantages compared to GP-based approaches in learning spatial patterns without prescribed correlation functions, capturing interfrequency correlations, and enabling rapid predictions, generating maps for 10,000 sites across 1,000 frequencies within 10 seconds using a few GB of memory. CGM-FAS hyperparameters can be tuned to ensure generated path effects exhibit variability consistent with the GP-based empirical GMM.

However, existing large-scale datasets like PubLayNet and DocBank lack fine-grained region labels and multilingual diversity, making them insufficient for representing complex document layouts. In contrast, human-annotated datasets such as M6Doc and D4LA offer richer labels and greater domain diversity, but are too small to train robust models and lack adequate multilingual coverage. This gap is especially pronounced for Indic documents, which encompass diverse scripts yet remain underrepresented in current datasets, further limiting progress in this space. To address these shortcomings, we introduce IndicDLP, a large-scale foundational document layout dataset spanning 11 representative Indic languages alongside English and 12 common document domains. Additionally, we curate UED-mini, a dataset derived from DocLayNet and M6Doc, to enhance pretraining and provide a solid foundation for Indic layout models. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning existing English models on IndicDLP significantly boosts performance, validating its effectiveness. Moreover, models trained on IndicDLP generalize well beyond Indic layouts, making it a valuable resource for document digitization.

While scaling laws drove significant improvements in general capabilities, theoretical frameworks suggest hallucination is not merely stochastic error but a predictable statistical consequence of training objectives prioritizing mimicking data distribution over epistemic honesty. Standard RLVR paradigms, utilizing binary reward signals, inadvertently incentivize models as good test-takers rather than honest communicators, encouraging guessing whenever correctness probability exceeds zero. This paper presents an exhaustive investigation into behavioral calibration, which incentivizes models to stochastically admit uncertainty by abstaining when not confident, aligning model behavior with accuracy. Synthesizing recent advances, we propose and evaluate training interventions optimizing strictly proper scoring rules for models to output a calibrated probability of correctness. Our methods enable models to either abstain from producing a complete response or flag individual claims where uncertainty remains.

However, existing methods often depend on explicit degradation priors (e.g., degradation labels) as prompts to guide restoration, which are difficult to obtain due to complex and mixed degradations in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-Aware Metric Prompting (DAMP) framework. Instead of relying on predefined degradation priors, we design spatial-spectral degradation metrics to continuously quantify multi-dimensional degradations, serving as Degradation Prompts (DP). These DP enable the model to capture cross-task similarities in degradation distributions and enhance shared feature learning. Furthermore, we introduce a Spatial-Spectral Adaptive Module (SSAM) that dynamically modulates spatial and spectral feature extraction through learnable parameters. By integrating SSAM as experts within a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, and using DP as the gating router, the framework enables adaptive, efficient, and robust restoration under diverse, mixed, or unseen degradations. Extensive experiments on natural and remote sensing HSI datasets show that DAMP achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates exceptional generalization capability.

Addressing these with simulations is hindered by their massive scale, both in synthetic data volumes and numerical complexity, while real-data efforts are constrained by models that inadequately reflect the Earth's complexity and by sparse sensor measurements from the field. Recent machine learning (ML) efforts offer promise, but progress is obscured by a lack of proper characterization, fair reporting, and rigorous comparisons. To address this, we introduce a Common Task Framework (CTF) for ML for seismic wavefields, starting with three distinct wavefield datasets. Our CTF features a curated set of datasets at various scales (global, crustal, and local) and task-specific metrics spanning forecasting, reconstruction, and generalization under realistic constraints such as noise and limited data. Inspired by CTFs in fields like natural language processing, this framework provides a structured and rigorous foundation for head-to-head algorithm evaluation. We illustrate the evaluation procedure with scores reported for two of the datasets, showcasing the performance of various methods and foundation models for reconstructing seismic wavefields from both simulated and real-world sensor measurements. The CTF scores reveal the strengths, limitations, and suitability for specific problem classes.

However, it has long faced the challenges of high inter-class similarity and large intra-class variability. Existing approaches often struggle to effectively inject abstract yet strongly discriminative semantic knowledge into pixel-level feature learning, leading to blurred boundaries and class confusion in complex scenes. To address these challenges, we propose Bidirectional Co-Refinement Framework for HRSS (BiCoR-Seg). Specifically, we design a Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy Module (HBIS), which establishes a bidirectional information flow between feature maps and class embeddings by generating class-level heatmaps. Based on HBIS, we further introduce a hierarchical supervision strategy, where the interpretable heatmaps generated by each HBIS module are directly utilized as low-resolution segmentation predictions for supervision, thereby enhancing the discriminative capacity of shallow features. In addition, to further improve the discriminability of the embedding representations, we propose a cross-layer class embedding Fisher Discriminative Loss to enforce intra-class compactness and enlarge inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA, Vaihingen, and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that BiCoR-Seg achieves outstanding segmentation performance while offering stronger interpretability.

This work introduces Conditional Adversarial Fragility, a regime dependent phenomenon in which adversarial vulnerability is systematically amplified during periods of macroeconomic stress. We propose a regime aware evaluation framework for time indexed tabular financial classification tasks that conditions robustness assessment on external indicators of economic stress. Using volatility based regime segmentation as a proxy for macroeconomic conditions, we evaluate model behavior across calm and stress periods while holding model architecture, attack methodology, and evaluation protocols constant. Baseline predictive performance remains comparable across regimes, indicating that economic stress alone does not induce inherent performance degradation. Under adversarial perturbations, however, models operating during stress regimes exhibit substantially greater degradation across predictive accuracy, operational decision thresholds, and risk sensitive outcomes. We further demonstrate that this amplification propagates to increased false negative rates, elevating the risk of missed high risk cases during adverse conditions. To complement numerical robustness metrics, we introduce an interpretive governance layer based on semantic auditing of model explanations using large language models. Together, these results demonstrate that adversarial robustness in financial machine learning is a regime dependent property and motivate stress aware approaches to model risk assessment in high stakes financial deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6761\u4ef6\u5bf9\u6297\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff08Conditional Adversarial Fragility\uff09\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u538b\u529b\u65f6\u671f\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u72b6\u6001\u5206\u6bb5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u671f\u4e0e\u538b\u529b\u671f\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u4e3b\u8981\u4f53\u73b0\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u57fa\u7840\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u538b\u529b\u65f6\u671f\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u6f0f\u62a5\u7387\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611f\u6307\u6807\u6076\u5316\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5ba1\u8ba1\u89e3\u91ca\u5c42\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u6cbb\u7406\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5177\u6709\u72b6\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u91c7\u7528\u538b\u529b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4f46\u91d1\u878d\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u884c\u4e8e\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u7ecf\u6d4e\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7ecf\u6d4e\u538b\u529b\u65f6\u671f\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u4e25\u91cd\u51b3\u7b56\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u8003\u8651\u5b8f\u89c2\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u72b6\u6001\u5206\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5212\u5206\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u5f0f\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e73\u9759\u671f\u4e0e\u538b\u529b\u671f\u4e0b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u5ba1\u8ba1\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u51c6\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u538b\u529b\u672c\u8eab\u4e0d\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\uff1b\u4f46\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\uff0c\u538b\u529b\u671f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u9608\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u9519\u8bef\u6f0f\u62a5\u7387\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6848\u4f8b\u88ab\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u8bed\u4e49\u5ba1\u8ba1\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u5728\u538b\u529b\u671f\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u662f\u53d7\u7ecf\u6d4e\u72b6\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u53d1\u5c55\u538b\u529b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u91d1\u878d\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

Recently, such techniques have been increasingly employed to distort narratives of important events and to spread misinformation on social media, prompting the development of misinformation detectors. In the context of misinformation conveyed through image-text pairs, several detection methods have been proposed. However, these approaches typically rely on computationally intensive architectures or require large amounts of annotated data. In this work we introduce LADLE-MM: Limited Annotation based Detector with Learned Ensembles for Multimodal Misinformation, a model-soup initialized multimodal misinformation detector designed to operate under a limited annotation setup and constrained training resources. LADLE-MM is composed of two unimodal branches and a third multimodal one that enhances image and text representations with additional multimodal embeddings extracted from BLIP, serving as fixed reference space. Despite using 60.3% fewer trainable parameters than previous state-of-the-art models, LADLE-MM achieves competitive performance on both binary and multi-label classification tasks on the DGM4 benchmark, outperforming existing methods when trained without grounding annotations. Moreover, when evaluated on the VERITE dataset, LADLE-MM outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches that utilize more complex architectures involving Large Vision-Language-Models, demonstrating the effective generalization ability in an open-set setting and strong robustness to unimodal bias.", "AI": {"tldr": "LADLE-MM \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c1160.3%\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5176\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u652f\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u878d\u5408BLIP\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u4e09\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5bf9\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u65e0\u63a5\u5730\u6807\u6ce8\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u5177\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u865a\u5047\u5185\u5bb9\u65e5\u76ca\u6cdb\u6ee5\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa LADLE-MM \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u652f\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408 BLIP \u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u4e09\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u652f\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u6c64\uff08model-soup\uff09\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728 DGM4 \u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11 60.3%\uff0c\u4ecd\u8fbe\u5230\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u65e0\u63a5\u5730\u6807\u6ce8\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5728 VERITE \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LADLE-MM \u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u5c11\u6807\u6ce8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa${D}^{3}$ETOR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u4f2a\u88c5\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u71b5\u9a71\u52a8\u70b9\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347SAM\u5728COD\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5165FADeNet\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u591a\u5c42\u7ea7\u9891\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u76d1\u7763\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u6807\u6ce8\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u9886\u5148\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u4f2a\u88c5\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u8d28\u91cf\u4f4e\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u504f\u89c1\u672a\u88ab\u8003\u8651\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u6807\u6ce8\u504f\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a(1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u71b5\u9a71\u52a8\u70b9\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3aSAM\u5728COD\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff1b(2) \u8bbe\u8ba1FADeNet\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u76d1\u7763\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3scribble\u6807\u6ce8\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "${D}^{3}$ETOR\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5229\u7528\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0e\u8349\u56fe\u8bed\u4e49\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u4f2a\u88c5\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

This progress is driven by increasingly sophisticated model architectures, such as ResNets, Vision Transformers, and Hybrid Convolutional Neural Networks, that offer enhanced performance at the cost of greater complexity. This complexity often compromises model explainability and interpretability. SHAP has emerged as a prominent method for providing interpretable visualizations that aid domain experts in understanding model predictions. However, SHAP explanations can be unstable and unreliable in the presence of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. In this study, we address this challenge by using Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify the uncertainty that arises from these unstable explanations in medical imaging applications. The framework uses a belief, plausible, and fusion map approach alongside statistical quantitative analysis to produce quantification of uncertainty in SHAP. Furthermore, we evaluated our framework on three medical imaging datasets with varying class distributions, image qualities, and modality types which introduces noise due to varying image resolutions and modality-specific aspect covering the examples from pathology, ophthalmology, and radiology, introducing significant epistemic uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u72c4\u5229\u514b\u96f7\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u8fbe\u59c6\u65af-\u8c22\u5f17\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2dSHAP\u89e3\u91ca\u56e0\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u968f\u673a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u5ff5\u3001\u4f3c\u7136\u548c\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6a21\u6001\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "SHAP\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5e2e\u52a9\u4e13\u5bb6\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u968f\u673a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65f6\u89e3\u91ca\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6709\u6548\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u72c4\u5229\u514b\u96f7\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u8fbe\u59c6\u65af-\u8c22\u5f17\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4fe1\u5ff5\u3001\u4f3c\u7136\u548c\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8f85\u4ee5\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5bf9SHAP\u89e3\u91ca\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u6db5\u76d6\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u3001\u773c\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u7531\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u663e\u8457\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Existing deep forecasting models typically supervise predictions using full-length temporal windows, which include substantial high-frequency noise and obscure long-term trends. Moreover, auxiliary variables containing rich domain-specific information are often underutilized, especially in few-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose LoFT-LLM, a frequency-aware forecasting pipeline that integrates low-frequency learning with semantic calibration via a large language model (LLM). Firstly, a Patch Low-Frequency forecasting Module (PLFM) extracts stable low-frequency trends from localized spectral patches. Secondly, a residual learner then models high-frequency variations. Finally, a fine-tuned LLM refines the predictions by incorporating auxiliary context and domain knowledge through structured natural language prompts.

With the ultimate goal of building human-like conversational systems, recent studies have explored talking or listening head generation as well as conversational speech generation. However, these works are typically studied in isolation, overlooking the multimodal nature of human conversation, which involves tightly coupled audio-visual interactions. In this paper, we introduce TAVID, a unified framework that generates both interactive faces and conversational speech in a synchronized manner. TAVID integrates face and speech generation pipelines through two cross-modal mappers (i.e., a motion mapper and a speaker mapper), which enable bidirectional exchange of complementary information between the audio and visual modalities. We evaluate our system across four dimensions: talking face realism, listening head responsiveness, dyadic interaction fluency, and speech quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across all these aspects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTAVID\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bed\u97f3\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6620\u5c04\u5668\uff08\u8fd0\u52a8\u6620\u5c04\u5668\u548c\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u6620\u5c04\u5668\uff09\u5c06\u9762\u90e8\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u6362\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u751f\u6210\u540c\u6b65\u4e14\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u3001\u4e92\u52a8\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u8d28\u91cf\u56db\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u5e38\u5b64\u7acb\u5730\u5904\u7406\u8bf4\u8bdd\u5934\u751f\u6210\u6216\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bed\u97f3\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u9762\u90e8\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u97f3\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "TAVID\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8fd0\u52a8\u6620\u5c04\u5668\u548c\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u6620\u5c04\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u97f3\u9891\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u3002\u8fd0\u52a8\u6620\u5c04\u5668\u5c06\u8bed\u97f3\u7279\u5f81\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u6620\u5c04\u5668\u5219\u5c06\u9762\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u53cd\u5411\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u8bed\u97f3\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u786e\u4fdd\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u540c\u6b65\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\uff0cTAVID\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff1a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u8138\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\uff0c\u542c\u5934\u53cd\u5e94\u7075\u654f\uff0c\u53cc\u4eba\u4e92\u52a8\u6d41\u7545\u81ea\u7136\uff0c\u8bed\u97f3\u8d28\u91cf\u9ad8\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TAVID\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4eba\u673a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u4ea4\u4e92\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Unke", "Arnaud Doucet"], "title": "Control Variate Score Matching for Diffusion Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Diffusion models offer a robust framework for sampling from unnormalized probability densities, which requires accurately estimating the score of the noise-perturbed target distribution. While the standard Denoising Score Identity (DSI) relies on data samples, access to the target energy function enables an alternative formulation via the Target Score Identity (TSI). However, these estimators face a fundamental variance trade-off: DSI exhibits high variance in low-noise regimes, whereas TSI suffers from high variance at high noise levels. In this work, we reconcile these approaches by unifying both estimators within the principled framework of control variates. We introduce the Control Variate Score Identity (CVSI), deriving an optimal, time-dependent control coefficient that theoretically guarantees variance minimization across the entire noise spectrum. We demonstrate that CVSI serves as a robust, low-variance plug-in estimator that significantly enhances sample efficiency in both data-free sampler learning and inference-time diffusion sampling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\u5206\u6570\u6052\u7b49\u5f0f\uff08CVSI\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u6807\u51c6\u53bb\u566a\u5206\u6570\u6052\u7b49\u5f0f\uff08DSI\uff09\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u6570\u6052\u7b49\u5f0f\uff08TSI\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5168\u566a\u58f0\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u5dee\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u53d8\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u5173\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982DSI\u5728\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u533a\u57df\u65b9\u5dee\u9ad8\uff0c\u800cTSI\u5728\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u533a\u57df\u65b9\u5dee\u5927\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u517c\u987e\u5168\u566a\u58f0\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06DSI\u4e0eTSI\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6574\u4f53\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u65f6\u53d8\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u566a\u58f0\u8c31\u4e0b\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u3002", "result": "CVSI\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u573a\u666f\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "CVSI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u5b8c\u5907\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u5206\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u6837\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

They also incur high computational costs due to additional interaction modules introduced into DiTs, while the limited scale and quality of existing public datasets also restrict model generalization and effective training. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, KeyTailor, along with a large-scale, high-definition dataset, ViT-HD. The core idea of KeyTailor is a keyframe-driven details injection strategy, motivated by the fact that keyframes inherently contain both foreground dynamics and background consistency. Specifically, KeyTailor adopts an instruction-guided keyframe sampling strategy to filter informative frames from the input video. Subsequently,two tailored keyframe-driven modules, the garment details enhancement module and the collaborative background optimization module, are employed to distill garment dynamics into garment-related latents and to optimize the integrity of background latents, both guided by keyframes.These enriched details are then injected into standard DiT blocks together with pose, mask, and noise latents, enabling efficient and realistic try-on video synthesis. This design ensures consistency without explicitly modifying the DiT architecture, while simultaneously avoiding additional complexity. In addition, our dataset ViT-HD comprises 15, 070 high-quality video samples at a resolution of 810*1080, covering diverse garments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KeyTailor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of garment fidelity and background integrity across both dynamic and static scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "KeyTailor\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u6ce8\u5165\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u670d\u88c5\u7ec6\u8282\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u7a7f\u4e2d\u670d\u88c5\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u6e05\u6570\u636e\u96c6ViT-HD\uff0815,070\u4e2a810\u00d71080\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c6\u9891\u6837\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u5c0f\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539DiT\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u5f15\u5bfc\u6ce8\u5165\u589e\u5f3a\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08DiT\uff09\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u7a7f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6355\u6349\u7cbe\u7ec6\u670d\u88c5\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u80cc\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u56e0\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5757\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u6709\u9650\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u9ad8\uff0c\u5236\u7ea6\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faKeyTailor\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6307\u4ee4\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u7b5b\u9009\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u5e27\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u2014\u2014\u670d\u88c5\u7ec6\u8282\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\u4e0e\u534f\u540c\u80cc\u666f\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4ece\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5e76\u6ce8\u5165\u670d\u88c5\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u81f3\u6807\u51c6DiT\u5757\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u59ff\u6001\u3001\u63a9\u7801\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u9759\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u670d\u88c5\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684ViT-HD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u6837\u5316\u670d\u88c5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "KeyTailor\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6ce8\u5165\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8DiT\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u7a7f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u670d\u88c5\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While deep learning excels in feature extraction, its performance still deteriorates under imbalanced data. In this work, we propose a novel activation function, named OGAB, designed to alleviate class imbalance in deep learning classifiers. OGAB incorporates orthogonality and group-aware bias learning to enhance feature distinguishability in imbalanced scenarios without explicitly requiring label information. Our key insight is that activation functions can be used to introduce strong inductive biases that can address complex data challenges beyond traditional non-linearity. Our work demonstrates that orthogonal transformations can preserve information about minority classes by maintaining feature independence, thereby preventing the dominance of majority classes in the embedding space. Further, the proposed group-aware bias mechanism automatically identifies data clusters and adjusts embeddings to enhance class separability without the need for explicit supervision. Unlike existing approaches that address class imbalance through preprocessing data modifications or post-processing corrections, our proposed approach tackles class imbalance during the training phase at the embedding learning level, enabling direct integration with the learning process.

In this work, we give the general form of an optimal policy for learning controllable dynamics in an unknown environment by exploring over a limited time horizon. This policy is simple to implement and efficient to compute, and allows an agent to ``learn by exploring\" as it maximizes its information gain in a greedy fashion by selecting controls from a constraint set that changes over time during exploration. We give a simple parameterization for the set of controls, and present an algorithm for finding an optimal policy. The reason for this policy is due to the existence of certain types of states that restrict control of the dynamics; such as transient states, absorbing states, and non-backtracking states. We show why the occurrence of these states makes a non-stationary policy essential for achieving optimal exploration. Six interesting examples of controllable dynamics are treated in detail. Policy optimality is demonstrated using counting arguments, comparing with suboptimal policies, and by making use of a sequential improvement property from dynamic programming.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u63a2\u7d22\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u63a7\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8d2a\u5a6a\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u8c03\u6574\u63a7\u5236\u96c6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u77ac\u6001\u3001\u5438\u6536\u6001\u548c\u975e\u56de\u6eaf\u6001\u7b49\u9650\u5236\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u6700\u4f18\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u6570\u8bba\u8bc1\u3001\u4e0e\u6b21\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u6bd4\u8f83\u53ca\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u6539\u8fdb\u6027\u8d28\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u63a7\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u662f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5e73\u7a33\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u72b6\u6001\uff08\u5982\u77ac\u6001\u3001\u5438\u6536\u6001\uff09\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u96c6\u7684\u8d2a\u5a6a\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u96c6\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u6539\u8fdb\u6027\u8d28\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u6570\u8bba\u8bc1\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u516d\u7c7b\u5178\u578b\u53ef\u63a7\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u65f6\uff0c\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u5e73\u7a33\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u6613\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u77ac\u6001\u3001\u5438\u6536\u6001\u6216\u975e\u56de\u6eaf\u6001\u7b49\u9650\u5236\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u63a2\u7d22\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7406\u8bba\u4e25\u8c28\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Inspired by 3D Gaussian Splatting, recent 2D Gaussian image models improve representation efficiency, yet existing methods struggle to balance compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. To address this issue, we propose SmartSplat, a highly adaptive and feature-aware GS-based image compression framework that supports arbitrary image resolutions and compression ratios. SmartSplat leverages image-aware features such as gradients and color variances, introducing a Gradient-Color Guided Variational Sampling strategy together with an Exclusion-based Uniform Sampling scheme to improve the non-overlapping coverage of Gaussian primitives in pixel space. In addition, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Color Sampling method to enhance color initialization across scales. Through joint optimization of spatial layout, scale, and color initialization, SmartSplat efficiently captures both local structures and global textures using a limited number of Gaussians, achieving high reconstruction quality under strong compression. Extensive experiments on DIV8K and a newly constructed 16K dataset demonstrate that SmartSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods at comparable compression ratios and exceeds their compression limits, showing strong scalability and practical applicability.

DFMs have recently emerged as a new class of generative models for discrete data, offering strong performance. However, they suffer from slow sampling due to their iterative nature. Existing acceleration methods largely depend on finetuning, which introduces substantial additional training overhead. $\\texttt{PairFlow}$ addresses this issue with a lightweight preprocessing step. Inspired by ReFlow and its extension to DFMs, we train DFMs from coupled samples of source and target distributions, without requiring any pretrained teacher. At the core of our approach is a closed-form inversion for DFMs, which allows efficient construction of paired source-target samples. Despite its extremely low cost, taking only up to 1.7% of the compute needed for full model training, $\\texttt{PairFlow}$ matches or even surpasses the performance of two-stage training involving finetuning. Furthermore, models trained with our framework provide stronger base models for subsequent distillation, yielding further acceleration after finetuning.

We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives. Comprehensive experiments with downstream tasks on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDETACH\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668-\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5916\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bef\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u4e92\u76d1\u7763\u5efa\u7acb\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u518d\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a0\u6743\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5728Opportunity++\u548cHWU-USP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0e\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u7528\u6237\u4e0d\u9002\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u9650\u5236\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5916\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u6210\u4e3a\u5fc5\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5168\u5c40\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8be5\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u56e0\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u5fae\u8fd0\u52a8\uff08\u95ee\u9898P1\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6df7\u6dc6\uff08\u95ee\u9898P2\uff09\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDETACH\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u805a\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u4f20\u611f\u5668-\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bed\u4e49\u652f\u6491\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u2014\u2014\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u4e92\u76d1\u7763\u5efa\u7acb\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a0\u6743\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5904\u7406\u6613\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u3001\u96be\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u5047\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u51c6\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728Opportunity++\u548cHWU-USP\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u9002\u914d\u540e\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0-\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DETACH\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5916\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u667a\u80fd\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

It is fundamentally defined as the difference between the relaxed total energy of the adsorbate-surface system and that of an appropriate reference state; therefore, the accuracy of relaxed-energy prediction directly determines the reliability of machine-learning-driven catalyst screening. E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs) can natively operate on three-dimensional atomic coordinates under periodic boundary conditions and have demonstrated strong performance on such tasks. In contrast, language-model-based approaches, while enabling human-readable textual descriptions and reducing reliance on explicit graph -- thereby broadening applicability -- remain insufficient in both adsorption-configuration energy prediction accuracy and in distinguishing ``the same system with different configurations,'' even with graph-assisted pretraining in the style of GAP-CATBERTa.\n  To this end, we propose QE-Catalytic, a multimodal framework that deeply couples a large language model (\\textbf{Q}wen) with an E(3)-equivariant graph Transformer (\\textbf{E}quiformer-V2), enabling unified support for adsorption-configuration property prediction and inverse design on complex catalytic surfaces. During prediction, QE-Catalytic jointly leverages three-dimensional structures and structured configuration text, and injects ``3D geometric information'' into the language channel via graph-text alignment, allowing it to function as a high-performance text-based predictor when precise coordinates are unavailable, while also autoregressively generating CIF files for target-energy-driven structure design and information completion.

However, when applied to textured defect images, conventional anomaly detection methods have limitations including non-negligible misidentification, low robustness, and excessive reliance on large-scale and structured datasets. This paper proposes a texture basis integrated smooth decomposition (TBSD) approach, which is targeted at efficient anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds and sparse anomalies. Mathematical formulation of quasi-periodicity and its theoretical properties are investigated for image texture estimation. TBSD method consists of two principal processes: the first process learns the texture basis functions to effectively extract quasi-periodic texture patterns; the subsequent anomaly detection process utilizes that texture basis as prior knowledge to prevent texture misidentification and capture potential anomalies with high accuracy.The proposed method surpasses benchmarks with less misidentification, smaller training dataset requirement, and superior anomaly detection performance on both simulation and real-world datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u5e73\u6ed1\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u7eb9\u7406\u57fa\u96c6\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u5206\u89e3\uff08TBSD\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u7eb9\u7406\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u63d0\u53d6\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7eb9\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u57fa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u907f\u514d\u7eb9\u7406\u8bef\u5224\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cTBSD\u5728\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8bef\u68c0\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7eb9\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8bef\u68c0\u7387\u9ad8\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5dee\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7eb9\u7406\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u7cbe\u51c6\u8bc6\u522b\u7eb9\u7406\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u7a00\u758f\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7eb9\u7406\u57fa\u96c6\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u5206\u89e3\uff08TBSD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6316\u6398\u56fe\u50cf\u7eb9\u7406\u7684\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u7eb9\u7406\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7eb9\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5229\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u57fa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6291\u5236\u7eb9\u7406\u8bef\u5224\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5f02\u5e38\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "TBSD\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8bef\u68c0\u7387\u3001\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4ec5\u9700\u8f83\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TBSD\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7eb9\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5236\u9020\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5bf9\u7eb9\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\u8fdb\u884c\u5feb\u901f\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

This paper explores Information Directed Sampling (IDS) policies, a class of heuristics that balance immediate regret against information gain. We focus on the tractable environment of two-state Bernoulli bandits as a minimal model to rigorously compare heuristic strategies against the optimal policy. We extend the IDS framework to the discounted infinite-horizon setting by introducing a modified information measure and a tuning parameter to modulate the decision-making behavior. We examine two specific problem classes: symmetric bandits and the scenario involving one fair coin. In the symmetric case we show that IDS achieves bounded cumulative regret, whereas in the one-fair-coin scenario the IDS policy yields a regret that scales logarithmically with the horizon, in agreement with classical asymptotic lower bounds.

However, most existing methods overlook physical cues such as joint actuation forces that are fundamental in biomechanics. This gap motivates our study: if and when do physically inferred forces enhance motion understanding? By incorporating forces into established motion understanding pipelines, we systematically evaluate their impact across baseline models on 3 major tasks: gait recognition, action recognition, and fine-grained video captioning. Across 8 benchmarks, incorporating forces yields consistent performance gains; for example, on CASIA-B, Rank-1 gait recognition accuracy improved from 89.52% to 90.39% (+0.87), with larger gain observed under challenging conditions: +2.7% when wearing a coat and +3.0% at the side view. On Gait3D, performance also increases from 46.0% to 47.3% (+1.3). In action recognition, CTR-GCN achieved +2.00% on Penn Action, while high-exertion classes like punching/slapping improved by +6.96%. Even in video captioning, Qwen2.5-VL's ROUGE-L score rose from 0.310 to 0.339 (+0.029), indicating that physics-inferred forces enhance temporal grounding and semantic richness.

However, offline RL faces the distribution shift problem. The policy constraint offline RL method is proposed to solve the distribution shift problem. During the policy constraint offline RL training, it is important to ensure the difference between the learned policy and behavior policy within a given threshold. Thus, the learned policy heavily relies on the quality of the behavior policy. However, a problem exists in existing policy constraint methods: if the dataset contains many low-reward transitions, the learned will be contained with a suboptimal reference policy, leading to slow learning speed, low sample efficiency, and inferior performances. This paper shows that the sampling method in policy constraint offline RL that uses all the transitions in the dataset can be improved. A simple but efficient sample filtering method is proposed to improve the sample efficiency and the final performance. First, we evaluate the score of the transitions by average reward and average discounted reward of episodes in the dataset and extract the transition samples of high scores. Second, the high-score transition samples are used to train the offline RL algorithms. We verify the proposed method in a series of offline RL algorithms and benchmark tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6837\u672c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u6298\u6263\u5e73\u5747\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa\u9ad8\u5206\u6837\u672c\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u7ea6\u675f\u578b\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b\u5927\u91cf\u4f4e\u56de\u62a5\u8f6c\u79fb\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u53d7\u5230\u6b21\u4f18\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u4e60\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u3001\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u6bcf\u6761\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u6298\u6263\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u5f97\u5206\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa\u9ad8\u5206\u8f6c\u79fb\u6837\u672c\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u8bad\u7ec3\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u5f97\u5206\u7684\u6837\u672c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u56e0\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

While diffusion-based text-to-image models have demonstrated strong capabilities in visual content generation, their text rendering performance, particularly for small-scale typography and non-Latin scripts, remains limited. In this paper, we propose UTDesign, a unified framework for high-precision stylized text editing and conditional text generation in design images, supporting both English and Chinese scripts. Our framework introduces a novel DiT-based text style transfer model trained from scratch on a synthetic dataset, capable of generating transparent RGBA text foregrounds that preserve the style of reference glyphs. We further extend this model into a conditional text generation framework by training a multi-modal condition encoder on a curated dataset with detailed text annotations, enabling accurate, style-consistent text synthesis conditioned on background images, prompts, and layout specifications. Finally, we integrate our approach into a fully automated text-to-design (T2D) pipeline by incorporating pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models and an MLLM-based layout planner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UTDesign achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods in terms of stylistic consistency and text accuracy, and also exhibits unique advantages compared to proprietary commercial approaches.

This research evaluates adaptive Red-Green-Blue (RGB) and Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) fusion for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)-based detection of surface-laid landmines, leveraging the thermal contrast between the ordnance and the surrounding soil to enhance feature extraction. Using You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures (v8, v10, v11) across 114 test images, generating 35,640 model-condition evaluations, YOLOv11 achieved optimal performance (86.8% mAP), with 10 to 30% thermal fusion at 5 to 10m altitude identified as the optimal detection parameters. A complementary architectural comparison revealed that while RF-DETR achieved the highest accuracy (69.2% mAP), followed by Faster R-CNN (67.6%), YOLOv11 (64.2%), and RetinaNet (50.2%), YOLOv11 trained 17.7 times faster than the transformer-based RF-DETR (41 minutes versus 12 hours), presenting a critical accuracy-efficiency tradeoff for operational deployment. Aggregated multi-temporal training datasets outperformed season-specific approaches by 1.8 to 9.6%, suggesting that models benefit from exposure to diverse thermal conditions. Anti-Tank (AT) mines achieved 61.9% detection accuracy, compared with 19.2% for Anti-Personnel (AP) mines, reflecting both the size differential and thermal-mass differences between these ordnance classes. As this research examined surface-laid mines where thermal contrast is maximized, future research should quantify thermal contrast effects for mines buried at varying depths across heterogeneous soil types.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\uff08UAS\uff09\u7684\u8868\u9762\u5e03\u8bbe\u5730\u96f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ea2\u7eff\u84dd\uff08RGB\uff09\u4e0e\u957f\u6ce2\u7ea2\u5916\uff08LWIR\uff09\u878d\u5408\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f39\u836f\u4e0e\u5468\u56f4\u571f\u58e4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u70ed\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728114\u5f20\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528YOLO\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\uff08v8\u3001v10\u3001v11\uff09\u8fdb\u884c35,640\u6b21\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cYOLOv11\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff08mAP 86.8%\uff09\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u68c0\u6d4b\u53c2\u6570\u4e3a5\u201310\u7c73\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0b10%\u81f330%\u7684\u70ed\u878d\u5408\u3002\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1RF-DETR\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\uff0869.2% mAP\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u4e3aFaster R-CNN\uff0867.6%\uff09\u3001YOLOv11\uff0864.2%\uff09\u548cRetinaNet\uff0850.2%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46YOLOv11\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684RF-DETR\u5feb17.7\u500d\uff0841\u5206\u949f\u5bf912\u5c0f\u65f6\uff09\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u4e86\u64cd\u4f5c\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6-\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\u3002\u7efc\u5408\u591a\u65f6\u76f8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd51.8%\u81f39.6%\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u591a\u6837\u5316\u70ed\u6761\u4ef6\u4e2d\u53d7\u76ca\u3002\u53cd\u5766\u514b\uff08AT\uff09\u5730\u96f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a61.9%\uff0c\u8fdc\u9ad8\u4e8e\u53cd\u4eba\u5458\uff08AP\uff09\u5730\u96f7\u768419.2%\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u51fa\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4e0e\u70ed\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u70ed\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u6700\u5927\u7684\u8868\u9762\u5730\u96f7\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u57cb\u6df1\u53ca\u5f02\u8d28\u571f\u58e4\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u70ed\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u5730\u96f7\u4ecd\u662f\u5168\u7403\u4eba\u9053\u4e3b\u4e49\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u624b\u6bb5\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u9690\u853d\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u878d\u5408\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u70ed\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u5730\u5f62\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5730\u96f7\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94RGB-LWIR\u56fe\u50cf\u878d\u5408\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408YOLOv8/v10/v11\u3001RF-DETR\u3001Faster R-CNN\u3001RetinaNet\u7b49\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728114\u5f20\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u5f00\u5c55\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08\u517135,640\u6b21\uff09\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u70ed\u878d\u5408\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0810%-30%\uff09\u4e0e\u98de\u884c\u9ad8\u5ea6\uff085-10\u7c73\uff09\u5bf9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u65f6\u76f8\u4e0e\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "YOLOv11\u572886.8% mAP\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff1b\u70ed\u878d\u5408\u6bd4\u4f8b10%-30%\u3001\u98de\u884c\u9ad8\u5ea65-10\u7c73\u4e3a\u6700\u4f18\u53c2\u6570\u7ec4\u5408\uff1b\u591a\u65f6\u76f8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8f83\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u53471.8%-9.6%\uff1b\u53cd\u5766\u514b\u5730\u96f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0861.9%\uff09\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u53cd\u4eba\u5458\u5730\u96f7\uff0819.2%\uff09\uff1bYOLOv11\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4RF-DETR\u5feb17.7\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684RGB-LWIR\u878d\u5408\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u8868\u9762\u5730\u96f7\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dYOLOv11\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u65f6\u76f8\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u70ed\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u57cb\u85cf\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u571f\u58e4\u7c7b\u578b\u5bf9\u70ed\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

They are a primary tool to quantify the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity and assess associated risks for food security. Despite decades of development, state-of-the-art GGCMs still have substantial uncertainties in simulating complex biophysical processes due to limited process understanding. Recently, machine learning approaches trained on observational data have shown great potential in crop yield predictions. However, these models have not demonstrated improved performance over classical GGCMs and are not suitable for simulating crop yields under changing climate conditions due to problems in generalizing outside their training distributions. Here we introduce NeuralCrop, a hybrid GGCM that combines the strengths of an advanced process-based GGCM, resolving important processes explicitly, with data-driven machine learning components. The model is first trained to emulate a competitive GGCM before it is fine-tuned on observational data. We show that NeuralCrop outperforms state-of-the-art GGCMs across site-level and large-scale cropping regions. Across moisture conditions, NeuralCrop reproduces the interannual yield anomalies in European wheat regions and the US Corn Belt more accurately during the period from 2000 to 2019 with particularly strong improvements under drought extremes. When generalizing to conditions unseen during training, NeuralCrop continues to make robust projections, while pure machine learning models exhibit substantial performance degradation. Our results show that our hybrid crop modelling approach offers overall improved crop modeling and more reliable yield projections under climate change and intensifying extreme weather conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeuralCrop is a hybrid crop model combining process-based GGCMs with machine learning, trained to emulate a competitive GGCM and fine-tuned on observational data.

We organize the work into five chapters, each addressing unique challenges in multimodal machine learning.\n  Chapter 3 introduces Spatial-Reasoning Bert for translating text-based spatial relations into 2D arrangements between clip-arts. This enables effective decoding of spatial language into visual representations, paving the way for automated scene generation aligned with human spatial understanding.\n  Chapter 4 presents a method for translating medical texts into specific 3D locations within an anatomical atlas. We introduce a loss function leveraging spatial co-occurrences of medical terms to create interpretable mappings, significantly enhancing medical text navigability.\n  Chapter 5 tackles translating structured text into canonical facts within knowledge graphs. We develop a benchmark for linking natural language to entities and predicates, addressing ambiguities in text extraction to provide clearer, actionable insights.\n  Chapter 6 explores multimodal fusion methods for compositional action recognition.

Existing Byzantine-robust methods focus primarily on model accuracy while overlooking the economic implications of data transfer across cloud providers. This paper presents Cost-TrustFL, a hierarchical federated learning framework that jointly optimizes model performance and communication costs while providing robust defense against poisoning attacks. We propose a gradient-based approximate Shapley value computation method that reduces the complexity from exponential to linear, enabling lightweight reputation evaluation. Our cost-aware aggregation strategy prioritizes intra-cloud communication to minimize expensive cross-cloud data transfers. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST datasets demonstrate that Cost-TrustFL achieves 86.7% accuracy under 30% malicious clients while reducing communication costs by 32% compared to baseline methods.

Accurate load forecasting is a challenging problem due to the inherent uncertainties in load demand, dynamic changes in consumption patterns, and correlations among entities. Multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful machine learning approach that enables the simultaneous learning across multiple related problems. However, its application to load forecasting remains underexplored and is limited to offline learning-based methods, which cannot capture changes in consumption patterns. This paper presents an adaptive multi-task learning method for probabilistic load forecasting. The proposed method can dynamically adapt to changes in consumption patterns and correlations among entities. In addition, the techniques presented provide reliable probabilistic predictions for loads of multiples entities and assess load uncertainties. Specifically, the method is based on vectorvalued hidden Markov models and uses a recursive process to update the model parameters and provide predictions with the most recent parameters. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using datasets that contain the load demand of multiple entities and exhibit diverse and dynamic consumption patterns. The experimental results show that the presented techniques outperform existing methods both in terms of forecasting performance and uncertainty assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u5b9e\u4f53\uff08\u5982\u533a\u57df\u3001\u5efa\u7b51\uff09\u7684\u8d1f\u8377\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5411\u91cf\u503c\u9690\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u6d88\u8d39\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8d1f\u8377\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u6d88\u8d39\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5411\u91cf\u503c\u9690\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9012\u5f52\u8fc7\u7a0b\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u591a\u5b9e\u4f53\u8d1f\u8377\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u591a\u6837\u5316\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6d88\u8d39\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u8d1f\u8377\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

A core challenge lies in effectively handling disparities in dynamic range and focus depth between the inputs. With the advent of vision-language models, recent methods incorporate textual descriptions as auxiliary guidance to enhance fusion quality. However, simply incorporating coarse-grained descriptions hampers the understanding of fine-grained details and poses challenges for precise cross-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-grained Text-guided Image Fusion (MTIF), a novel fusion paradigm with three key designs. First, it introduces multi-grained textual descriptions that separately capture fine details, structural cues, and semantic content, guiding image fusion through a hierarchical cross-modal modulation module. Second, it involves supervision signals at each granularity to facilitate alignment between visual and textual features and enhance the utility of auxiliary text. Third, it adopts a saliency-driven enrichment module to augment training data with dense semantic content, further strengthening the cross-modal modulation and alignment. Extensive experiments show that MTIF consistently outperforms previous methods on both multi-exposure and multi-focus image fusion tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08MTIF\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8c03\u5236\u4e0e\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u878d\u5408\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u8457\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\u4ee5\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bad\u7ec3\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u591a\u66dd\u5149\u548c\u591a\u7126\u70b9\u878d\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u8282\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u878d\u5408\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8c03\u5236\u6a21\u5757\uff1b\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7c92\u5ea6\u5c42\u7ea7\u5f15\u5165\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9-\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u663e\u8457\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\u6269\u5145\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u66dd\u5149\u548c\u591a\u7126\u70b9\u56fe\u50cf\u878d\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cMTIF consistently \u8d85\u8fc7\u5df2\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "MTIF \u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u878d\u5408\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u4e0e\u805a\u7126\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u878d\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We empirically demonstrate that samplers for diffusion models -- commonly optimized for sample quality and speed -- have a significant and measurable effect on bias amplification. Through controlled studies with models trained on Biased MNIST, Multi-Color MNIST and BFFHQ, and with Stable Diffusion, we show that sampling hyperparameters can induce both bias reduction and amplification, even when the trained model is fixed.

Submitted to ICPR 2026", "summary": "Multimodal brain decoding aims to reconstruct semantic information that is consistent with visual stimuli from brain activity signals such as fMRI, and then generate readable natural language descriptions. However, multimodal brain decoding still faces key challenges in cross-subject generalization and interpretability. We propose a BrainROI model and achieve leading-level results in brain-captioning evaluation on the NSD dataset. Under the cross-subject setting, compared with recent state-of-the-art methods and representative baselines, metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr show clear improvements. Firstly, to address the heterogeneity of functional brain topology across subjects, we design a new fMRI encoder. We use multi-atlas soft functional parcellations (soft-ROI) as a shared space. We extend the discrete ROI Concatenation strategy in MINDLLM to a voxel-wise gated fusion mechanism (Voxel-gate). We also ensure consistent ROI mapping through global label alignment, which enhances cross-subject transferability. Secondly, to overcome the limitations of manual and black-box prompting methods in stability and transparency, we introduce an interpretable prompt optimization process.

Existing token reduction methods often ignore the textual query or rely on deep attention maps, whose instability under aggressive pruning leads to degraded semantic alignment.\n  We propose FlashVLM, a text guided visual token selection framework that dynamically adapts visual inputs to the query. Instead of relying on noisy attention weights, FlashVLM computes an explicit cross modal similarity between projected image tokens and normalized text embeddings in the language model space. This extrinsic relevance is fused with intrinsic visual saliency using log domain weighting and temperature controlled sharpening. In addition, a diversity preserving partition retains a minimal yet representative set of background tokens to maintain global context.\n  Under identical token budgets and evaluation protocols, FlashVLM achieves beyond lossless compression, slightly surpassing the unpruned baseline while pruning up to 77.8 percent of visual tokens on LLaVA 1.5, and maintaining 92.8 percent accuracy even under 94.4 percent compression.

Motivated by this gap, we empirically study how misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations can limit the effectiveness of imitation learning. More precisely, experts have significantly higher visibility (e.g., ignoring occlusions) and far lower uncertainty (e.g., knowing other vehicles' actions), making them difficult to imitate reliably. Furthermore, navigational intent (i.e., the route to follow) is under-specified in student models at test time via only a single target point. We demonstrate that these asymmetries can measurably limit driving performance in CARLA and offer practical interventions to address them. After careful modifications to narrow the gaps between expert and student, our TransFuser v6 (TFv6) student policy achieves a new state of the art on all major publicly available CARLA closed-loop benchmarks, reaching 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13. Additionally, by integrating perception supervision from our dataset into a shared sim-to-real pipeline, we show consistent gains on the NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End driving benchmarks.

Recent advances suggest that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) offer a promising solution to learning the complex path distributions induced by SDEs. However, a critical bottleneck lies in designing a discriminator that faithfully captures temporal dependencies while remaining computationally efficient. Prior works have explored Neural Controlled Differential Equations (CDEs) as discriminators due to their ability to model continuous-time dynamics, but such architectures suffer from high computational costs and exacerbate the instability of adversarial training. To address these limitations, we introduce HGAN-SDEs, a novel GAN-based framework that leverages Neural Hermite functions to construct a structured and efficient discriminator. Hermite functions provide an expressive yet lightweight basis for approximating path-level dynamics, enabling both reduced runtime complexity and improved training stability. We establish the universal approximation property of our framework for a broad class of SDE-driven distributions and theoretically characterize its convergence behavior. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world systems demonstrate that HGAN-SDEs achieve superior sample quality and learning efficiency compared to existing generative models for SDEs", "AI": {"tldr": "HGAN-SDEs \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e GAN \u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528 Neural Hermite \u51fd\u6570\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u5224\u522b\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5efa\u6a21 SDE \u8def\u5f84\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u96be\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u901a\u7528\u903c\u8fd1\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709 GAN \u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60 SDE \u8def\u5f84\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\uff0c\u5224\u522b\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u517c\u987e\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e CDE \u7684\u5224\u522b\u5668\u867d\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa HGAN-SDEs \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 Neural Hermite \u51fd\u6570\u6784\u9020\u5224\u522b\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528 Hermite \u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u8def\u5f84\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHGAN-SDEs \u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5bf9\u4e00\u5927\u7c7b SDE \u5206\u5e03\u5177\u6709\u901a\u7528\u903c\u8fd1\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HGAN-SDEs \u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165 Hermite \u51fd\u6570\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u5224\u522b\u5668\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf GAN \u6a21\u578b\u5728 SDE \u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Inspired by FedPIDAvg, we define a round-wise task for FedPOD to enhance training efficiency. FedPIDAvg achieved performance improvement by incorporating the training loss reduction for prediction entropy as weights using differential terms. Furthermore, by modeling data distribution with a Poisson distribution and using a PID controller, it reduced communication costs even in skewed data distribution. However, excluding participants classified as outliers based on the Poisson distribution can limit data utilization. Additionally, PID controller requires the same participants to be maintained throughout the federated learning process as it uses previous rounds' learning information in the current round. In our approach, FedPOD addresses these issues by including participants excluded as outliers, eliminating dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and applying a method for calculating validation loss at each round. In this challenge, FedPOD presents comparable performance to FedPIDAvg in metrics of Dice score, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.72 for WT, ET and TC in average, and projected convergence score, 0.74 in average. Furthermore, the concept of FedPOD draws inspiration from Kubernetes' smallest computing unit, POD, designed to be compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) have significantly improved natural language interaction with such structured data, they often fall short in handling the complex, multi-step reasoning and robust code execution required for real-world table tasks. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising avenue to enhance these capabilities, yet its application in the tabular domain faces three critical hurdles: the scarcity of high-quality agentic trajectories with closed-loop code execution and environment feedback on diverse table structures, the extreme heterogeneity of feedback signals ranging from rigid SQL execution to open-ended data interpretation, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting of general knowledge during vertical specialization. To overcome these challenges and unlock advanced reasoning on complex tables, we introduce \\textbf{TableGPT-R1}, a specialized tabular model built on a systematic RL framework. Our approach integrates a comprehensive data engineering pipeline that synthesizes difficulty-stratified agentic trajectories for both supervised alignment and RL rollouts, a task-adaptive reward system that combines rule-based verification with a criteria-injected reward model and incorporates process-level step reward shaping with behavioral regularization, and a multi-stage training framework that progressively stabilizes reasoning before specializing in table-specific tasks.

Partial client participation in FL further exacerbates this issue by skewing the aggregation of local models towards the data distribution of participating clients. This creates additional variance in the global model updates, causing the global model to converge away from the optima of the global objective. These variances lead to instability in FL training, which degrades global model performance and slows down FL training. While existing literature primarily focuses on addressing data heterogeneity, the impact of partial client participation has received less attention. In this paper, we propose FedDPC, a novel FL method, designed to improve FL training and global model performance by mitigating both data heterogeneity and partial client participation. FedDPC addresses these issues by projecting each local update onto the previous global update, thereby controlling variance in both local and global updates. To further accelerate FL training, FedDPC employs adaptive scaling for each local update before aggregation. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks with multiple heterogeneously partitioned datasets validate the effectiveness of FedDPC. The results demonstrate that FedDPC outperforms state-of-the-art FL algorithms by achieving faster reduction in training loss and improved test accuracy across communication rounds.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedDPC is a novel federated learning method that mitigates both data heterogeneity and partial client participation by projecting local updates onto the previous global update and using adaptive scaling for faster convergence and improved accuracy.", "motivation": "Data heterogeneity and partial client participation introduce variance in local and global model updates, leading to instability, poor convergence, and degraded model performance in federated learning.

Leveraging Normalizing Flows (NFs) in a teacher-student generative framework, we demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms classic data-driven model assimilation but also yields models that are 421 times faster than existing NF implementations in ZDC simulation literature.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901fALICE\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u96f6\u5ea6\u91cf\u80fd\u5668\uff08ZDC\uff09\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f93\u51fa\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u7f29\u653e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7c92\u5b50\u7c07\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u7f55\u89c1\u4f2a\u5f71\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\uff08NFs\uff09\u7684\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684NF\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe421\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u590d\u6742\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u7eaf\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u878d\u5408\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\uff08NFs\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u578b\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u53ca\u8f93\u51fa\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u7f29\u653e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u5d4c\u5165\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7c92\u5b50\u7c07\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4eff\u771f\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u73b0\u6709NF\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb421\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u7f55\u89c1\u4f2a\u5f71\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u9ad8\u80fd\u7269\u7406\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u5feb\u901f\u4eff\u771f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While this approach can generate high-quality videos, it suffers from slow convergence and is computationally expensive when generating long videos. In this paper, we introduce SemanticGen, a novel solution to address these limitations by generating videos in the semantic space. Our main insight is that, due to the inherent redundancy in videos, the generation process should begin in a compact, high-level semantic space for global planning, followed by the addition of high-frequency details, rather than directly modeling a vast set of low-level video tokens using bi-directional attention. SemanticGen adopts a two-stage generation process. In the first stage, a diffusion model generates compact semantic video features, which define the global layout of the video. In the second stage, another diffusion model generates VAE latents conditioned on these semantic features to produce the final output. We observe that generation in the semantic space leads to faster convergence compared to the VAE latent space. Our method is also effective and computationally efficient when extended to long video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemanticGen produces high-quality videos and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "SemanticGen\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1a\u5148\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u89c4\u5212\u5168\u5c40\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u518d\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u751f\u6210VAE\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u4ee5\u8f93\u51fa\u6700\u7ec8\u89c6\u9891\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728VAE\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u5efa\u6a21\u5927\u91cf\u4f4e\u7ea7\u89c6\u9891\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6536\u655b\u6162\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95ee\u9898\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u89c6\u9891\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u5e03\u5c40\u89c4\u5212\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u751f\u6210VAE\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u751f\u6210\u6700\u7ec8\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSemanticGen\u5728\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u6536\u655b\u6027\u53ca\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0cSemanticGen\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Here we introduce Field-Space attention, a mechanism for Earth system Transformers that computes attention in the physical domain rather than in a learned latent space. By maintaining all intermediate representations as continuous fields on the sphere, the architecture enables interpretable internal states and facilitates the enforcement of scientific constraints. The model employs a fixed, non-learned multiscale decomposition and learns structure-preserving deformations of the input field, allowing coherent integration of coarse and fine-scale information while avoiding the optimization instabilities characteristic of standard single-scale Vision Transformers. Applied to global temperature super-resolution on a HEALPix grid, Field-Space Transformers converge more rapidly and stably than conventional Vision Transformers and U-Net baselines, while requiring substantially fewer parameters. The explicit preservation of field structure throughout the network allows physical and statistical priors to be embedded directly into the architecture, yielding improved fidelity and reliability in data-driven Earth system modeling.

However, non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data across clients biases updates and degrades performance. To alleviate these issues, we propose Clust-PSI-PFL, a clustering-based personalized FL framework that uses the Population Stability Index (PSI) to quantify the level of non-IID data. We compute a weighted PSI metric, $WPSI^L$, which we show to be more informative than common non-IID metrics (Hellinger, Jensen-Shannon, and Earth Mover's distance). Using PSI features, we form distributionally homogeneous groups of clients via K-means++; the number of optimal clusters is chosen by a systematic silhouette-based procedure, typically yielding few clusters with modest overhead. Across six datasets (tabular, image, and text modalities), two partition protocols (Dirichlet with parameter $\u03b1$ and Similarity with parameter S), and multiple client sizes, Clust-PSI-PFL delivers up to 18% higher global accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines and markedly improves client fairness by a relative improvement of 37% under severe non-IID data. These results establish PSI-guided clustering as a principled, lightweight mechanism for robust PFL under label skew.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faClust-PSI-PFL\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u53e3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u6570\uff08PSI\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\uff08non-IID\uff09\u6570\u636e\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743PSI\uff08WPSI^L\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u975eIID\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002\u7ed3\u5408K-means++\u805a\u7c7b\u4e0e\u8f6e\u5ed3\u5206\u6790\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f18\u7c07\u6570\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7ec4\u3002\u5728\u516d\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad818%\u5168\u5c40\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u76f8\u5bf9\u6539\u558437%\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u6807\u7b7e\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u56e0\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\uff08non-IID\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u52a0\u6743\u4eba\u53e3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u6570\uff08WPSI^L\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u6570\u636e\u975eIID\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8ePSI\u7279\u5f81\u91c7\u7528K-means++\u8fdb\u884c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u805a\u7c7b\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7cfb\u6570\u6cd5\u81ea\u52a8\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f18\u805a\u7c7b\u6570\u91cf\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u5e03\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7ec4\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u8868\u683c\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6587\u672c\uff09\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u4e24\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u5212\u5206\u65b9\u5f0f\uff08Dirichlet\u548cSimilarity\uff09\u53ca\u591a\u79cd\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5168\u5c40\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534718%\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u9ad837%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u6781\u7aefnon-IID\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "PSI\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u673a\u5236\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u539f\u7406\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u5f00\u9500\u4f4e\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u6807\u7b7e\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u975eIID\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002"}}

We show that, if carefully applied, the attributes of dLLMs can actually be a strength for drafters in speculative decoding with autoregressive (AR) verifiers. Our core insight is that dLLM's speed from parallel decoding drastically lowers the risk of costly rejections, providing a practical mechanism to effectively realize the (elusive) lengthy drafts that lead to large speedups with speculative decoding. We present FailFast, a dLLM-based speculative decoding framework that realizes this approach by dynamically adapting its speculation length. It \"fails fast\" by spending minimal compute in hard-to-speculate regions to shrink speculation latency and \"wins big\" by aggressively extending draft lengths in easier regions to reduce verification latency (in many cases, speculating and accepting 70 tokens at a time!). Without any fine-tuning, FailFast delivers lossless acceleration of AR LLMs and achieves up to 4.9$\\times$ speedup over vanilla decoding, 1.7$\\times$ over the best naive dLLM drafter, and 1.4$\\times$ over EAGLE-3 across diverse models and workloads.

While designing optimal algorithms in this performative setting has recently been studied in supervised learning, the RL counterpart remains under-explored. In this paper, we prove the performative counterparts of the performance difference lemma and the policy gradient theorem in RL, and further introduce the Performative Policy Gradient algorithm (PePG). PePG is the first policy gradient algorithm designed to account for performativity in RL. Under softmax parametrisation, and also with and without entropy regularisation, we prove that PePG converges to performatively optimal policies, i.e. policies that remain optimal under the distribution shifts induced by themselves. Thus, PePG significantly extends the prior works in Performative RL that achieves performative stability but not optimality. Furthermore, our empirical analysis on standard performative RL environments validate that PePG outperforms standard policy gradient algorithms and the existing performative RL algorithms aiming for stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u56e0\u7b97\u6cd5\u90e8\u7f72\u5bfc\u81f4\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u5f15\u7406\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faPerformative Policy Gradient (PePG) \u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728softmax\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e0b\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5426\u52a0\u5165\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5747\u80fd\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u81ea\u6d3d\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5373\u5728\u81ea\u8eab\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4ee5\u5f80\u4ec5\u8ffd\u6c42\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86PePG\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u7b97\u6cd5\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7b97\u6cd5\u884c\u4e3a\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u79cd\u2018\u6027\u80fd\u6027\u2019\uff08performativity\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u5f15\u7406\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u5b9a\u7406\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6027\u7248\u672c\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5PePG\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "PePG\u5728softmax\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u53ca\u5e26/\u4e0d\u5e26\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5747\u80fd\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5728\u81ea\u6211\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u4f9d\u7136\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u8ffd\u6c42\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PePG\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u771f\u6b63\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u6027\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u7b97\u6cd5\u90e8\u7f72\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

During RL, these models explore by generating new outputs, one token at a time. However, sampling actions token-by-token can result in highly inefficient learning, particularly when rewards are sparse. Here, we show that it is possible to overcome this problem by acting and exploring within the internal representations of an autoregressive model. Specifically, to discover temporally-abstract actions, we introduce a higher-order, non-causal sequence model whose outputs control the residual stream activations of a base autoregressive model. On grid world and MuJoCo-based tasks with hierarchical structure, we find that the higher-order model learns to compress long activation sequence chunks onto internal controllers. Critically, each controller executes a sequence of behaviorally meaningful actions that unfold over long timescales and are accompanied with a learned termination condition, such that composing multiple controllers over time leads to efficient exploration on novel tasks. We show that direct internal controller reinforcement, a process we term \"internal RL\", enables learning from sparse rewards in cases where standard RL finetuning fails. Our results demonstrate the benefits of latent action generation and reinforcement in autoregressive models, suggesting internal RL as a promising avenue for realizing hierarchical RL within foundation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9ad8\u9636\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u80fd\u591f\u6267\u884c\u957f\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ec8\u6b62\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u7f51\u683c\u4e16\u754c\u548cMuJoCo\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u79f0\u4e3a\u201c\u5185\u90e8\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u201d\uff08Internal RL\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee4\u724c\u9010\u4e2a\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u9636\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236\u57fa\u7840\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff1b\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u957f\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5e8f\u5217\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u7ec8\u6b62\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u957f\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u4e16\u754c\u548cMuJoCo\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u3001\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u8de8\u5ea6\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6210\u529f\u5b8c\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfRL\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08Internal RL\uff09\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}
