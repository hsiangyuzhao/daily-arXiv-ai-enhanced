Result: FD-RL在OmniDocBench基准上取得90.41的平均得分，为当前端到端OCR模型的最佳表现；消融实验全面验证了数据、训练、过滤与奖励策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了格式化文本中高熵现象背后所反映的模型不确定性问题，证明通过引入格式解耦的强化学习框架可有效提升OCR模型在复杂文档上的泛化能力与鲁棒性，为未来文档理解系统的设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reading text from images or scanned documents via OCR models has been a longstanding focus of researchers. Intuitively, text reading is perceived as a straightforward perceptual task, and existing work primarily focuses on constructing enriched data engineering to enhance SFT capabilities. In this work, we observe that even advanced OCR models exhibit significantly higher entropy in formatted text (\emph{e.g.}, formula, table, etc.) compared to plain text, often by an order of magnitude. These statistical patterns reveal that advanced OCR models struggle with high output uncertainty when dealing with format sensitive document, suggesting that reasoning over diverse reading pathways may improve OCR performance. To address this, we propose format decoupled reinforcement learning (FD-RL), which leverages high-entropy patterns for targeted optimization. Our approach employs entropy-based data filtration strategy to identify format-intensive instances, and adopt format decoupled rewards tailored to different format types, enabling format-level validation rather than token-level memorization. FD-RL achieves an average score of 90.41 on OmniDocBench, setting a new record for end-to-end models on this highly popular benchmark. More importantly, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies over data, training, filtering, and rewarding strategies, thoroughly validating their effectiveness.

*Tarannum Mithila*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了先进视觉-语言模型和生成式图像模型在输入变换（如图像旋转和分布偏移）下的鲁棒性和公平性问题，发现旋转扰动会引发预测偏差、置信度校准失效及群体偏见加剧。为此，提出结合数据增强、表示对齐和模型正则化的旋转鲁棒性缓解策略，在多个数据集上验证了其能有效提升鲁棒性并减少偏见放大，同时保持整体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型在面对图像旋转等输入变换时表现出鲁棒性不足和公平性缺陷，尤其在敏感群体上的偏见可能被放大，亟需系统性研究与有效缓解方法。

Conclusion: 现有视觉-语言与生成式多模态模型在输入变换下存在严重的鲁棒性与公平性隐患，本文提出的综合策略为构建更可靠、公平的AI系统提供了有效路径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and generative image models have achieved remarkable performance across multimodal tasks, yet their robustness and fairness under input transformations remain insufficiently explored. This work investigates bias propagation and robustness degradation in state-of-the-art vision-language and generative models, with a particular focus on image rotation and distributional shifts. We analyze how rotation-induced perturbations affect model predictions, confidence calibration, and demographic bias patterns. To address these issues, we propose rotation-robust mitigation strategies that combine data augmentation, representation alignment, and model-level regularization. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly improve robustness while reducing bias amplification without sacrificing overall performance. This study highlights critical limitations of current multimodal systems and provides practical mitigation techniques for building more reliable and fair AI models.

### [3] [R$^2$BD: A Reconstruction-Based Method for Generalizable and Efficient Detection of Fake Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08867)
*Qingyu Liu,Zhongjie Ba,Jianmin Guo,Qiu Wang,Zhibo Wang,Jie Shi,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R$^2$BD提出一种新型伪造图像检测框架，通过G-LDM统一建模VAE、GAN和扩散模型的生成行为，并引入单步残差偏置计算模块，实现22倍以上的速度提升与更强的跨生成范式泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于重建的方法依赖扩散模型，效率低且难以泛化到GAN等其他生成模型，亟需更高效、通用的检测框架。

Method: 提出G-LDM统一重建模型以模拟多种生成模型行为，并设计单步残差偏置计算模块，实现快速检测。

Result: 在10个公开数据集上，R$^2$BD比现有方法快22倍以上，跨数据集平均性能提升13.87%，显著优于当前最优方法。

Conclusion: R$^2$BD实现了高效与强泛化性的统一，为AIGC图像检测提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recently, reconstruction-based methods have gained attention for AIGC image detection. These methods leverage pre-trained diffusion models to reconstruct inputs and measure residuals for distinguishing real from fake images. Their key advantage lies in reducing reliance on dataset-specific artifacts and improving generalization under distribution shifts. However, they are limited by significant inefficiency due to multi-step inversion and reconstruction, and their reliance on diffusion backbones further limits generalization to other generative paradigms such as GANs.
  In this paper, we propose a novel fake image detection framework, called R$^2$BD, built upon two key designs: (1) G-LDM, a unified reconstruction model that simulates the generation behaviors of VAEs, GANs, and diffusion models, thereby broadening the detection scope beyond prior diffusion-only approaches; and (2) a residual bias calculation module that distinguishes real and fake images in a single inference step, which is a significant efficiency improvement over existing methods that typically require 20$+$ steps.
  Extensive experiments on the benchmark from 10 public datasets demonstrate that R$^2$BD is over 22$\times$ faster than existing reconstruction-based methods while achieving superior detection accuracy. In cross-dataset evaluations, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 13.87\%, showing strong efficiency and generalization across diverse generative methods. The code and dataset used for evaluation are available at https://github.com/QingyuLiu/RRBD.

*Hema Hariharan Samson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ForensicFormer 提出一种分层多尺度框架，通过交叉注意力变压器统一低级伪影检测、中级边界分析和高级语义推理，在跨域伪造检测中实现86.8%的平均准确率，显著优于现有方法。该模型对JPEG压缩具有更强鲁棒性（Q=70时达83%），并能提供像素级伪造定位（F1-score 0.76）。消融实验表明各层级组件贡献4-10%的性能提升，且特征可解释性与人类专家判断一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像取证方法在面对AI生成图像和复杂编辑工具时失效，亟需一种能适应未知篡改技术的通用检测框架。

Method: 提出ForensicFormer，采用分层多尺度设计，结合交叉注意力机制，整合低级伪影、中级边界与高级语义信息进行联合推理。

Result: 在七个多样化测试集上达到86.8%平均准确率，优于现有通用检测器；在JPEG压缩下保持83%准确率（对比基线66%）；像素级定位F1-score为0.76。

Conclusion: ForensicFormer成功融合经典图像取证与现代深度学习，为未知篡改场景下的真实世界部署提供了高效、鲁棒且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated imagery and sophisticated editing tools has rendered traditional forensic methods ineffective for cross-domain forgery detection. We present ForensicFormer, a hierarchical multi-scale framework that unifies low-level artifact detection, mid-level boundary analysis, and high-level semantic reasoning via cross-attention transformers. Unlike prior single-paradigm approaches, which achieve <75% accuracy on out-of-distribution datasets, our method maintains 86.8% average accuracy across seven diverse test sets, spanning traditional manipulations, GAN-generated images, and diffusion model outputs - a significant improvement over state-of-the-art universal detectors. We demonstrate superior robustness to JPEG compression (83% accuracy at Q=70 vs. 66% for baselines) and provide pixel-level forgery localization with a 0.76 F1-score. Extensive ablation studies validate that each hierarchical component contributes 4-10% accuracy improvement, and qualitative analysis reveals interpretable forensic features aligned with human expert reasoning. Our work bridges classical image forensics and modern deep learning, offering a practical solution for real-world deployment where manipulation techniques are unknown a priori.

### [5] [Learning Domain-Invariant Representations for Cross-Domain Image Registration via Scene-Appearance Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08875)
*Jiahao Qin,Yiwen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAR-Net 是一种统一框架，通过场景-外观解耦解决域偏移下的图像配准问题。其核心思想是将图像分解为与域无关的场景表示和与域相关的外观代码，从而通过重渲染而非直接强度匹配实现配准。理论证明了该分解可实现一致的跨域对齐，并且场景一致性损失提供了几何对应关系的充分条件。在双向扫描显微镜数据上验证，SAR-Net 在保持实时性能（77 fps）的同时，达到 0.885 SSIM 和 0.979 NCC，相比最强基线提升 3.1 倍。消融实验表明，场景一致性和域对齐损失均不可或缺。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当源图像和目标图像存在系统性亮度差异时，传统配准方法依赖的亮度恒定假设被破坏，导致对应关系估计变得病态。如何在域偏移下实现鲁棒、准确的图像配准仍是计算机视觉和医学成像中的关键挑战。

Method: 提出 SAR-Net 框架，通过场景-外观解耦将图像分解为域不变的场景表示与域特定的外观编码；利用重渲染机制进行配准，避免直接强度匹配；设计场景一致性损失和域对齐损失，确保几何对应与跨域一致性。

Result: 在双向扫描显微镜数据上，SAR-Net 实现 0.885 SSIM 与 0.979 NCC，较最强基线提升 3.1 倍；保持 77 fps 实时性能；消融实验显示，移除任一损失项均导致性能显著下降：SSIM 降低 90% 或潜在对齐误差增加 223 倍。

Conclusion: SAR-Net 通过解耦场景与外观，有效应对域偏移下的图像配准难题，具备理论保障与强实证表现，为跨域图像配准提供了一种高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Image registration under domain shift remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and medical imaging: when source and target images exhibit systematic intensity differences, the brightness constancy assumption underlying conventional registration methods is violated, rendering correspondence estimation ill-posed. We propose SAR-Net, a unified framework that addresses this challenge through principled scene-appearance disentanglement. Our key insight is that observed images can be decomposed into domain-invariant scene representations and domain-specific appearance codes, enabling registration via re-rendering rather than direct intensity matching. We establish theoretical conditions under which this decomposition enables consistent cross-domain alignment (Proposition 1) and prove that our scene consistency loss provides a sufficient condition for geometric correspondence in the shared latent space (Proposition 2). Empirically, we validate SAR-Net on bidirectional scanning microscopy, where coupled domain shift and geometric distortion create a challenging real-world testbed. Our method achieves 0.885 SSIM and 0.979 NCC, representing 3.1x improvement over the strongest baseline, while maintaining real-time performance (77 fps). Ablation studies confirm that both scene consistency and domain alignment losses are necessary: removing either degrades performance by 90% SSIM or causes 223x increase in latent alignment error, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有地理空间基础模型参数量大，压缩过程中常导致精度下降，难以在资源受限的边缘设备上部署，亟需高效且保真的压缩方法。

Method: 采用流形约束优化框架DLRT，通过结构化低维参数化，将模型压缩过程与下游任务目标对齐，实现高效压缩。

Abstract: Deploying geospatial foundation models on resource-constrained edge devices demands compact architectures that maintain high downstream performance. However, their large parameter counts and the accuracy loss often induced by compression limit practical adoption. In this work, we leverage manifold-constrained optimization framework DLRT to compress large vision transformer-based geospatial foundation models during transfer learning. By enforcing structured low-dimensional parameterizations aligned with downstream objectives, this approach achieves strong compression while preserving task-specific accuracy. We show that the method outperforms of-the-shelf low-rank methods as LoRA. Experiments on diverse geospatial benchmarks confirm substantial parameter reduction with minimal accuracy loss, enabling high-performing, on-device geospatial models.

*Satyaki Roy Chowdhury,Golrokh Mirzaei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UAMSA-UNet enhances brain tumor segmentation by using uncertainty-aware multi-scale attention and a variance-penalized loss via Monte Carlo Dropout, achieving higher accuracy and lower computational cost than U-Net and U-Net++, with potential for integration with transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain tumor segmentation is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning, but existing CNN and U-Net based methods often produce noisy boundaries in tumor infiltration regions. The need for more accurate and spatially coherent segmentation masks drives the development of improved models.

Method: UAMSA-UNet employs Monte Carlo Dropout to learn a data-driven smoothing prior over predictions, integrates multi-scale features and attention maps to capture fine details and global context, and uses a smoothing-regularized loss that adds a variance penalty across stochastic forward passes to reduce spurious fluctuations.

Result: On BraTS2023, UAMSA-UNet improves Dice Similarity Coefficient by up to 3.3% and mean IoU by up to 2.7% compared to U-Net; on BraTS2024, it achieves up to 4.5% Dice and 4.0% IoU gains over the best baseline. Additionally, it reduces FLOPs by 42.5% relative to U-Net++ while maintaining higher accuracy.

Conclusion: By combining multi-scale attention with a learned smoothing prior, UAMSA-UNet achieves superior segmentation quality and computational efficiency, offering a flexible foundation for future integration with transformer-based modules to further enhance performance.

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is essential for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet many CNN and U-Net based approaches produce noisy boundaries in regions of tumor infiltration. We introduce UAMSA-UNet, an Uncertainty-Aware Multi-Scale Attention-based Bayesian U-Net that in- stead leverages Monte Carlo Dropout to learn a data-driven smoothing prior over its predictions, while fusing multi-scale features and attention maps to capture both fine details and global context. Our smoothing-regularized loss augments binary cross-entropy with a variance penalty across stochas- tic forward passes, discouraging spurious fluctuations and yielding spatially coherent masks. On BraTS2023, UAMSA- UNet improves Dice Similarity Coefficient by up to 3.3% and mean IoU by up to 2.7% over U-Net; on BraTS2024, it delivers up to 4.5% Dice and 4.0% IoU gains over the best baseline. Remarkably, it also reduces FLOPs by 42.5% rel- ative to U-Net++ while maintaining higher accuracy. These results demonstrate that, by combining multi-scale attention with a learned smoothing prior, UAMSA-UNet achieves both better segmentation quality and computational efficiency, and provides a flexible foundation for future integration with transformer-based modules for further enhanced segmenta- tion results.

*Chao Yang,Haoyuan Zheng,Yue Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Thermo-LIO is a novel multi-sensor system that fuses thermal imaging with high-resolution LiDAR to improve Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of large-scale civil infrastructure. It enables accurate, real-time detection of surface and subsurface defects by synchronizing and calibrating multimodal data, and integrates with LiDAR-Inertial Odometry for full coverage of complex structures.


<details>

Motivation: Traditional two-dimensional thermography struggles with complex geometries, inaccessible areas, and subsurface defects, limiting its effectiveness in SHM. There is a need for a more comprehensive, accurate, and scalable solution for inspecting large-scale infrastructure.

Method: The study develops a multimodal fusion method to synchronize and calibrate thermal and LiDAR data, then integrates this with LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) to enable continuous, large-scale scanning and precise temperature mapping of buildings.

Result: Experimental tests on a bridge and a hall building show that Thermo-LIO detects thermal anomalies and structural defects with higher accuracy than traditional methods, enabling real-time processing and expanded inspection coverage.

Conclusion: Multimodal sensor integration—specifically combining thermal imaging with LiDAR and LIO—significantly enhances diagnostic precision and scalability in SHM, offering a transformative approach for monitoring large-scale civil infrastructure.

Abstract: Traditional two-dimensional thermography, despite being non-invasive and useful for defect detection in the construction field, is limited in effectively assessing complex geometries, inaccessible areas, and subsurface defects. This paper introduces Thermo-LIO, a novel multi-sensor system that can enhance Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) by fusing thermal imaging with high-resolution LiDAR. To achieve this, the study first develops a multimodal fusion method combining thermal imaging and LiDAR, enabling precise calibration and synchronization of multimodal data streams to create accurate representations of temperature distributions in buildings. Second, it integrates this fusion approach with LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), enabling full coverage of large-scale structures and allowing for detailed monitoring of temperature variations and defect detection across inspection cycles. Experimental validations, including case studies on a bridge and a hall building, demonstrate that Thermo-LIO can detect detailed thermal anomalies and structural defects more accurately than traditional methods. The system enhances diagnostic precision, enables real-time processing, and expands inspection coverage, highlighting the crucial role of multimodal sensor integration in advancing SHM methodologies for large-scale civil infrastructure.

### [9] [SAM-pose2seg: Pose-Guided Human Instance Segmentation in Crowds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08982)
*Constantin Kolomiiets,Miroslav Purkrabek,Jiri Matas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于姿态引导的SAM改进方法，通过引入可见性高的关键点进行微调，提升了模型在遮挡情况下的分割鲁棒性和准确性。仅需三个可见关键点即可实现高精度分割，甚至可仅用一个关键点完成有效预测，同时保持原模型的强大泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的Segment Anything (SAM)模型在人体部分或完全遮挡时表现不佳，因为关键点可能不可见。因此需要一种方法来增强模型对遮挡情况的适应能力，同时保留其强大的通用性。

Method: 对SAM 2.1进行最小修改，引入姿态关键点信息；采用名为PoseMaskRefine的微调策略，将高可见性的关键点融入迭代修正过程；推理阶段仅选择三个最高可见性的关键点作为提示，简化输入并提高稳定性。

Result: 在多个数据集上均实现了更高的分割准确率和鲁棒性，即使在严重遮挡条件下也能生成精确掩码，且对缺失身体部位或衣物误分类等常见错误不敏感。

Conclusion: 通过对SAM进行姿态引导的微调，实现了对遮挡场景下人体分割的有效处理，既增强了模型对遮挡的感知能力，又保持了其原有的强大泛化性能。代码与预训练模型已公开。

Abstract: Segment Anything (SAM) provides an unprecedented foundation for human segmentation, but may struggle under occlusion, where keypoints may be partially or fully invisible. We adapt SAM 2.1 for pose-guided segmentation with minimal encoder modifications, retaining its strong generalization. Using a fine-tuning strategy called PoseMaskRefine, we incorporate pose keypoints with high visibility into the iterative correction process originally employed by SAM, yielding improved robustness and accuracy across multiple datasets. During inference, we simplify prompting by selecting only the three keypoints with the highest visibility. This strategy reduces sensitivity to common errors, such as missing body parts or misclassified clothing, and allows accurate mask prediction from as few as a single keypoint. Our results demonstrate that pose-guided fine-tuning of SAM enables effective, occlusion-aware human segmentation while preserving the generalization capabilities of the original model. The code and pretrained models will be available at https://mirapurkrabek.github.io/BBox-MaskPose.

*Jonas Römer,Timo Dickscheid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在掩码视频变换器中不使用端到端反向传播训练的可能性，通过块级自监督学习（BWSSL）将编码器分块并使用局部掩码重建损失进行优化。实验表明，该方法在不同模型规模和分块粒度下均能收敛，且性能接近端到端基线，尤其在线性探测和检索任务中表现良好。通过深度层面的可解码性、块间相似性和像素级诊断分析，发现块级训练能更早揭示高层结构，后期块趋于饱和并进入更几何保真的状态，同时可能引发令牌级别的变化，这些变化是全局聚合指标所忽视的。研究指出，晚期块饱和与界面形成可能是性能差距的主要原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索掩码视频变换器是否可以在不依赖端到端反向传播的情况下进行有效训练，特别是针对块级自监督学习（BWSSL）在时空上下文和长时序结构处理上的潜力。此外，现有研究缺乏对BWSSL与端到端训练在学习动态和深度表征发展方面的系统比较。

Method: 将视频变换器编码器按块划分，每个块独立优化，采用局部掩码重建损失进行训练；通过线性探测、检索任务评估性能，并分析深度层面的可解码性、块间相似性和像素级诊断以比较中间表示。

Result: 块级训练在多种模型规模和分块粒度下均实现收敛，其生成的表示在多项评估指标上接近端到端基线；分析显示早期更高层次结构被更快揭示，后期块趋于饱和且具有更强的几何保持性；同时存在令牌级别变化，可能影响整体性能但被传统聚合指标忽略。

Conclusion: 块级自监督学习可在无需端到端反向传播的前提下有效训练掩码视频变换器，其优势在于加速高层结构学习，但也面临后期块饱和和界面形成的挑战，这些因素限制了与端到端方法的完全对齐。

Abstract: End-to-end backpropagation couples all layers through a global error signal, enabling coordinated learning but requiring long-range credit assignment. Motivated by recent progress in blockwise self-supervised learning (BWSSL), we ask whether masked video transformers can be trained without end-to-end backpropagation. Applying BWSSL to masked video modeling remains relatively underexplored and must handle spatiotemporal context and long-range temporal structure. More broadly, analyses that compare BWSSL and end-to-end training in terms of learning dynamics and depth-wise representation development remain sparse. We apply blockwise learning to a masked autoencoding video vision transformer by partitioning the encoder into blocks, each of which is optimized with a local masked reconstruction loss. Across model sizes and partition granularities, training converges and yields representations close to matched end-to-end baselines under linear-probe and retrieval proxies. In order to compare intermediate representations, we analyze depth-wise decodability, inter-block similarity, and patch-level diagnostics. Blockwise training exposes higher-level structure earlier, while later blocks saturate and operate in a more geometry-preserving regime. It can also induce token-level shifts consistent with stronger early mixing that pooled metrics can miss. These findings point to late-block saturation and interface formation as contributors to the remaining gap.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的轻量级跟踪方法在训练中仅使用单个模板和搜索图像，导致未能充分挖掘视频中的时空信息，限制了性能提升，拉大了与高性能追踪器的差距。

Method: 采用密集视频采样策略，引入时序传播的时空标记引导特征提取；设计多帧信息融合模块（MFIFM）与时空标记维护器（STM），通过质量感知更新机制保证信息可靠性；引入多尺度预测头以应对目标尺度变化。

Result: 在六个基准测试中均取得当前最优结果；在GOT-10k上性能接近某些非实时高性能追踪器，同时保持192 FPS（GPU）和41 FPS（CPU）的实时运行速度。

Conclusion: STDTrack成功将可靠的时空依赖关系融入轻量级跟踪框架，显著提升了性能，实现了高效与高精度的统一，为轻量级实时目标跟踪提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based lightweight object tracking have established new standards across benchmarks, leveraging the global receptive field and powerful feature extraction capabilities of attention mechanisms. Despite these achievements, existing methods universally employ sparse sampling during training--utilizing only one template and one search image per sequence--which fails to comprehensively explore spatiotemporal information in videos. This limitation constrains performance and cause the gap between lightweight and high-performance trackers. To bridge this divide while maintaining real-time efficiency, we propose STDTrack, a framework that pioneers the integration of reliable spatiotemporal dependencies into lightweight trackers. Our approach implements dense video sampling to maximize spatiotemporal information utilization. We introduce a temporally propagating spatiotemporal token to guide per-frame feature extraction. To ensure comprehensive target state representation, we disign the Multi-frame Information Fusion Module (MFIFM), which augments current dependencies using historical context. The MFIFM operates on features stored in our constructed Spatiotemporal Token Maintainer (STM), where a quality-based update mechanism ensures information reliability. Considering the scale variation among tracking targets, we develop a multi-scale prediction head to dynamically adapt to objects of different sizes. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results across six benchmarks. Notably, on GOT-10k, STDTrack rivals certain high-performance non-real-time trackers (e.g., MixFormer) while operating at 192 FPS(GPU) and 41 FPS(CPU).

Result: 在三个光学遥感图像数据集上，WEFT优于21种SOTA方法，且在伪装、自然和医学场景下均取得最优表现，验证了其有效性与泛化能力。

Conclusion: WEFT通过动态小波专家引导机制，实现了大尺度基础模型在遥感图像分割任务中的高效适配，显著降低了微调开销，同时提升了性能，为大规模模型在遥感领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurately localizing and segmenting relevant objects from optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) is critical for advancing remote sensing applications. Existing methods are typically built upon moderate-scale pre-trained models and employ diverse optimization strategies to achieve promising performance under full-parameter fine-tuning. In fact, deeper and larger-scale foundation models can provide stronger support for performance improvement. However, due to their massive number of parameters, directly adopting full-parameter fine-tuning leads to pronounced training difficulties, such as excessive GPU memory consumption and high computational costs, which result in extremely limited exploration of large-scale models in existing works. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic wavelet expert-guided fine-tuning paradigm with fewer trainable parameters, dubbed WEFT, which efficiently adapts large-scale foundation models to ORSIs segmentation tasks by leveraging the guidance of wavelet experts. Specifically, we introduce a task-specific wavelet expert extractor to model wavelet experts from different perspectives and dynamically regulate their outputs, thereby generating trainable features enriched with task-specific information for subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we construct an expert-guided conditional adapter that first enhances the fine-grained perception of frozen features for specific tasks by injecting trainable features, and then iteratively updates the information of both types of feature, allowing for efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that our WEFT not only outperforms 21 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three ORSIs datasets, but also achieves optimal results in camouflage, natural, and medical scenarios.

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation of time-series remote sensing images remains a critical challenge, particularly in regions where labeled data is scarce or costly to obtain. While state-of-the-art models perform well under full supervision, their performance degrades significantly under limited labeling, limiting their real-world applicability. In this work, we propose SAM-Aug, a new annotation-efficient framework that leverages the geometry-aware segmentation capability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to improve few-shot land cover mapping. Our approach constructs cloud-free composite images from temporal sequences and applies SAM in a fully unsupervised manner to generate geometry-aware mask priors. These priors are then integrated into training through a proposed loss function called RegionSmoothLoss, which enforces prediction consistency within each SAM-derived region across temporal frames, effectively regularizing the model to respect semantically coherent structures. Extensive experiments on the PASTIS-R benchmark under a 5 percent labeled setting demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SAM-Aug. Averaged over three random seeds (42, 2025, 4090), our method achieves a mean test mIoU of 36.21 percent, outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline by +2.33 percentage points, a relative improvement of 6.89 percent. Notably, on the most favorable split (seed=42), SAM-Aug reaches a test mIoU of 40.28 percent, representing an 11.2 percent relative gain with no additional labeled data. The consistent improvement across all seeds confirms the generalization power of leveraging foundation model priors under annotation scarcity. Our results highlight that vision models like SAM can serve as useful regularizers in few-shot remote sensing learning, offering a scalable and plug-and-play solution for land cover monitoring without requiring manual annotations or model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation aims to enable agents to navigate to a target location based on language instructions. Traditional VLN often follows a close-set assumption, i.e., training and test data share the same style of the input images and instructions. However, the real world is open and filled with various unseen environments, posing enormous difficulties for close-set methods. To this end, we focus on the General Scene Adaptation (GSA-VLN) task, aiming to learn generalized navigation ability by introducing diverse environments and inconsistent intructions.Towards this task, when facing unseen environments and instructions, the challenge mainly lies in how to enable the agent to dynamically produce generalized strategies during the navigation process. Recent research indicates that by means of fast and slow cognition systems, human beings could generate stable policies, which strengthen their adaptation for open world. Inspired by this idea, we propose the slow4fast-VLN, establishing a dynamic interactive fast-slow reasoning framework. The fast-reasoning module, an end-to-end strategy network, outputs actions via real-time input. It accumulates execution records in a history repository to build memory. The slow-reasoning module analyze the memories generated by the fast-reasoning module. Through deep reflection, it extracts experiences that enhance the generalization ability of decision-making. These experiences are structurally stored and used to continuously optimize the fast-reasoning module. Unlike traditional methods that treat fast-slow reasoning as independent mechanisms, our framework enables fast-slow interaction. By leveraging the experiences from slow reasoning. This interaction allows the system to continuously adapt and efficiently execute navigation tasks when facing unseen scenarios.

Motivation: 真实世界车牌识别面临运动模糊、低分辨率、复杂光照等严重退化问题。传统‘恢复-识别’两阶段范式存在像素级优化目标与语义识别目标不匹配的问题，导致伪影干扰和误差累积。同时，现有视觉-语言模型缺乏对车牌字符序列结构（如固定长度、特定顺序）的显式建模，限制了其在该任务上的表现。

Abstract: Real-world License Plate Recognition (LPR) faces significant challenges from severe degradations such as motion blur, low resolution, and complex illumination. The prevailing "restoration-then-recognition" two-stage paradigm suffers from a fundamental flaw: the pixel-level optimization objectives of image restoration models are misaligned with the semantic goals of character recognition, leading to artifact interference and error accumulation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated powerful general capabilities, they lack explicit structural modeling for license plate character sequences (e.g., fixed length, specific order). To address this, we propose an end-to-end structure-aware multimodal reasoning framework based on Qwen3-VL. The core innovation lies in the Character-Aware Multimodal Reasoning Module (CMRM), which introduces a set of learnable Character Slot Queries. Through a cross-attention mechanism, these queries actively retrieve fine-grained evidence corresponding to character positions from visual features. Subsequently, we inject these character-aware representations back into the visual tokens via residual modulation, enabling the language model to perform autoregressive generation based on explicit structural priors. Furthermore, combined with the LoRA parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, the model achieves domain adaptation while retaining the generalization capabilities of the large model. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world severely degraded datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing restoration-recognition combinations and general VLMs, validating the superiority of incorporating structured reasoning into large models for low-quality text recognition tasks.

Motivation: 通用大视觉语言模型在皮肤病学任务中受限于‘泛化注意力’，难以从背景噪声中分离出细微病灶，而当前主流依赖参数规模扩展的方法未能有效解决此问题。本文旨在探索非参数扩张路径，提升医疗诊断精度与可靠性。

Conclusion: 优化几何容量与视觉信息传输效率可显著提升皮肤病诊断能力，优于单纯依赖参数规模扩展的路径，为医疗视觉语言模型的设计提供了新范式。

Abstract: General-purpose Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), despite their massive scale, often falter in dermatology due to "diffuse attention" - the inability to disentangle subtle pathological lesions from background noise. In this paper, we challenge the assumption that parameter scaling is the only path to medical precision. We introduce SkinFlow, a framework that treats diagnosis as an optimization of visual information transmission efficiency. Our approach utilizes a Virtual-Width Dynamic Vision Encoder (DVE) to "unfold" complex pathological manifolds without physical parameter expansion, coupled with a two-stage Reinforcement Learning strategy. This strategy sequentially aligns explicit medical descriptions (Stage I) and reconstructs implicit diagnostic textures (Stage II) within a constrained semantic space. Furthermore, we propose a clinically grounded evaluation protocol that prioritizes diagnostic safety and hierarchical relevance over rigid label matching. Empirical results are compelling: our 7B model establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Fitzpatrick17k benchmark, achieving a +12.06% gain in Top-1 accuracy and a +28.57% boost in Top-6 accuracy over the massive general-purpose models (e.g., Qwen3VL-235B and GPT-5.2). These findings demonstrate that optimizing geometric capacity and information flow yields superior diagnostic reasoning compared to raw parameter scaling.

Abstract: Robustness to natural corruptions remains a critical challenge for reliable deep learning, particularly in safety-sensitive domains. We study a family of model-based training approaches that leverage a learned nuisance variation model to generate realistic corruptions, as well as new hybrid strategies that combine random coverage with adversarial refinement in nuisance space. Using the Challenging Unreal and Real Environments for Traffic Sign Recognition dataset (CURE-TSR), with Snow and Rain corruptions, we evaluate accuracy, calibration, and training complexity across corruption severities. Our results show that model-based methods consistently outperform baselines Vanilla, Adversarial Training, and AugMix baselines, with model-based adversarial training providing the strongest robustness under across all corruptions but at the expense of higher computation and model-based data augmentation achieving comparable robustness with $T$ less computational complexity without incurring a statistically significant drop in performance. These findings highlight the importance of learned nuisance models for capturing natural variability, and suggest a promising path toward more resilient and calibrated models under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) text-to-image systems are increasingly used to generate architectural imagery, yet their capacity to reproduce accurate images in a historically rule-bound field remains poorly characterized. We evaluated five widely used GenAI image platforms (Adobe Firefly, DALL-E 3, Google Imagen 3, Microsoft Image Generator, and Midjourney) using 30 architectural prompts spanning styles, typologies, and codified elements. Each prompt-generator pair produced four images (n = 600 images total). Two architectural historians independently scored each image for accuracy against predefined criteria, resolving disagreements by consensus. Set-level performance was summarized as zero to four accurate images per four-image set. Image output from Common prompts was 2.7-fold more accurate than from Rare prompts (p < 0.05). Across platforms, overall accuracy was limited (highest accuracy score 52 percent; lowest 32 percent; mean 42 percent). All-correct (4 out of 4) outcomes were similar across platforms. By contrast, all-incorrect (0 out of 4) outcomes varied substantially, with Imagen 3 exhibiting the fewest failures and Microsoft Image Generator exhibiting the highest number of failures. Qualitative review of the image dataset identified recurring patterns including over-embellishment, confusion between medieval styles and their later revivals, and misrepresentation of descriptive prompts (for example, egg-and-dart, banded column, pendentive). These findings support the need for visible labeling of GenAI synthetic content, provenance standards for future training datasets, and cautious educational use of GenAI architectural imagery.

Abstract: In this work, we propose N EIoU YOLOv9, a lightweight detection framework based on a signal aware bounding box regression loss derived from non monotonic gradient focusing and geometric decoupling principles, referred to as N EIoU (Non monotonic Efficient Intersection over Union). The proposed loss reshapes localization gradients by combining non monotonic focusing with decoupled width and height optimization, thereby enhancing weak regression signals for hard samples with low overlap while reducing gradient interference. This design is particularly effective for small and low contrast targets commonly observed in agricultural disease imagery. The proposed N EIoU loss is integrated into a lightweight YOLOv9t architecture and evaluated on a self collected field dataset comprising 5908 rice leaf images across four disease categories and healthy leaves. Experimental results demonstrate consistent performance gains over the standard CIoU loss, achieving a mean Average Precision of 90.3 percent, corresponding to a 4.3 percent improvement over the baseline, with improved localization accuracy under stricter evaluation criteria. For practical validation, the optimized model is deployed on an Android device using TensorFlow Lite with Float16 quantization, achieving an average inference time of 156 milliseconds per frame while maintaining accuracy. These results confirm that the proposed approach effectively balances accuracy, optimization stability, and computational efficiency for edge based agricultural monitoring systems.

Abstract: Deploying medical image segmentation models in routine clinical workflows is often constrained by on-premises infrastructure, where computational resources are fixed and cloud-based inference may be restricted by governance and security policies. While high-capacity models achieve strong segmentation accuracy, their computational demands hinder practical deployment and long-term maintainability in hospital environments. We present a deployment-oriented framework that leverages knowledge distillation to translate a high-performing segmentation model into a scalable family of compact student models, without modifying the inference pipeline. The proposed approach preserves architectural compatibility with existing clinical systems while enabling systematic capacity reduction. The framework is evaluated on a multi-site brain MRI dataset comprising 1,104 3D volumes, with independent testing on 101 curated cases, and is further examined on abdominal CT to assess cross-modality generalizability. Under aggressive parameter reduction (94%), the distilled student model preserves nearly all of the teacher's segmentation accuracy (98.7%), while achieving substantial efficiency gains, including up to a 67% reduction in CPU inference latency without additional deployment overhead. These results demonstrate that knowledge distillation provides a practical and reliable pathway for converting research-grade segmentation models into maintainable, deployment-ready components for on-premises clinical workflows in real-world health systems.

Abstract: Purpose: Myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos is a challenging task due to low contrast, noise, and anatomical variability. Traditional deep learning models either process frames independently, ignoring temporal information, or rely on memory-based feature propagation, which accumulates error over time. Methods: We propose Point-Seg, a transformer-based segmentation framework that integrates point tracking as a temporal cue to ensure stable and consistent segmentation of myocardium across frames. Our method leverages a point-tracking module trained on a synthetic echocardiography dataset to track key anatomical landmarks across video sequences. These tracked trajectories provide an explicit motion-aware signal that guides segmentation, reducing drift and eliminating the need for memory-based feature accumulation. Additionally, we incorporate a temporal smoothing loss to further enhance temporal consistency across frames. Results: We evaluate our approach on both public and private echocardiography datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that Point-Seg has statistically similar accuracy in terms of Dice to state-of-the-art segmentation models in high quality echo data, while it achieves better segmentation accuracy in lower quality echo with improved temporal stability. Furthermore, Point-Seg has the key advantage of pixel-level myocardium motion information as opposed to other segmentation methods. Such information is essential in the computation of other downstream tasks such as myocardial strain measurement and regional wall motion abnormality detection. Conclusion: Point-Seg demonstrates that point tracking can serve as an effective temporal cue for consistent video segmentation, offering a reliable and generalizable approach for myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos.

Abstract: White-Light Imaging (WLI) is the standard for endoscopic cancer screening, but Narrow-Band Imaging (NBI) offers superior diagnostic details. A key challenge is transferring knowledge from NBI to enhance WLI-only models, yet existing methods are critically hampered by their reliance on paired NBI-WLI images of the same lesion, a costly and often impractical requirement that leaves vast amounts of clinical data untapped. In this paper, we break this paradigm by introducing PaGKD, a novel Pairing-free Group-level Knowledge Distillation framework that that enables effective cross-modal learning using unpaired WLI and NBI data. Instead of forcing alignment between individual, often semantically mismatched image instances, PaGKD operates at the group level to distill more complete and compatible knowledge across modalities. Central to PaGKD are two complementary modules: (1) Group-level Prototype Distillation (GKD-Pro) distills compact group representations by extracting modality-invariant semantic prototypes via shared lesion-aware queries; (2) Group-level Dense Distillation (GKD-Den) performs dense cross-modal alignment by guiding group-aware attention with activation-derived relation maps. Together, these modules enforce global semantic consistency and local structural coherence without requiring image-level correspondence. Extensive experiments on four clinical datasets demonstrate that PaGKD consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving relative AUC improvements of 3.3%, 1.1%, 2.8%, and 3.2%, respectively, establishing a new direction for cross-modal learning from unpaired data.

TL;DR: 提出Affostruction框架，通过生成式多视角重建、基于流的显性接地和显性驱动的主动视角选择，实现从部分观测中推断完整几何形状并准确预测动作亲和性区域，在3D重建和亲和性接地任务上分别取得67.7%和40.4%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅在可见表面预测亲和性区域，无法处理未观测区域，限制了对物体完整功能理解的能力。为解决这一问题，需要一种能够重建完整几何结构并在此基础上进行亲和性定位的方法。

Method: 采用稀疏体素融合实现生成式多视角重建以推断不可见几何；使用基于流的模型捕捉亲和性分布中的固有模糊性；设计亲和性驱动的主动视角选择策略，智能采样有效视点以优化重建与预测。

Result: 在亲和性接地任务上达到19.1 aIoU（相比之前提升40.4%），在3D重建任务上达到32.67 IoU（提升67.7%），实现了对完整物体形状的高精度亲和性预测。

Conclusion: Affostruction通过联合优化几何重建与亲和性接地，显著提升了在不完整观测下的功能理解能力，为机器人交互中的物体操作提供了更全面的感知基础。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of affordance grounding from RGBD images of an object, which aims to localize surface regions corresponding to a text query that describes an action on the object. While existing methods predict affordance regions only on visible surfaces, we propose Affostruction, a generative framework that reconstructs complete geometry from partial observations and grounds affordances on the full shape including unobserved regions. We make three core contributions: generative multi-view reconstruction via sparse voxel fusion that extrapolates unseen geometry while maintaining constant token complexity, flow-based affordance grounding that captures inherent ambiguity in affordance distributions, and affordance-driven active view selection that leverages predicted affordances for intelligent viewpoint sampling. Affostruction achieves 19.1 aIoU on affordance grounding (40.4\% improvement) and 32.67 IoU for 3D reconstruction (67.7\% improvement), enabling accurate affordance prediction on complete shapes.

Conclusion: COOL-SD通过理论指导的退火松弛设计，在自回归图像生成中实现了高效且高质量的推理，为未来高效生成模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in autoregressive image generation, inference remains slow due to the sequential nature of AR models and the ambiguity of image tokens, even when using speculative decoding. Recent works attempt to address this with relaxed speculative decoding but lack theoretical grounding. In this paper, we establish the theoretical basis of relaxed SD and propose COOL-SD, an annealed relaxation of speculative decoding built on two key insights. The first analyzes the total variation (TV) distance between the target model and relaxed speculative decoding and yields an optimal resampling distribution that minimizes an upper bound of the distance. The second uses perturbation analysis to reveal an annealing behaviour in relaxed speculative decoding, motivating our annealed design. Together, these insights enable COOL-SD to generate images faster with comparable quality, or achieve better quality at similar latency. Experiments validate the effectiveness of COOL-SD, showing consistent improvements over prior methods in speed-quality trade-offs.

Motivation: 从神经脉冲活动中重建自然视觉场景是神经科学与计算机视觉的关键挑战，现有方法在图像质量和分辨率方面存在局限，亟需更高效、高精度的解码框架。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段使用非常深的变分自编码器（VDVAE）将神经脉冲信号映射到低分辨率潜在表示；第二阶段通过回归模型将脉冲信号转换为 CLIP-Vision 与 CLIP-Text 特征，驱动通用扩散模型进行图像精修。

Abstract: Reconstructing natural visual scenes from neural activity is a key challenge in neuroscience and computer vision. We present SpikeVAEDiff, a novel two-stage framework that combines a Very Deep Variational Autoencoder (VDVAE) and the Versatile Diffusion model to generate high-resolution and semantically meaningful image reconstructions from neural spike data. In the first stage, VDVAE produces low-resolution preliminary reconstructions by mapping neural spike signals to latent representations. In the second stage, regression models map neural spike signals to CLIP-Vision and CLIP-Text features, enabling Versatile Diffusion to refine the images via image-to-image generation.
  We evaluate our approach on the Allen Visual Coding-Neuropixels dataset and analyze different brain regions. Our results show that the VISI region exhibits the most prominent activation and plays a key role in reconstruction quality. We present both successful and unsuccessful reconstruction examples, reflecting the challenges of decoding neural activity. Compared with fMRI-based approaches, spike data provides superior temporal and spatial resolution. We further validate the effectiveness of the VDVAE model and conduct ablation studies demonstrating that data from specific brain regions significantly enhances reconstruction performance.

Abstract: Infrared object detection focuses on identifying and locating objects in complex environments (\eg, dark, snow, and rain) where visible imaging cameras are disabled by poor illumination. However, due to low contrast and weak edge information in infrared images, it is challenging to extract discriminative object features for robust detection. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel vision-language representation learning paradigm for infrared object detection. An additional textual supervision with rich semantic information is explored to guide the disentanglement of object and non-object features. Specifically, we propose a Semantic Feature Alignment (SFA) module to align the object features with the corresponding text features. Furthermore, we develop an Object Feature Disentanglement (OFD) module that disentangles text-aligned object features and non-object features by minimizing their correlation. Finally, the disentangled object features are entered into the detection head. In this manner, the detection performance can be remarkably enhanced via more discriminative and less noisy features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on two benchmarks: M\textsuperscript{3}FD (83.7\% mAP), FLIR (86.1\% mAP). Our code will be publicly available once the paper is accepted.

Conclusion: DeTracker通过运动解耦与时空特征融合，有效应对未稳定卫星视频中的多目标跟踪挑战，为复杂动态环境下的遥感视频分析提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Satellite videos provide continuous observations of surface dynamics but pose significant challenges for multi-object tracking (MOT), especially under unstabilized conditions where platform jitter and the weak appearance of tiny objects jointly degrade tracking performance. To address this problem, we propose DeTracker, a joint detection-and-tracking framework tailored for unstabilized satellite videos. DeTracker introduces a Global--Local Motion Decoupling (GLMD) module that explicitly separates satellite platform motion from true object motion through global alignment and local refinement, leading to improved trajectory stability and motion estimation accuracy. In addition, a Temporal Dependency Feature Pyramid (TDFP) module is developed to perform cross-frame temporal feature fusion, enhancing the continuity and discriminability of tiny-object representations. We further construct a new benchmark dataset, SDM-Car-SU, which simulates multi-directional and multi-speed platform motions to enable systematic evaluation of tracking robustness under varying motion perturbations. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real unstabilized satellite videos demonstrate that DeTracker significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 61.1% MOTA on SDM-Car-SU and 47.3% MOTA on real satellite video data.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a powerful representation for high-quality, real-time 3D scene rendering. While recent works extend Gaussians with learnable textures to enrich visual appearance, existing approaches allocate a fixed square texture per primitive, leading to inefficient memory usage and limited adaptability to scene variability. In this paper, we introduce adaptive anisotropic textured Gaussians (A$^2$TG), a novel representation that generalizes textured Gaussians by equipping each primitive with an anisotropic texture. Our method employs a gradient-guided adaptive rule to jointly determine texture resolution and aspect ratio, enabling non-uniform, detail-aware allocation that aligns with the anisotropic nature of Gaussian splats. This design significantly improves texture efficiency, reducing memory consumption while enhancing image quality. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that A TG consistently outperforms fixed-texture Gaussian Splatting methods, achieving comparable rendering fidelity with substantially lower memory requirements.

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based video generation models can synthesize visually plausible videos, yet they often struggle to satisfy physical constraints. A key reason is that most existing approaches remain single-stage: they entangle high-level physical understanding with low-level visual synthesis, making it hard to generate content that require explicit physical reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose a training-free three-stage pipeline,\textit{PhyRPR}:\textit{Phy\uline{R}eason}--\textit{Phy\uline{P}lan}--\textit{Phy\uline{R}efine}, which decouples physical understanding from visual synthesis. Specifically, \textit{PhyReason} uses a large multimodal model for physical state reasoning and an image generator for keyframe synthesis; \textit{PhyPlan} deterministically synthesizes a controllable coarse motion scaffold; and \textit{PhyRefine} injects this scaffold into diffusion sampling via a latent fusion strategy to refine appearance while preserving the planned dynamics. This staged design enables explicit physical control during generation. Extensive experiments under physics constraints show that our method consistently improves physical plausibility and motion controllability.

Abstract: Delineating wildfire affected areas using satellite imagery remains challenging due to irregular and spatially heterogeneous spectral changes across the electromagnetic spectrum. While recent deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy when high-resolution multispectral data are available, their applicability in operational settings, where a quick delineation of the burn scar shortly after a wildfire incident is required, is limited by the trade-off between spatial resolution and temporal revisit frequency of current satellite systems. To address this limitation, we propose a novel deep learning model, namely BAM-MRCD, which employs multi-resolution, multi-source satellite imagery (MODIS and Sentinel-2) for the timely production of detailed burnt area maps with high spatial and temporal resolution. Our model manages to detect even small scale wildfires with high accuracy, surpassing similar change detection models as well as solid baselines.

Abstract: Whole-brain parcellation from MRI is a critical yet challenging task due to the complexity of subdividing the brain into numerous small, irregular shaped regions. Traditionally, template-registration methods were used, but recent advances have shifted to deep learning for faster workflows. While large models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offer transferable feature representations, they are not tailored for the high precision required in brain parcellation. To address this, we propose BrainSegNet, a novel framework that adapts SAM for accurate whole-brain parcellation into 95 regions. We enhance SAM by integrating U-Net skip connections and specialized modules into its encoder and decoder, enabling fine-grained anatomical precision. Key components include a hybrid encoder combining U-Net skip connections with SAM's transformer blocks, a multi-scale attention decoder with pyramid pooling for varying-sized structures, and a boundary refinement module to sharpen edges. Experimental results on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset demonstrate that BrainSegNet outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in complex, multi-label parcellation.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a prominent 3D representation for high-fidelity and real-time rendering. Prior work has coupled physics simulation with Gaussians, but predominantly targets soft, deformable materials, leaving brittle fracture largely unresolved. This stems from two key obstacles: the lack of volumetric interiors with coherent textures in GS representation, and the absence of fracture-aware simulation methods for Gaussians. To address these challenges, we introduce GaussianFluent, a unified framework for realistic simulation and rendering of dynamic object states. First, it synthesizes photorealistic interiors by densifying internal Gaussians guided by generative models. Second, it integrates an optimized Continuum Damage Material Point Method (CD-MPM) to enable brittle fracture simulation at remarkably high speed. Our approach handles complex scenarios including mixed-material objects and multi-stage fracture propagation, achieving results infeasible with previous methods. Experiments clearly demonstrate GaussianFluent's capability for photo-realistic, real-time rendering with structurally consistent interiors, highlighting its potential for downstream application, such as VR and Robotics.

Abstract: In the information and communications technology (ICT) industry, training a domain-specific large language model (LLM) or constructing a retrieval-augmented generation system requires a substantial amount of high-value domain knowledge. However, the knowledge is not only hidden in the textual modality but also in the image modality. Traditional methods can parse text from domain documents but dont have image captioning ability. Multi-modal LLM (MLLM) can understand images, but they do not have sufficient domain knowledge. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a multi-stage progressive training strategy to train a Domain-specific Image Captioning Model (DICModel) in ICT, and constructs a standard evaluation system to validate the performance of DICModel. Specifically, this work first synthesizes about 7K image-text pairs by combining the Mermaid tool and LLMs, which are used for the first-stage supervised-fine-tuning (SFT) of DICModel. Then, ICT-domain experts manually annotate about 2K image-text pairs for the second-stage SFT of DICModel. Finally, experts and LLMs jointly synthesize about 1.5K visual question answering data for the instruction-based SFT. Experimental results indicate that our DICModel with only 7B parameters performs better than other state-of-the-art models with 32B parameters. Compared to the SOTA models with 7B and 32B parameters, our DICModel increases the BLEU metric by approximately 56.8% and 20.8%, respectively. On the objective questions constructed by ICT domain experts, our DICModel outperforms Qwen2.5-VL 32B by 1% in terms of accuracy rate. In summary, this work can efficiently and accurately extract the logical text from images, which is expected to promote the development of multimodal models in the ICT domain.

Abstract: With the rise of large-scale foundation models, efficiently adapting them to downstream tasks remains a central challenge. Linear probing, which freezes the backbone and trains a lightweight head, is computationally efficient but often restricted to last-layer representations. We show that task-relevant information is distributed across the network hierarchy rather than solely encoded in any of the last layers. To leverage this distribution of information, we apply an attentive probing mechanism that dynamically fuses representations from all layers of a Vision Transformer. This mechanism learns to identify the most relevant layers for a target task and combines low-level structural cues with high-level semantic abstractions. Across 20 diverse datasets and multiple pretrained foundation models, our method achieves consistent, substantial gains over standard linear probes. Attention heatmaps further reveal that tasks different from the pre-training domain benefit most from intermediate representations. Overall, our findings underscore the value of intermediate layer information and demonstrate a principled, task aware approach for unlocking their potential in probing-based adaptation.

Abstract: With advances in artificial intelligence, image processing has gained significant interest. Image super-resolution is a vital technology closely related to real-world applications, as it enhances the quality of existing images. Since enhancing fine details is crucial for the super-resolution task, pixels that contribute to high-frequency information should be emphasized. This paper proposes two methods to enhance high-frequency details in super-resolution images: a Laplacian pyramid-based detail loss and a repeated upscaling and downscaling process. Total loss with our detail loss guides a model by separately generating and controlling super-resolution and detail images. This approach allows the model to focus more effectively on high-frequency components, resulting in improved super-resolution images. Additionally, repeated upscaling and downscaling amplify the effectiveness of the detail loss by extracting diverse information from multiple low-resolution features. We conduct two types of experiments. First, we design a CNN-based model incorporating our methods. This model achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing all currently available CNN-based and even some attention-based models. Second, we apply our methods to existing attention-based models on a small scale. In all our experiments, attention-based models adding our detail loss show improvements compared to the originals. These results demonstrate our approaches effectively enhance super-resolution images across different model structures.

TL;DR: 该研究针对新辅助化疗后骨肉瘤中存活与非存活肿瘤区域的病理评估难题，提出结合影像组学特征和分层分类损失的深度学习方法，显著提升了模型性能与可解释性，在TCIA OS肿瘤评估数据集上达到新基准水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动评估肿瘤存活状态耗时且主观性强，存在观察者间差异；尽管数字病理学已支持自动化坏死量化，但现有模型在患者层面测试时性能下降明显，亟需更鲁棒、可解释的方法提升预测准确性。

Result: 实验表明，两种改进策略均有效提升分类准确率，尤其在患者级测试中表现显著优于传统方法；组合使用时达到当前该任务在公开数据集上的最优性能。

Conclusion: 通过融合影像组学特征与分层损失机制，本研究构建了一种更稳健、可解释的自动化评估框架，为骨肉瘤治疗响应评估提供了新的技术范式。

Abstract: Osteosarcoma (OS) is an aggressive primary bone malignancy. Accurate histopathological assessment of viable versus non-viable tumor regions after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is critical for prognosis and treatment planning, yet manual evaluation remains labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to inter-observer variability. Recent advances in digital pathology have enabled automated necrosis quantification. Evaluating on test data, independently sampled on patient-level, revealed that the deep learning model performance dropped significantly from the tile-level generalization ability reported in previous studies. First, this work proposes the use of radiomic features as additional input in model training. We show that, despite that they are derived from the images, such a multimodal input effectively improved the classification performance, in addition to its added benefits in interpretability. Second, this work proposes to optimize two binary classification tasks with hierarchical classes (i.e. tumor-vs-non-tumor and viable-vs-non-viable), as opposed to the alternative ``flat'' three-class classification task (i.e. non-tumor, non-viable tumor, viable tumor), thereby enabling a hierarchical loss. We show that such a hierarchical loss, with trainable weightings between the two tasks, the per-class performance can be improved significantly. Using the TCIA OS Tumor Assessment dataset, we experimentally demonstrate the benefits from each of the proposed new approaches and their combination, setting a what we consider new state-of-the-art performance on this open dataset for this application.

Conclusion: Video-MSR是评估多跳空间推理的关键基准，多跳空间指令数据能显著提升模型性能，推动MLLM在复杂空间推理任务上的发展。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), drawing increasing attention and rapid advancement. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on single-step perception-to-judgment tasks, leaving scenarios requiring complex visual-spatial logical chains significantly underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-MSR, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate Multi-hop Spatial Reasoning (MSR) in dynamic video scenarios. Video-MSR systematically probes MSR capabilities through four distinct tasks: Constrained Localization, Chain-based Reference Retrieval, Route Planning, and Counterfactual Physical Deduction. Our benchmark comprises 3,052 high-quality video instances with 4,993 question-answer pairs, constructed via a scalable, visually-grounded pipeline combining advanced model generation with rigorous human verification. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations, revealing that while models demonstrate proficiency in surface-level perception, they exhibit distinct performance drops in MSR tasks, frequently suffering from spatial disorientation and hallucination during multi-step deductions. To mitigate these shortcomings and empower models with stronger MSR capabilities, we further curate MSR-9K, a specialized instruction-tuning dataset, and fine-tune Qwen-VL, achieving a +7.82% absolute improvement on Video-MSR. Our results underscore the efficacy of multi-hop spatial instruction data and establish Video-MSR as a vital foundation for future research. The code and data will be available at https://github.com/ruiz-nju/Video-MSR.

*Ritabrata Chakraborty,Hrishit Mitra,Shivakumara Palaiahnakote,Umapada Pal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究跨数据集目标检测（CD-OD）中的设置特异性问题，将数据集分为与场景无关的通用数据集和特定环境的专用数据集，发现同一设置类型内迁移较稳定，而跨设置类型迁移性能显著下降且常呈不对称性。从专用到通用的迁移退化最严重，即使经过开放标签对齐仍存在明显性能下降，表明领域偏移是主要因素。通过对比封闭标签与基于CLIP相似性的开放标签迁移，发现后者带来一致但有限的提升，多数修正案例为语义相近的误判，支持图像证据。研究提供了关于设置特异性的系统性分析及评估分布偏移下检测器的实用指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有目标检测器在同分布下表现良好，但在跨数据集测试时性能急剧下降。传统研究未区分数据集的设置特性，导致对性能退化的理解不充分。本文旨在揭示跨数据集检测中因设置特异性带来的结构化行为，以更准确地理解分布偏移的影响，并提供合理的评估框架。

Method: 将数据集划分为设置-无关（如COCO、Pascal VOC）与设置-特定（如Cityscapes、Kitti）两类；在所有训练-测试组合上评估标准检测器家族；采用封闭标签与开放标签（基于CLIP相似性映射预测类别至最近目标类）两种协议进行对比；通过定量分析迁移性能的稳定性、不对称性和标签匹配误差，解耦领域偏移与标签不匹配的影响。

Result: 跨设置类型的迁移性能显著下降，尤其从设置特定到设置无关的迁移最为严重，且不对称性强；开放标签对齐可带来一致但有限的性能提升；大量修正案例对应于语义相近的类别，且有图像证据支持；领域偏移是性能崩溃的主要原因。

Conclusion: 设置特异性是影响跨数据集目标检测性能的关键因素。迁移稳定性高度依赖于源与目标数据集的设置类型一致性。领域偏移主导了最困难的迁移场景，而标签不匹配的影响相对较小。建议在评估检测器时考虑设置类型的一致性，并采用开放标签协议以更真实反映模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Object detectors often perform well in-distribution, yet degrade sharply on a different benchmark. We study cross-dataset object detection (CD-OD) through a lens of setting specificity. We group benchmarks into setting-agnostic datasets with diverse everyday scenes and setting-specific datasets tied to a narrow environment, and evaluate a standard detector family across all train--test pairs. This reveals a clear structure in CD-OD: transfer within the same setting type is relatively stable, while transfer across setting types drops substantially and is often asymmetric. The most severe breakdowns occur when transferring from specific sources to agnostic targets, and persist after open-label alignment, indicating that domain shift dominates in the hardest regimes. To disentangle domain shift from label mismatch, we compare closed-label transfer with an open-label protocol that maps predicted classes to the nearest target label using CLIP similarity. Open-label evaluation yields consistent but bounded gains, and many corrected cases correspond to semantic near-misses supported by the image evidence. Overall, we provide a principled characterization of CD-OD under setting specificity and practical guidance for evaluating detectors under distribution shift. Code will be released at \href{[https://github.com/Ritabrata04/cdod-icpr.git}{https://github.com/Ritabrata04/cdod-icpr}.

*Edgar Sucar,Eldar Insafutdinov,Zihang Lai,Andrea Vedaldi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出V-DPM，一种用于视频输入的动态点图（DPM）方法，通过最大化表示能力、促进神经预测并复用预训练模型，实现了对动态场景的3D和4D重建。即使在仅使用少量合成数据微调的情况下，该方法也能在动态场景重建中达到最先进的性能，且能恢复每个点的完整3D运动信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态点图（DPM）方法仅适用于图像对，且在多视图情况下需依赖后处理优化；而视频输入更符合真实动态场景，因此需要更高效、可扩展的动态3D表示方法。

Method: 提出V-DPM框架，将DPM扩展至视频输入，设计了增强表示能力的建模方式，并基于VGGT构建神经预测器，利用少量合成数据进行微调以适应动态场景。

Result: 在动态场景的3D与4D重建任务中达到当前最优性能，能够同时恢复深度和每个点的完整3D运动，优于如P3等近期改进方法。

Conclusion: V-DPM成功将静态点图扩展到视频动态场景，具备更强的表示能力和实用性，为动态3D重建提供了新范式。

Abstract: Powerful 3D representations such as DUSt3R invariant point maps, which encode 3D shape and camera parameters, have significantly advanced feed forward 3D reconstruction. While point maps assume static scenes, Dynamic Point Maps (DPMs) extend this concept to dynamic 3D content by additionally representing scene motion. However, existing DPMs are limited to image pairs and, like DUSt3R, require post processing via optimization when more than two views are involved. We argue that DPMs are more useful when applied to videos and introduce V-DPM to demonstrate this. First, we show how to formulate DPMs for video input in a way that maximizes representational power, facilitates neural prediction, and enables reuse of pretrained models. Second, we implement these ideas on top of VGGT, a recent and powerful 3D reconstructor. Although VGGT was trained on static scenes, we show that a modest amount of synthetic data is sufficient to adapt it into an effective V-DPM predictor. Our approach achieves state of the art performance in 3D and 4D reconstruction for dynamic scenes. In particular, unlike recent dynamic extensions of VGGT such as P3, DPMs recover not only dynamic depth but also the full 3D motion of every point in the scene.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel application of Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (V-JEPAs) for Facial Expression Recognition (FER). Departing from conventional pre-training methods for video understanding that rely on pixel-level reconstructions, V-JEPAs learn by predicting embeddings of masked regions from the embeddings of unmasked regions. This enables the trained encoder to not capture irrelevant information about a given video like the color of a region of pixels in the background. Using a pre-trained V-JEPA video encoder, we train shallow classifiers using the RAVDESS and CREMA-D datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on RAVDESS and outperforming all other vision-based methods on CREMA-D (+1.48 WAR). Furthermore, cross-dataset evaluations reveal strong generalization capabilities, demonstrating the potential of purely embedding-based pre-training approaches to advance FER. We release our code at https://github.com/lennarteingunia/vjepa-for-fer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在目标域可访问但无法实时标注数据的情况下，传统方法难以构建高质量训练集；若训练集缺乏目标域的关键语义模式，模型性能将下降。因此需要优化数据服务器的结构，以更好地支持训练集搜索。

Method: 提出层次化数据服务器架构，并设计双分图模式匹配算法（BMM），对目标域的每个模式在数据服务器中寻找最佳源域模式匹配，实现一对一最优匹配，从而构建具有更小领域差距的训练集。

Result: 相比现有训练集搜索算法，所提方法构建的训练集与目标域之间的领域差距更小，在物体重识别和检测任务中模型准确率更高；且可与伪标签等现有无监督域自适应方法结合，取得进一步性能提升。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了数据服务器结构优化在无监督域自适应中的关键作用，提出的数据驱动方法为无监督域自适应提供了新的数据中心范式，具有良好的扩展性和兼容性。

Abstract: We explore a situation in which the target domain is accessible, but real-time data annotation is not feasible. Instead, we would like to construct an alternative training set from a large-scale data server so that a competitive model can be obtained. For this problem, because the target domain usually exhibits distinct modes (i.e., semantic clusters representing data distribution), if the training set does not contain these target modes, the model performance would be compromised. While prior existing works improve algorithms iteratively, our research explores the often-overlooked potential of optimizing the structure of the data server. Inspired by the hierarchical nature of web search engines, we introduce a hierarchical data server, together with a bipartite mode matching algorithm (BMM) to align source and target modes. For each target mode, we look in the server data tree for the best mode match, which might be large or small in size. Through bipartite matching, we aim for all target modes to be optimally matched with source modes in a one-on-one fashion. Compared with existing training set search algorithms, we show that the matched server modes constitute training sets that have consistently smaller domain gaps with the target domain across object re-identification (re-ID) and detection tasks. Consequently, models trained on our searched training sets have higher accuracy than those trained otherwise. BMM allows data-centric unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) orthogonal to existing model-centric UDA methods. By combining the BMM with existing UDA methods like pseudo-labeling, further improvement is observed.

TL;DR: 本文研究了将低分辨率视觉输入（如8×8像素的灰度图像）作为中文字符建模的替代方式，发现其在字符级语言建模中表现与传统的基于索引的表示方法相当（准确率分别为39.2%和39.1%），且在训练初期展现出显著的‘热启动’优势，表明最小视觉结构可提供强大而高效的语义与音韵信息信号，为中文表意文字建模提供了互补性的新视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大语言模型将中文字符表示为离散索引，忽略了其视觉结构所蕴含的语义与语音信息。对于表意文字而言，视觉形式本身可能包含有助于预测的关键线索，因此探索视觉输入作为字符建模的新途径具有重要意义。

Method: 提出一种基于低分辨率灰度图像（最低8×8像素）的字符表示方法，取代传统的索引式令牌表示；模型的解码器直接接收这些视觉输入，并在相同任务下与基于索引的基准模型进行对比实验。

Result: 低分辨率视觉输入达到39.2%的准确率，与索引基线（39.1%）接近；在仅0.4%训练量时，视觉模型准确率已超12%，而索引模型低于6%，表现出明显热启动优势。

Conclusion: 最小视觉结构能够为中文语言建模提供稳健且高效的信号，验证了视觉形式在表意文字处理中的价值，为字符表示提供了与传统索引方法互补的新范式。

Abstract: Large language models typically represent Chinese characters as discrete index-based tokens, largely ignoring their visual form. For logographic scripts, visual structure carries semantic and phonetic information, which may aid prediction. We investigate whether low-resolution visual inputs can serve as an alternative for character-level modeling. Instead of token IDs, our decoder receives grayscale images of individual characters, with resolutions as low as $8 \times 8$ pixels. Remarkably, these inputs achieve 39.2\% accuracy, comparable to the index-based baseline of 39.1\%. Such low-resource settings also exhibit a pronounced \emph{hot-start} effect: by 0.4\% of total training, accuracy reaches above 12\%, while index-based models lag at below 6\%. Overall, our results demonstrate that minimal visual structure can provide a robust and efficient signal for Chinese language modeling, offering an alternative perspective on character representation that complements traditional index-based approaches.

TL;DR: DF-DiffCom is a KAN-enhanced diffusion model that uses deformation fields to improve longitudinal brain MRI completion, achieving better image quality and flexibility across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High attrition rates in longitudinal brain MRI studies lead to missing data, and existing deep generative models often lack fidelity and flexibility due to reliance on image intensity alone.

Method: DF-DiffCom employs Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to enhance a diffusion model, leveraging deformation fields for more accurate and trustworthy brain image completion.

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a 5.6% improvement in PSNR and 0.12 increase in SSIM on OASIS-3 dataset, and supports diverse MRI modalities and attribute maps.

Conclusion: DF-DiffCom provides a robust, flexible solution for longitudinal brain image completion, enabling reliable downstream analysis across various imaging scenarios.

Abstract: Longitudinal brain MRI is essential for lifespan study, yet high attrition rates often lead to missing data, complicating analysis. Deep generative models have been explored, but most rely solely on image intensity, leading to two key limitations: 1) the fidelity or trustworthiness of the generated brain images are limited, making downstream studies questionable; 2) the usage flexibility is restricted due to fixed guidance rooted in the model structure, restricting full ability to versatile application scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DF-DiffCom, a Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)-enhanced diffusion model that smartly leverages deformation fields for trustworthy longitudinal brain image completion. Trained on OASIS-3, DF-DiffCom outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving PSNR by 5.6% and SSIM by 0.12. More importantly, its modality-agnostic nature allows smooth extension to varied MRI modalities, even to attribute maps such as brain tissue segmentation results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在开放词汇3D场景理解中通常依赖于训练过程或特定文本编码器嵌入，限制了灵活性与泛化能力。为提升对复杂场景的理解能力，亟需一种无需训练、能直接利用强大多模态模型进行语义描述的通用方法。

Method: OpenVoxel 首先基于多视图图像获取稀疏体素表示（SVR），然后通过聚类将体素分组；接着使用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）对每组体素进行文本级描述，采用直接的文本到文本搜索策略，避免引入外部文本编码器的嵌入，从而实现端到端的开放词汇理解。

Result: 实验表明，OpenVoxel 在开放词汇分割（OVS）和复杂指代表达分割（RES）任务上显著优于现有方法，尤其在处理复杂语义查询时表现出更强的鲁棒性和准确性。其训练自由特性也降低了部署成本。

Conclusion: OpenVoxel 提供了一种高效、无需训练的开放词汇3D场景理解框架，通过直接利用MLLMs进行文本描述，实现了高质量的体素分组与语义标注，为后续3D理解任务提供了有力支持。

Abstract: We propose OpenVoxel, a training-free algorithm for grouping and captioning sparse voxels for the open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding tasks. Given the sparse voxel rasterization (SVR) model obtained from multi-view images of a 3D scene, our OpenVoxel is able to produce meaningful groups that describe different objects in the scene. Also, by leveraging powerful Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), our OpenVoxel successfully build an informative scene map by captioning each group, enabling further 3D scene understanding tasks such as open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) or referring expression segmentation (RES). Unlike previous methods, our method is training-free and does not introduce embeddings from a CLIP/BERT text encoder. Instead, we directly proceed with text-to-text search using MLLMs. Through extensive experiments, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to recent studies, particularly in complex referring expression segmentation (RES) tasks. The code will be open.

We outline the many challenges when going from an image of handwritten input to correctly placed informative error feedback. We empirically compare modular and end-to-end systems and find that both approaches currently do not achieve acceptable overall quality. We identify the major challenges and outline an agenda for future research.

*Emmanuele Barberi,Felice Sfravara,Filippo Cucinotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于微分熵的新度量方法，用于3D点云配准中的优化框架，称为迭代微分熵最小化（IDEM）。该方法不依赖于固定点云的选择，且在变换过程中能清晰地揭示最佳对齐状态的最小值。与传统的RMSE、Chamfer距离和Hausdorff距离相比，该方法在密度差异、噪声、孔洞和部分重叠等复杂情况下表现更优，尤其适用于双点云均存在质量问题的真实场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统点云配准方法如ICP依赖于欧氏距离，易受点云密度差异、噪声、孔洞和部分重叠的影响，且需指定一个固定点云，限制了其在真实复杂场景下的应用。因此需要一种不依赖固定点云、对各类退化情况更具鲁棒性的新度量方法。

Method: 提出基于微分熵的度量作为目标函数，构建迭代微分熵最小化（IDEM）算法，通过优化该度量实现点云间的刚性配准。该度量具有非对称性消除特性，无需固定参考点云，可在变换中找到明确的最优对齐点。

Result: 实验表明，所提方法在存在密度差异、噪声、孔洞及部分重叠的情况下，仍能获得优于RMSE、Chamfer距离和Hausdorff距离的配准结果，显示出更高的鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: 基于微分熵的配准方法（IDEM）是一种有效的新型配准策略，能够克服传统方法在点云质量不佳时的局限性，特别适用于真实世界中双点云均存在缺陷的复杂场景。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a central theme in computer vision, with alignment algorithms continuously improving for greater robustness. Commonly used methods evaluate Euclidean distances between point clouds and minimize an objective function, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). However, these approaches are most effective when the point clouds are well-prealigned and issues such as differences in density, noise, holes, and limited overlap can compromise the results. Traditional methods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP), require choosing one point cloud as fixed, since Euclidean distances lack commutativity. When only one point cloud has issues, adjustments can be made, but in real scenarios, both point clouds may be affected, often necessitating preprocessing. The authors introduce a novel differential entropy-based metric, designed to serve as the objective function within an optimization framework for fine rigid pairwise 3D point cloud registration, denoted as Iterative Differential Entropy Minimization (IDEM). This metric does not depend on the choice of a fixed point cloud and, during transformations, reveals a clear minimum corresponding to the best alignment. Multiple case studies are conducted, and the results are compared with those obtained using RMSE, Chamfer distance, and Hausdorff distance. The proposed metric proves effective even with density differences, noise, holes, and partial overlap, where RMSE does not always yield optimal alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MANGO是一种无配对图像翻译方法，通过分割条件的InfoNCE损失、高度正则化的判别器设计和修改的PatchNCE损失，有效解决仿真到现实（sim2real）中的视角一致性问题。仅需少量真实世界的固定摄像头数据，即可生成多样化的未见视角，显著提升模仿学习策略在新视角下的表现，成功率达60%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉的机器人操作策略在面对相机视角变化等分布偏移时仍脆弱；真实世界机器人演示数据稀缺且视角变化不足；虽然仿真可大规模收集带多视角的数据，但存在视觉上的sim2real挑战。因此需要一种方法来实现高质量的视角不变性图像转换。

Method: 提出MANGO方法，结合分割条件的InfoNCE损失、高度正则化的判别器设计以及改进的PatchNCE损失，以增强仿真与真实之间图像翻译的视角一致性。利用少量真实世界固定视角数据训练模型，从而生成多样化的未见视角仿真图像。

Result: MANGO在所有测试的图像翻译方法中表现最优；使用MANGO增强的数据训练的模仿学习策略，在原策略完全失败的新视角下实现了高达60%的成功率。

Conclusion: MANGO有效解决了仿真到现实中的视角不一致问题，通过少量真实数据即可生成多样化且视角一致的合成数据，显著提升了机器人在新视角下的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-based policies for robot manipulation have achieved significant recent success, but are still brittle to distribution shifts such as camera viewpoint variations. Robot demonstration data is scarce and often lacks appropriate variation in camera viewpoints. Simulation offers a way to collect robot demonstrations at scale with comprehensive coverage of different viewpoints, but presents a visual sim2real challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose MANGO -- an unpaired image translation method with a novel segmentation-conditioned InfoNCE loss, a highly-regularized discriminator design, and a modified PatchNCE loss. We find that these elements are crucial for maintaining viewpoint consistency during sim2real translation. When training MANGO, we only require a small amount of fixed-camera data from the real world, but show that our method can generate diverse unseen viewpoints by translating simulated observations. In this domain, MANGO outperforms all other image translation methods we tested. Imitation-learning policies trained on data augmented by MANGO are able to achieve success rates as high as 60\% on views that the non-augmented policy fails completely on.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出两阶段组间排序与校准框架（GRCF），通过动态边缘排名损失和MAE驱动目标，解决多模态情感分析中标签噪声敏感、相对顺序建模不足及绝对分数校准问题，显著提升回归与分类任务性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在多模态情感分析中依赖点式回归，易受标签噪声影响且忽略样本间相对正负关系，导致预测不稳定；虽有成对序数学习框架，但存在比较权重固定、静态排序边距等问题，无法自适应处理难排样本或不同语义距离。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段采用受GRPO启发的带优势加权的动态边缘排名损失，构建细粒度序数结构；第二阶段使用基于MAE的目标进行预测幅度校准，确保绝对得分准确性。

Result: GRCF在核心回归基准上达到最先进的性能，并在多模态幽默检测与讽刺检测等分类任务中展现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: GRCF有效解决了现有方法在序数建模与绝对评分校准中的关键缺陷，兼具稳定性与可扩展性，为多模态情感分析提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Most Multimodal Sentiment Analysis research has focused on point-wise regression. While straightforward, this approach is sensitive to label noise and neglects whether one sample is more positive than another, resulting in unstable predictions and poor correlation alignment. Pairwise ordinal learning frameworks emerged to address this gap, capturing relative order by learning from comparisons. Yet, they introduce two new trade-offs: First, they assign uniform importance to all comparisons, failing to adaptively focus on hard-to-rank samples. Second, they employ static ranking margins, which fail to reflect the varying semantic distances between sentiment groups. To address this, we propose a Two-Stage Group-wise Ranking and Calibration Framework (GRCF) that adapts the philosophy of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our framework resolves these trade-offs by simultaneously preserving relative ordinal structure, ensuring absolute score calibration, and adaptively focusing on difficult samples. Specifically, Stage 1 introduces a GRPO-inspired Advantage-Weighted Dynamic Margin Ranking Loss to build a fine-grained ordinal structure. Stage 2 then employs an MAE-driven objective to align prediction magnitudes. To validate its generalizability, we extend GRCF to classification tasks, including multimodal humor detection and sarcasm detection. GRCF achieves state-of-the-art performance on core regression benchmarks, while also showing strong generalizability in classification tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有铁路安全系统多局限于固定视野内的物体分类和基于规则的侵入判断，忽视潜在侵入风险目标。准确识别和预测潜在侵入行为需要对目标对象（OOI）的空间上下文和时间动态进行认知理解，传统视觉模型难以满足这一需求。因此，亟需具备时空推理能力的新型感知系统。

Method: 构建了包含多源数据与认知问答标注的CogRail基准；采用多模态提示对SOTA视觉语言模型进行评估；设计联合微调框架，整合位置感知、运动预测与威胁分析三任务，实现通用基础模型向专用认知侵入感知模型的有效迁移。

Result: 现有大规模多模态模型在复杂时空推理任务中表现不佳，暴露出其在安全关键场景下的局限性；所提出的联合微调框架显著提升模型性能，同时增强可解释性，证明结构化多任务学习在特定领域适应中的有效性。

Conclusion: 为实现铁路系统中精准且早期的侵入感知，必须突破传统方法的局限，引入具备时空推理能力的认知模型。本文提出的CogRail基准与联合微调框架为该方向提供了有效路径，未来工作将聚焦于进一步优化模型泛化能力与实时性。

Abstract: Accurate and early perception of potential intrusion targets is essential for ensuring the safety of railway transportation systems. However, most existing systems focus narrowly on object classification within fixed visual scopes and apply rule-based heuristics to determine intrusion status, often overlooking targets that pose latent intrusion risks. Anticipating such risks requires the cognition of spatial context and temporal dynamics for the object of interest (OOI), which presents challenges for conventional visual models. To facilitate deep intrusion perception, we introduce a novel benchmark, CogRail, which integrates curated open-source datasets with cognitively driven question-answer annotations to support spatio-temporal reasoning and prediction. Building upon this benchmark, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art visual-language models (VLMs) using multimodal prompts to identify their strengths and limitations in this domain. Furthermore, we fine-tune VLMs for better performance and propose a joint fine-tuning framework that integrates three core tasks, position perception, movement prediction, and threat analysis, facilitating effective adaptation of general-purpose foundation models into specialized models tailored for cognitive intrusion perception. Extensive experiments reveal that current large-scale multimodal models struggle with the complex spatial-temporal reasoning required by the cognitive intrusion perception task, underscoring the limitations of existing foundation models in this safety-critical domain. In contrast, our proposed joint fine-tuning framework significantly enhances model performance by enabling targeted adaptation to domain-specific reasoning demands, highlighting the advantages of structured multi-task learning in improving both accuracy and interpretability. Code will be available at https://github.com/Hub-Tian/CogRail.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文揭示了文本到图像（T2I）模型投票排行榜中的匿名性漏洞，发现不同模型生成的图像在图像嵌入空间中形成独特的聚类，可通过中心点法实现高精度去匿名化，且无需提示词控制或训练数据。研究使用22个模型和280个提示词（共15万张图像），提出提示级别可区分性度量，并发现某些提示词可导致近乎完美的模型区分。结果暴露了T2I排行榜的根本安全缺陷，呼吁加强匿名化防护措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于投票的T2I模型排行榜依赖于模型输出的匿名性以确保公平性，但本文旨在探究这种匿名性是否真正可靠，揭示其潜在的安全风险。

Method: 采用基于图像嵌入空间的中心点法，通过分析各模型生成图像的分布特征，识别模型特异性模式；引入提示级别可区分性度量，进行大规模实验分析不同提示对模型区分效果的影响。

Result: 在22个模型、280个提示词（15万张图像）的数据集上，该方法实现了高精度的模型去匿名化，部分提示下甚至达到接近100%的区分准确率，验证了模型生成行为具有系统性签名。

Conclusion: 现有T2I排行榜的匿名机制存在严重安全隐患，模型生成图像具有可被精确识别的系统性特征，亟需更强的匿名化防御策略以保障评估公平性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are increasingly popular, producing a large share of AI-generated images online. To compare model quality, voting-based leaderboards have become the standard, relying on anonymized model outputs for fairness. In this work, we show that such anonymity can be easily broken. We find that generations from each T2I model form distinctive clusters in the image embedding space, enabling accurate deanonymization without prompt control or training data. Using 22 models and 280 prompts (150K images), our centroid-based method achieves high accuracy and reveals systematic model-specific signatures. We further introduce a prompt-level distinguishability metric and conduct large-scale analyses showing how certain prompts can lead to near-perfect distinguishability. Our findings expose fundamental security flaws in T2I leaderboards and motivate stronger anonymization defenses.

Trained and evaluated in the FishTrack23 dataset, AquaFeat+ achieves significant improvements in object detection, classification, and tracking metrics, validating its effectiveness for enhancing perception tasks in underwater robotic applications.

Motivation: 现有方法面临缺乏图像到物理的数据集以及问题本身的病态性挑战，且通常需要多视角捕捉或昂贵的可微分模拟，或仅预测几何而忽略材料属性。因此亟需一种无需复杂流程、能直接生成仿真可用服装的新方法。

Method: 首先微调一个视觉-语言模型以从真实图像中推断材料成分与织物属性；随后训练一个轻量级预测器，基于少量材料物理测量数据，将这些属性转换为物理参数；整个过程为前馈结构，无需迭代优化。

Abstract: Estimating physically accurate, simulation-ready garments from a single image is challenging due to the absence of image-to-physics datasets and the ill-posed nature of this problem. Prior methods either require multi-view capture and expensive differentiable simulation or predict only garment geometry without the material properties required for realistic simulation. We propose a feed-forward framework that sidesteps these limitations by first fine-tuning a vision-language model to infer material composition and fabric attributes from real images, and then training a lightweight predictor that maps these attributes to the corresponding physical fabric parameters using a small dataset of material-physics measurements. Our approach introduces two new datasets (FTAG and T2P) and delivers simulation-ready garments from a single image without iterative optimization. Experiments show that our estimator achieves superior accuracy in material composition estimation and fabric attribute prediction, and by passing them through our physics parameter estimator, we further achieve higher-fidelity simulations compared to state-of-the-art image-to-garment methods.

TL;DR: LiteEmbed 是一种轻量级框架，用于 CLIP 模型的少样本个性化，能够在不重新训练编码器的情况下添加新类别。它通过主成分分析（PCA）分解文本嵌入，分离粗粒度语义方向与细粒度差异，利用粗对齐和细分离两个互补目标，在保持全局语义一致性的同时增强视觉相似类别的区分能力。优化后的嵌入可即插即用，适用于分类、检索、分割和检测等多种任务，显著优于现有方法，有效提升 CLIP 对低频、罕见或未见类别的适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP 等大规模视觉语言模型在零样本识别上表现良好，但在预训练中罕见的类别（如新兴实体或文化特有类别）上表现不佳。需要一种无需重训练即可快速适应新类别的轻量级个性化方法。

Method: LiteEmbed 采用基于 PCA 的子空间引导优化，对 CLIP 的文本嵌入进行微调，分离粗粒度语义与细粒度变化，通过粗对齐与细分离双重目标实现语义一致性与判别力的平衡。优化后嵌入可直接替换原模型文本特征，支持多任务部署。

Conclusion: LiteEmbed 为 CLIP 提供了一种高效、轻量且通用的少样本个性化方案，能够有效应对低频、罕见或未见类别的挑战，具备良好的可扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot recognition but struggle with classes that are rarely seen during pretraining, including newly emerging entities and culturally specific categories. We introduce LiteEmbed, a lightweight framework for few-shot personalization of CLIP that enables new classes to be added without retraining its encoders. LiteEmbed performs subspace-guided optimization of text embeddings within CLIP's vocabulary, leveraging a PCA-based decomposition that disentangles coarse semantic directions from fine-grained variations. Two complementary objectives, coarse alignment and fine separation, jointly preserve global semantic consistency while enhancing discriminability among visually similar classes. Once optimized, the embeddings are plug-and-play, seamlessly substituting CLIP's original text features across classification, retrieval, segmentation, and detection tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial gains over prior methods, establishing LiteEmbed as an effective approach for adapting CLIP to underrepresented, rare, or unseen classes.

### [56] [SCE-SLAM: Scale-Consistent Monocular SLAM via Scene Coordinate Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09665)
*Yuchen Wu,Jiahe Li,Xiaohan Yu,Lina Yu,Jin Zheng,Xiao Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCE-SLAM is an end-to-end monocular visual SLAM system that tackles scale drift in long sequences by using scene coordinate embeddings to maintain scale consistency. It introduces geometry-guided aggregation and scene coordinate bundle adjustment to propagate scale information and anchor estimates to a canonical scale, achieving significant improvements in accuracy while maintaining real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular visual SLAM suffers from scale drift over long sequences due to the lack of global constraints in frame-to-frame methods, limiting its use in large-scale applications like 3D reconstruction and autonomous navigation.

Method: SCE-SLAM uses scene coordinate embeddings—patch-level representations encoding 3D geometric relationships under a canonical scale reference. It includes geometry-guided aggregation with geometry-modulated attention to propagate scale information from past observations, and scene coordinate bundle adjustment to enforce 3D coordinate constraints derived from embeddings, ensuring scale consistency.

Result: On KITTI, SCE-SLAM reduces absolute trajectory error by 8.36m compared to the best prior method; it maintains 36 FPS and achieves scale consistency across large-scale scenes, validated on KITTI, Waymo, and vKITTI datasets.

Conclusion: SCE-SLAM effectively mitigates scale drift in monocular visual SLAM by leveraging learned scene coordinate embeddings and geometric constraints, enabling accurate, real-time 3D reconstruction and navigation on resource-constrained platforms.

Abstract: Monocular visual SLAM enables 3D reconstruction from internet video and autonomous navigation on resource-constrained platforms, yet suffers from scale drift, i.e., the gradual divergence of estimated scale over long sequences. Existing frame-to-frame methods achieve real-time performance through local optimization but accumulate scale drift due to the lack of global constraints among independent windows. To address this, we propose SCE-SLAM, an end-to-end SLAM system that maintains scale consistency through scene coordinate embeddings, which are learned patch-level representations encoding 3D geometric relationships under a canonical scale reference. The framework consists of two key modules: geometry-guided aggregation that leverages 3D spatial proximity to propagate scale information from historical observations through geometry-modulated attention, and scene coordinate bundle adjustment that anchors current estimates to the reference scale through explicit 3D coordinate constraints decoded from the scene coordinate embeddings. Experiments on KITTI, Waymo, and vKITTI demonstrate substantial improvements: our method reduces absolute trajectory error by 8.36m on KITTI compared to the best prior approach, while maintaining 36 FPS and achieving scale consistency across large-scale scenes.

Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型虽性能强大，但体积庞大、计算成本高，难以在资源受限场景中部署。亟需一种兼具前沿性能与高效轻量化特性的模型，以平衡性能与实用性，推动多模态智能的普及应用。

Method: 采用统一且全未冻结的预训练策略，在1.2万亿多模态数据上训练，结合语言对齐的视觉编码器与Qwen3-8B解码器，建立内在的视觉-语言协同；通过超过1000轮强化学习的后训练流程提升能力；引入并行协同推理（PaCoRe）机制，实现测试阶段的可扩展感知推理，动态探索和整合多样视觉假设。

Abstract: We present STEP3-VL-10B, a lightweight open-source foundation model designed to redefine the trade-off between compact efficiency and frontier-level multimodal intelligence. STEP3-VL-10B is realized through two strategic shifts: first, a unified, fully unfrozen pre-training strategy on 1.2T multimodal tokens that integrates a language-aligned Perception Encoder with a Qwen3-8B decoder to establish intrinsic vision-language synergy; and second, a scaled post-training pipeline featuring over 1k iterations of reinforcement learning. Crucially, we implement Parallel Coordinated Reasoning (PaCoRe) to scale test-time compute, allocating resources to scalable perceptual reasoning that explores and synthesizes diverse visual hypotheses. Consequently, despite its compact 10B footprint, STEP3-VL-10B rivals or surpasses models 10$\times$-20$\times$ larger (e.g., GLM-4.6V-106B, Qwen3-VL-235B) and top-tier proprietary flagships like Gemini 2.5 Pro and Seed-1.5-VL. Delivering best-in-class performance, it records 92.2% on MMBench and 80.11% on MMMU, while excelling in complex reasoning with 94.43% on AIME2025 and 75.95% on MathVision. We release the full model suite to provide the community with a powerful, efficient, and reproducible baseline.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的视频生成方法计算效率低下，生成几秒视频需数分钟GPU时间，难以应用于需要实时交互的应用场景，如虚拟现实、增强现实和具身人工智能。因此亟需一种更高效的生成策略。

Abstract: Modern video generative models based on diffusion models can produce very realistic clips, but they are computationally inefficient, often requiring minutes of GPU time for just a few seconds of video. This inefficiency poses a critical barrier to deploying generative video in applications that require real-time interactions, such as embodied AI and VR/AR. This paper explores a new strategy for camera-conditioned video generation of static scenes: using diffusion-based generative models to generate a sparse set of keyframes, and then synthesizing the full video through 3D reconstruction and rendering. By lifting keyframes into a 3D representation and rendering intermediate views, our approach amortizes the generation cost across hundreds of frames while enforcing geometric consistency. We further introduce a model that predicts the optimal number of keyframes for a given camera trajectory, allowing the system to adaptively allocate computation. Our final method, SRENDER, uses very sparse keyframes for simple trajectories and denser ones for complex camera motion. This results in video generation that is more than 40 times faster than the diffusion-based baseline in generating 20 seconds of video, while maintaining high visual fidelity and temporal stability, offering a practical path toward efficient and controllable video synthesis.

*Tony Danjun Wang,Tolga Birdal,Nassir Navab,Lennart Bastian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COMPOSE提出一种新的超图划分方法来解决多视角3D姿态对应匹配问题，通过几何剪枝有效降低搜索空间，相比以往优化方法提升最高达23%的平均精度，比自监督端到端学习方法提升最高11%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖成对关联建模多视角对应关系，将全局一致性（如循环一致性）作为软约束，但在多视角情况下容易因错误传播导致结果不稳定。

Method: 将多视角姿态对应匹配建模为超图划分问题，并引入高效的几何剪枝策略以减少整数线性规划的搜索空间。

Result: 在平均精度上相比优化方法最多提升23%，相比自监督端到端学习方法最多提升11%。

Conclusion: COMPOSE提供了一种高效且鲁棒的多视角3D姿态估计解决方案，显著提升了对应匹配的准确性和系统稳定性。

Abstract: 3D pose estimation from sparse multi-views is a critical task for numerous applications, including action recognition, sports analysis, and human-robot interaction. Optimization-based methods typically follow a two-stage pipeline, first detecting 2D keypoints in each view and then associating these detections across views to triangulate the 3D pose. Existing methods rely on mere pairwise associations to model this correspondence problem, treating global consistency between views (i.e., cycle consistency) as a soft constraint. Yet, reconciling these constraints for multiple views becomes brittle when spurious associations propagate errors. We thus propose COMPOSE, a novel framework that formulates multi-view pose correspondence matching as a hypergraph partitioning problem rather than through pairwise association. While the complexity of the resulting integer linear program grows exponentially in theory, we introduce an efficient geometric pruning strategy to substantially reduce the search space. COMPOSE achieves improvements of up to 23% in average precision over previous optimization-based methods and up to 11% over self-supervised end-to-end learned methods, offering a promising solution to a widely studied problem.

*Ruiqi Shen,Chang Liu,Henghui Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SAM3-DMS，一种无需训练的解耦记忆选择策略，通过细粒度个体对象记忆选择提升复杂多目标场景下的视频分割性能，尤其在目标密度高时优势显著，实现更稳定的跟踪与身份保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM3在多目标场景下因同步决策机制依赖平均表现，导致个体可靠性被忽视，影响记忆选择效果，因此需要改进以适应复杂场景。

Method: 提出一种无需训练的解耦策略，对每个目标进行独立的细粒度记忆选择，避免群体平均带来的偏差，提升个体追踪可靠性。

Result: 实验表明该方法在多目标密集场景下显著提升身份保持与跟踪稳定性，尤其在目标密度增加时表现更优。

Conclusion: SAM3-DMS为真实世界中同时进行多目标视频分割提供了坚实基础，尤其适用于高密度复杂场景。

Abstract: Segment Anything 3 (SAM3) has established a powerful foundation that robustly detects, segments, and tracks specified targets in videos. However, in its original implementation, its group-level collective memory selection is suboptimal for complex multi-object scenarios, as it employs a synchronized decision across all concurrent targets conditioned on their average performance, often overlooking individual reliability. To this end, we propose SAM3-DMS, a training-free decoupled strategy that utilizes fine-grained memory selection on individual objects. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves robust identity preservation and tracking stability. Notably, our advantage becomes more pronounced with increased target density, establishing a solid foundation for simultaneous multi-target video segmentation in the wild.

### [61] [Fast-ThinkAct: Efficient Vision-Language-Action Reasoning via Verbalizable Latent Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09708)
*Chi-Pin Huang,Yunze Man,Zhiding Yu,Min-Hung Chen,Jan Kautz,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang,Fu-En Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fast-ThinkAct 是一种高效的视觉-语言-动作（VLA）推理框架，通过可表述的潜在思维链（latent CoT）实现紧凑而高性能的规划。该方法通过从教师模型中蒸馏学习，采用偏好引导的目标来对齐操作轨迹，从而在保持语言和视觉规划能力的同时，提升具身控制中的推理与行动衔接效率。实验表明，Fast-ThinkAct 在多个具身操作与推理基准上实现了高达89.3%的推理延迟降低，同时保持了长时程规划、少样本适应和故障恢复能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于显式链式思维（CoT）的视觉-语言-动作（VLA）方法虽能提升泛化能力，但因推理过程冗长导致高推理延迟，限制其在动态环境中的实时应用。因此，亟需一种既能保持性能又具备高效推理能力的新型框架。

Method: 提出 Fast-ThinkAct 框架，利用从教师模型蒸馏得到的可表述潜在思维链（latent CoT），结合偏好引导的目标函数优化操作轨迹对齐，实现紧凑推理与动作执行之间的高效连接。

Result: 在多个具身操作与推理基准测试中，Fast-ThinkAct 实现了最高达 89.3% 的推理延迟降低，同时保持了优秀的长时程规划、少样本适应和失败恢复能力，显著优于当前最先进的推理型 VLA 方法。

Conclusion: Fast-ThinkAct 成功实现了高效且强大的具身推理与控制，为复杂动态环境中实时智能体决策提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) tasks require reasoning over complex visual scenes and executing adaptive actions in dynamic environments. While recent studies on reasoning VLAs show that explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) can improve generalization, they suffer from high inference latency due to lengthy reasoning traces. We propose Fast-ThinkAct, an efficient reasoning framework that achieves compact yet performant planning through verbalizable latent reasoning. Fast-ThinkAct learns to reason efficiently with latent CoTs by distilling from a teacher, driven by a preference-guided objective to align manipulation trajectories that transfers both linguistic and visual planning capabilities for embodied control. This enables reasoning-enhanced policy learning that effectively connects compact reasoning to action execution. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied manipulation and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-ThinkAct achieves strong performance with up to 89.3\% reduced inference latency over state-of-the-art reasoning VLAs, while maintaining effective long-horizon planning, few-shot adaptation, and failure recovery.

### [62] [DeliberationBench: When Do More Voices Hurt? A Controlled Study of Multi-LLM Deliberation Protocols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08835)
*Vaarunay Kaushal,Taranveer Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DELIBERATIONBENCH基准测试表明，简单的从模型输出中选择最佳答案的基线方法在82.5%的准确率上显著优于复杂的多智能体辩论协议（仅13.8%），且性能差距达6倍，同时计算成本更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估多智能体系统中大型语言模型辩论协议的实际价值，检验其是否真的优于简单但高效的基线方法。

Method: 构建了控制性基准DELIBERATIONBENCH，对三种辩论协议与强基线（选择最优输出）进行对比，在270个问题上进行三次独立实验，共810次评估。

Result: 最佳单个输出基线胜率为82.5% ± 3.3%，而最佳辩论协议仅为13.8% ± 2.6%，性能差距显著（p < 0.01），且计算开销高出1.5至2.5倍。

Conclusion: 复杂多智能体辩论机制并未提升性能，反而显著增加成本，挑战了‘复杂即更好’的假设，表明简单方法在实际应用中更具优势。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems where Large Language Models (LLMs) deliberate to form consensus have gained significant attention, yet their practical value over simpler methods remains under-scrutinized. We introduce DELIBERATIONBENCH, a controlled benchmark evaluating three deliberation protocols against a strong baseline of selecting the best response from a pool of model outputs. Across 270 questions and three independent seeds (810 total evaluations), we find a striking negative result: the best-single baseline achieves an 82.5% +- 3.3% win rate, dramatically outperforming the best deliberation protocol(13.8% +- 2.6%). This 6.0x performance gap is statistically significant (p < 0.01) and comes at 1.5-2.5x higher computational cost. Our findings challenge assumptions that complexity enhances quality in multi-LLM systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨PTSD与慢性疾病共病在社交媒体上的表现，以揭示其独特挑战，并利用数字平台数据改进诊断与干预策略。

Method: 系统性文献回顾（2008-2024），结合自然语言处理与机器学习分析社交媒体文本数据。

Result: 社交媒体数据能有效揭示共病群体的困境；NLP/ML可高效识别潜在PTSD案例，准确率达74%-90%；在线支持社区对心理调适和早期干预具有积极影响。

Conclusion: 需在PTSD研究与治疗中考虑既往慢性病背景，社交媒体可作为监测与支持工具，未来应发展针对性干预措施。

Abstract: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a multifaceted mental health condition, particularly challenging for individuals with pre-existing medical conditions. This review critically examines the intersection of PTSD and chronic illnesses as expressed on social media platforms. By systematically analyzing literature from 2008 to 2024, the study explores how PTSD manifests and is managed in individuals with chronic conditions such as cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune disorders, with a focus on online expressions on platforms like X (formally known as Twitter) and Facebook. Findings demonstrate that social media data offers valuable insights into the unique challenges faced by individuals with both PTSD and chronic illnesses. Specifically, natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques can identify potential PTSD cases among these populations, achieving accuracy rates between 74% and 90%. Furthermore, the role of online support communities in shaping coping strategies and facilitating early interventions is highlighted. This review underscores the necessity of incorporating considerations of pre-existing medical conditions in PTSD research and treatment, emphasizing social media's potential as a monitoring and support tool for vulnerable groups. Future research directions and clinical implications are also discussed, with an emphasis on developing targeted interventions.

### [64] [From Adversarial Poetry to Adversarial Tales: An Interpretability Research Agenda](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08837)
*Piercosma Bisconti,Marcello Galisai,Matteo Prandi,Federico Pierucci,Olga Sorokoletova,Francesco Giarrusso,Vincenzo Suriani,Marcantonio Brancale,Daniele Nardi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Adversarial Tales is a jailbreak technique that embeds harmful content in cyberpunk narratives, using structural analysis inspired by Propp's folktale morphology to trick LLMs into reconstructing harmful procedures as legitimate interpretations. It achieves an average success rate of 71.3% across 26 models from nine providers, highlighting a systemic vulnerability in current safety mechanisms. Combined with prior work on Adversarial Poetry, this suggests structurally-grounded attacks form a broad and persistent threat class. The authors call for mechanistic interpretability research to understand how narrative cues influence model behavior and whether models can detect harm independent of surface form.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety mechanisms in large language models are vulnerable to attacks that reframe harmful requests using culturally coded structures, such as narratives. This study aims to expose and understand a new class of jailbreaks that exploit the structural interpretation capabilities of LLMs, particularly through storytelling frameworks like cyberpunk narratives and Propp’s folktale morphology.

Method: The method involves embedding harmful content within cyberpunk-style stories and prompting models to perform functional analysis based on Vladimir Propp's narrative structure theory. By framing the request as a structural decomposition task, the attack bypasses surface-level content filters and induces models to reconstruct harmful procedures as part of narrative interpretation.

Result: The attack achieved an average success rate of 71.3% across 26 frontier models from nine different providers, with no model family demonstrating consistent resistance. This indicates that existing safety measures are insufficient against structurally grounded jailbreaks.

Conclusion: Structurally-grounded jailbreaks, exemplified by Adversarial Tales and previously by Adversarial Poetry, represent a broad and persistent vulnerability class in LLM safety. Defenses relying solely on pattern matching are inadequate. Future research must focus on mechanistic interpretability to understand how narrative cues alter model representations and whether models can identify harmful intent regardless of linguistic form.

Abstract: Safety mechanisms in LLMs remain vulnerable to attacks that reframe harmful requests through culturally coded structures. We introduce Adversarial Tales, a jailbreak technique that embeds harmful content within cyberpunk narratives and prompts models to perform functional analysis inspired by Vladimir Propp's morphology of folktales. By casting the task as structural decomposition, the attack induces models to reconstruct harmful procedures as legitimate narrative interpretation. Across 26 frontier models from nine providers, we observe an average attack success rate of 71.3%, with no model family proving reliably robust. Together with our prior work on Adversarial Poetry, these findings suggest that structurally-grounded jailbreaks constitute a broad vulnerability class rather than isolated techniques. The space of culturally coded frames that can mediate harmful intent is vast, likely inexhaustible by pattern-matching defenses alone. Understanding why these attacks succeed is therefore essential: we outline a mechanistic interpretability research agenda to investigate how narrative cues reshape model representations and whether models can learn to recognize harmful intent independently of surface form.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种三智能体交叉验证框架，用于分析多模型大语言系统中的稳定性和可解释性。该框架整合三个异构LLM（语义生成、分析一致性检查、透明度审计），形成递归交互循环，实现递归知识合成（RKS）。在47次受控实验中，系统在公开部署环境下表现出良好稳定性：平均反射可靠性得分（RRS）为0.78±0.06，透明度得分（TS）在约68%的试验中≥0.8，89%的试验收敛，验证了透明度审计作为收缩算子的有效性。贡献包括：(1) 异构LLM协同推理的结构化框架；(2) 基于不动点理论的RKS形式化模型；(3) 在真实非API公开环境下的跨模型稳定性实证评估。结果表明，安全保持、人类监督的多LLM架构可在现实环境中实现稳定的递归知识合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在多模型协作中缺乏对稳定性与可解释性的有效保障，尤其在公开部署环境下难以保证推理一致性与透明性。亟需一种能实现跨模型协同、自我校验且可解释的系统架构。

Method: 构建三智能体交叉验证框架，包含语义生成、分析一致性检查和透明度审计三个异构LLM，通过递归交互实现知识迭代优化。引入递归知识合成（RKS）模型，基于固定点理论进行形式化建模，并在47次公开部署实验中评估系统稳定性。

Result: 系统在47次受控试验中平均反射可靠性得分（RRS）为0.78±0.06，透明度得分（TS）在68%的试验中≥0.8，89%的试验实现收敛，验证了透明度审计作为收缩算子的作用，支持递归知识合成的稳定性。

Conclusion: 本研究验证了在真实公开部署环境下，通过人类监督与多模型协同，可实现稳定、可解释的递归知识合成。提出的三智能体框架与RKS模型为构建安全可信的多模型大语言系统提供了可行路径。

Abstract: This paper presents a tri-agent cross-validation framework for analyzing stability and explainability in multi-model large language systems. The architecture integrates three heterogeneous LLMs-used for semantic generation, analytical consistency checking, and transparency auditing-into a recursive interaction cycle. This design induces Recursive Knowledge Synthesis (RKS), where intermediate representations are continuously refined through mutually constraining transformations irreducible to single-model behavior. Across 47 controlled trials using public-access LLM deployments (October 2025), we evaluated system stability via four metrics: Reflex Reliability Score (RRS), Transparency Score (TS), Deviation Detection Rate (DDR), and Correction Success Rate (CSR). The system achieved mean RRS = 0.78+-0.06 and maintained TS >= 0.8 in about 68% of trials. Approximately 89% of trials converged, supporting the theoretical prediction that transparency auditing acts as a contraction operator within the composite validation mapping. The contributions are threefold: (1) a structured tri-agent framework for coordinated reasoning across heterogeneous LLMs, (2) a formal RKS model grounded in fixed-point theory, and (3) empirical evaluation of inter-model stability under realistic, non-API public-access conditions. These results provide initial empirical evidence that a safety-preserving, humansupervised multi-LLM architecture can achieve stable recursive knowledge synthesis in realistic, publicly deployed environments.

*Xiaoqi Han,Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto,Ru Li,Xiaoli Li,Jiye Liang,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为一致性感知编辑（CAE）的新框架，用于高效且有效地实现大语言模型中的实体级遗忘。该方法通过聚合与目标实体相关的多样化提示（包括属性、关系和对抗性改写），并利用一致性正则化联合学习一个低秩更新，以确保不同提示间的编辑方向一致，从而实现全面且鲁棒的遗忘，同时最小化对无关知识的干扰。实验表明，CAE在两个基准测试中显著优于传统方法，在遗忘准确性和鲁棒性方面表现优异，并仅需数十个精心选择的提示即可实现可扩展的实体删除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有实体级遗忘方法依赖全模型微调或基于提示的干预，存在计算成本高或对改写查询不鲁棒的问题；而现有模型编辑技术多针对实例级更新，无法有效消除与特定实体相关的全部知识。因此需要一种高效、鲁棒且可扩展的实体级遗忘方法。

Method: 提出一致性感知编辑（CAE）框架，通过聚合多样化的实体相关提示（包括属性、关系和对抗性改写），使用一致性正则化引导低秩更新，使不同提示下的编辑方向保持一致，从而实现全面遗忘并减少对其他知识的影响。

Result: 在RWKU和ToFU两个挑战性基准上，CAE显著提升了遗忘准确性和鲁棒性，优于传统未学习和编辑基线；同时验证了仅需几十个精心挑选的提示即可实现大规模实体删除，具备良好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: CAE为实体级遗忘提供了一种高效、鲁棒且可扩展的新范式，揭示了实体知识在模型内部的表征与删除机制，并为未来可控知识管理提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) risk retaining sensitive, copyrighted, or harmful information from their training data. Entity-level unlearning addresses this issue by removing all knowledge of a specific entity while preserving the model's overall capabilities. Existing approaches typically rely on full-model fine-tuning or prompt-based interventions, which can be computationally expensive or brittle when handling paraphrased queries. Recently, model editing has emerged as an efficient alternative for updating knowledge in LLMs, offering a promising direction for unlearning. However, existing editing techniques are typically designed for instance-level updates, modifying responses to specific attributes of an entity rather than eliminating all knowledge associated with the entity. In this paper, we investigate how editing techniques can be adapted for effective and efficient entity-level unlearning. To this end, we introduce a novel consistency-aware editing (CAE) framework. CAE aggregates a diverse set of prompts related to a target entity, including its attributes, relations, and adversarial paraphrases. It then jointly learns a low-rank update guided by a consistency regularizer that aligns the editing directions across prompts. This promotes robust and comprehensive forgetting while minimizing interference with unrelated knowledge. We further examine where different entities are stored within the model and how many diverse prompts are needed for successful unlearning. We evaluate CAE on two challenging benchmarks, RWKU and ToFU, and demonstrate that it (i) provides insights into how entity-level knowledge is internally represented and deleted in LLMs, (ii) significantly improves forgetting accuracy and robustness over traditional unlearning and editing baselines, and (iii) enables scalable entity removal using only tens of carefully selected prompts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着科学文献数量和复杂性的增加，传统方法难以有效组织和理解研究文档，亟需更智能的文本处理技术。现有方法多依赖纯文本信息，忽视了可提取的结构化知识（如三元组）在增强语义表达中的潜力。因此，探索如何将结构化知识融入文本表示，以提升文献聚类与分类效果，具有重要意义。

Method: 提出一个模块化管道，包含四个步骤：1）从arXiv摘要中提取主谓宾三元组；2）构建四种文本表示形式（原始摘要、仅三元组、仅文本、混合）；3）使用四种Transformer模型（MiniLM、MPNet、SciBERT、SPECTER）对各表示进行嵌入；4）分别采用KMeans、GMM、HDBSCAN进行无监督聚类，以及微调分类模型进行arXiv主题预测。

Result: 纯摘要文本生成最一致的聚类结果；混合表示（融合三元组与文本）显著提升分类性能，最高达到92.6%准确率和0.925宏F1值；轻量级模型（MiniLM、MPNet）在聚类任务中表现更好，而领域专用模型（SciBERT、SPECTER）在结构化输入分类中更具优势。

Conclusion: 将非结构化文本与结构化知识相结合，能够互补提升科学文献的语义组织能力。未来可通过进一步优化三元组提取与融合策略，推动知识驱动的文献智能管理发展。

Abstract: The increasing volume and complexity of scientific literature demand robust methods for organizing and understanding research documents. In this study, we explore how structured knowledge, specifically, subject-predicate-object triples, can enhance the clustering and classification of scientific papers. We propose a modular pipeline that combines unsupervised clustering and supervised classification over multiple document representations: raw abstracts, extracted triples, and hybrid formats that integrate both. Using a filtered arXiv corpus, we extract relational triples from abstracts and construct four text representations, which we embed using four state-of-the-art transformer models: MiniLM, MPNet, SciBERT, and SPECTER. We evaluate the resulting embeddings with KMeans, GMM, and HDBSCAN for unsupervised clustering, and fine-tune classification models for arXiv subject prediction. Our results show that full abstract text yields the most coherent clusters, but that hybrid representations incorporating triples consistently improve classification performance, reaching up to 92.6% accuracy and 0.925 macro-F1. We also find that lightweight sentence encoders (MiniLM, MPNet) outperform domain-specific models (SciBERT, SPECTER) in clustering, while SciBERT excels in structured-input classification. These findings highlight the complementary benefits of combining unstructured text with structured knowledge, offering new insights into knowledge-infused representations for semantic organization of scientific documents.

*Haotian Deng,Chris Farber,Jiyoon Lee,David Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates LLMs for rubric-based short-answer grading, finding strong alignment in simple tasks but degradation with complexity. A deferral mechanism improves accuracy by filtering uncertain predictions. The model is robust to prompt injection but vulnerable to synonym substitution, underscoring the need for careful assessment before deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated short-answer grading (ASAG) is challenging due to linguistic variability and the need for nuanced, rubric-aligned partial credit. Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise but require rigorous evaluation for reliability in rubric-based settings.

Method: Systematically evaluate LLM-judges using the SciEntsBank benchmark and Qwen 2.5-72B, focusing on alignment with expert judgment across rubric complexities, trade-off between uncertainty and accuracy via a consensus-based deferral mechanism, and robustness under perturbations and adversarial attacks.

Result: LLM grading shows strong alignment with expert judgment in binary tasks but degrades with increased rubric granularity. The 'Trust Curve' reveals that filtering low-confidence predictions improves accuracy. The model is resilient to prompt injection but sensitive to synonym substitutions.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of uncertainty estimation and robustness testing for reliable deployment of rubric-conditioned LLM judges, providing critical insights into their capabilities and limitations.

Abstract: Automated short-answer grading (ASAG) remains a challenging task due to the linguistic variability of student responses and the need for nuanced, rubric-aligned partial credit. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution, their reliability as automated judges in rubric-based settings requires rigorous assessment. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the performance of LLM-judges for rubric-based short-answer grading. We investigate three key aspects: the alignment of LLM grading with expert judgment across varying rubric complexities, the trade-off between uncertainty and accuracy facilitated by a consensus-based deferral mechanism, and the model's robustness under random input perturbations and adversarial attacks. Using the SciEntsBank benchmark and Qwen 2.5-72B, we find that alignment is strong for binary tasks but degrades with increased rubric granularity. Our "Trust Curve" analysis demonstrates a clear trade-off where filtering low-confidence predictions improves accuracy on the remaining subset. Additionally, robustness experiments reveal that while the model is resilient to prompt injection, it is sensitive to synonym substitutions. Our work provides critical insights into the capabilities and limitations of rubric-conditioned LLM judges, highlighting the importance of uncertainty estimation and robustness testing for reliable deployment.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised concerns about their enormous carbon footprint, starting with energy-intensive training and continuing through repeated inference. This study investigates the potential of using fine-tuned Small Language Models (SLMs) as a sustainable alternative for predefined tasks. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the performance-emissions trade-off between LLMs and fine-tuned SLMs across selected tasks under Natural Language Processing, Reasoning and Programming. Our results show that in four out of the six selected tasks, SLMs maintained comparable performances for a significant reduction in carbon emissions during inference. Our findings demonstrate the viability of smaller models in mitigating the environmental impact of resource-heavy LLMs, thus advancing towards sustainable, green AI.

TL;DR: InftyThink with Cross-Chain Memory enhances iterative reasoning in LLMs by using a semantic cache to retrieve past successful reasoning patterns, improving accuracy in structured tasks while revealing limitations in heterogeneous domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of repeated regeneration of similar reasoning strategies across tasks in iterative summarization frameworks, which limits adaptability and efficiency.

Method: Introduces a semantic cache based on embeddings to store and retrieve previously successful reasoning lemmas, guiding current reasoning steps without expanding context indiscriminately.

Result: Improved accuracy on structured benchmarks (MATH500, AIME2024, GPQA-Diamond); geometric analysis shows directional biases in embedding space leading to consistent fix and break attractors.

Conclusion: Similarity-based memory improves self-improving LLM reasoning in structured domains but exposes failure modes in heterogeneous ones, highlighting both benefits and limitations.

Abstract: Iterative summarization based reasoning frameworks such as InftyThink enable long-horizon reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by controlling context growth, but they repeatedly regenerate similar reasoning strategies across tasks. We introduce InftyThink with Cross-Chain Memory, an extension that augments iterative reasoning with an embedding-based semantic cache of previously successful reasoning patterns. At each reasoning step, the model retrieves and conditions on the most semantically similar stored lemmas, guiding inference without expanding the context window indiscriminately. Experiments on MATH500, AIME2024, and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that semantic lemma retrieval improves accuracy in structured domains while exposing failure modes in tests that include heterogeneous domains. Geometric analyses of reasoning trajectories reveal that cache retrieval induces directional biases in embedding space, leading to consistent fix (improve baseline accuracy) and break (degradation in baseline accuracy) attractors. Our results highlight both the benefits and limits of similarity-based memory for self-improving LLM reasoning.

### [71] [Scalable and Reliable Evaluation of AI Knowledge Retrieval Systems: RIKER and the Coherent Simulated Universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08847)
*JV Roig*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RIKER (Retrieval Intelligence and Knowledge Extraction Rating) is a novel benchmark and methodology that uses paradigm inversion to generate documents from known ground truth, enabling deterministic, scalable, and contamination-resistant evaluation of knowledge systems without human annotation or reference models. It reveals that many LLMs overclaim context length capacity, cross-document aggregation is significantly harder than single-document tasks, and grounding ability is distinct from hallucination resistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for knowledge systems suffer from contamination in static benchmarks, biases in LLM-based judges, and high costs of human annotation. There is a need for scalable, reliable, and reproducible evaluation frameworks.

Method: RIKER employs paradigm inversion: instead of extracting ground truth from documents, it generates synthetic documents from structured ground truth. This allows deterministic scoring, avoids contamination via regenerable corpora, and enables large-scale evaluation without human input.

Result: Evaluation of 33 models using over 21 billion tokens shows that usable context length is often below claimed limits (especially beyond 32K tokens), cross-document aggregation is substantially more difficult than single-document extraction, and grounding ability does not imply resistance to hallucination.

Conclusion: RIKER provides a domain-agnostic, scalable, and contamination-resistant evaluation framework for knowledge systems. Its methodology can be applied wherever structured ground truth can be used to generate synthetic data, offering a robust alternative to traditional evaluation approaches.

Abstract: Evaluating knowledge systems (LLMs, RAG, knowledge graphs, etc) faces fundamental challenges: static benchmarks are vulnerable to contamination, LLM-based judges exhibit systematic biases, and ground truth extraction requires expensive human annotation. We present RIKER (Retrieval Intelligence and Knowledge Extraction Rating), both a benchmark and a replicable methodology based on paradigm inversion - generating documents from known ground truth rather than extracting ground truth from documents. This approach enables deterministic scoring and scalable evaluation without human annotation or reference models, and contamination resistance through regenerable corpora. Our evaluation of 33 models using over 21 billion tokens reveals that context length claims frequently exceed usable capacity, with significant degradation beyond 32K tokens; cross-document aggregation proves substantially harder than single-document extraction; and grounding ability and hallucination resistance are distinct capabilities - models excelling at finding facts that exist may still fabricate facts that do not. Beyond the specific benchmark, we contribute a domain-agnostic methodology for constructing scalable and contamination-resistant evaluations wherever synthetic documents can be generated from structured ground truth.

Abstract: This paper presents PediaMind-R1, a domain-specialized large language model designed to achieve active personalization in intelligent parenting scenarios. Unlike conventional systems that provide generic suggestions, PediaMind-R1 draws on insights from developmental psychology. It introduces temperament theory from the Thomas-Chess framework and builds a temperament knowledge graph for infants and toddlers (0-3 years). Our two-stage training pipeline first uses supervised fine-tuning to teach structured chain-of-thought reasoning, and then applies a GRPO-based alignment stage to reinforce logical consistency, domain expertise, and empathetic caregiving strategies. We further design an evaluation framework comprising temperament-sensitive multiple-choice tests and human assessments. The results demonstrate that PediaMind-R1 can accurately interpret early childhood temperament profiles and proactively engage in individualized reasoning. This work highlights the value of integrating vertical-domain modeling with psychological theory. It offers a novel approach to developing user-centered LLMs that advance the practice of active personalization in sensitive caregiving contexts.

*Manas Khatore,Sumana Sridharan,Kevork Sulahian,Benjamin J. Smith,Shi Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了自动化答案匹配模型在面对策略性攻击（如冗长回答、多重答案、矛盾答案嵌入等）时的鲁棒性。结果表明，这些操纵手段不仅未能提高得分，反而常导致得分下降；且二元评分（正确/错误）比连续评分（部分正确）更抗攻击。结论是：当存在参考答案时，答案匹配技术对简单文本操纵具有较强鲁棒性，可作为LLM或人工评价的可行替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化答案匹配利用大语言模型评估自由文本回答，具有可扩展性和对齐性优势，但其可靠性可能受策略性攻击影响，如通过冗长、多答案或嵌入矛盾信息等方式虚假提升分数。因此需评估其对抗此类攻击的能力。

Method: 通过设计三种典型攻击策略（生成冗长回答、提供多个答案、在开头嵌入正确答案并混入矛盾内容），对答案匹配模型进行测试，并比较二元评分与连续评分在攻击下的表现差异。

Result: 所有测试的操纵策略均未提升得分，多数情况下降低得分；二元评分机制显著优于连续评分，在抵御攻击方面更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 答案匹配模型对低成本文本操纵具有较强的鲁棒性，是一种可靠且可扩展的评价方式，尤其在有参考答案的情况下，可作为传统LLM或人工评价的有效替代。

Abstract: Automated answer matching, which leverages LLMs to evaluate free-text responses by comparing them to a reference answer, shows substantial promise as a scalable and aligned alternative to human evaluation. However, its reliability requires robustness against strategic attacks such as guesswork or verbosity that may artificially inflate scores without improving actual correctness. In this work, we systematically investigate whether such tactics deceive answer matching models by prompting examinee models to: (1) generate verbose responses, (2) provide multiple answers when unconfident, and (3) embed conflicting answers with the correct answer near the start of their response. Our results show that these manipulations do not increase scores and often reduce them. Additionally, binary scoring (which requires a matcher to answer with a definitive "correct" or "incorrect") is more robust to attacks than continuous scoring (which requires a matcher to determine partial correctness). These findings show that answer matching is generally robust to inexpensive text manipulation and is a viable alternative to traditional LLM-as-a-judge or human evaluation when reference answers are available.

*Alex Dantart*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Recent 'Contextualized Chunking' techniques inject summaries to improve RAG context but introduce 'vector dilution' that obscures local content. An inverted U-shaped performance curve is observed: moderate injection increases Recall by 18%, but exceeding a critical threshold (CIR > 0.4) reduces precision by 22% for specific queries. A theoretical framework is proposed to determine the optimal injection ratio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between improved contextual awareness and degraded precision caused by vector dilution in RAG systems using summary injection in Contextualized Chunking.

Method: Empirical evaluation of varying summary injection ratios, analysis of recall and precision across different query types, and development of a theoretical model to compute the optimal injection ratio.

Result: Moderate injection improves Recall by 18%, but excessive injection (CIR > 0.4) causes a 22% drop in precision for specific queries; a theoretical framework enables identification of the optimal injection ratio.

Conclusion: Optimal performance in RAG systems using Contextualized Chunking requires balancing summary injection to avoid vector dilution, with the proposed framework enabling precise tuning of injection ratios for maximum effectiveness.

Abstract: Técnicas recientes de "Contextualized Chunking" inyectan resúmenes para mejorar el contexto en RAG, pero introducen una "dilución vectorial" que opaca el contenido local.

Proponemos un marco teórico para calcular el ratio óptimo de inyección. --

Abstract: Automated news verification requires structured claim extraction, but existing approaches either lack schema compliance or generalize poorly across domains. This paper presents NewsScope, a cross-domain dataset, benchmark, and fine-tuned model for schema-grounded news claim extraction. The dataset contains 455 articles across politics, health, science/environment, and business, consisting of 395 in-domain articles and 60 out-of-source articles for generalization testing. LLaMA 3.1 8B was fine-tuned using LoRA on 315 training examples and evaluated on held-out in-domain (80 articles) and out-of-source (60 articles) test sets. Human evaluation on 400 claims shows NewsScope achieves 89.4% human-evaluated accuracy compared to GPT-4o-mini's 93.7% (p=0.07). NewsScope outperforms GPT-4o-mini on political claims (94.3% vs. 87.8%). A numeric grounding filter further improves accuracy to 91.6%, narrowing the gap to 2.1 percentage points. Inter-annotator agreement studies (160 claims) confirm labeling reliability (94.6% positive agreement on SUPPORTED judgments).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有世界模型方法多局限于单步或固定时域的模拟，难以充分支持复杂任务规划，亟需更灵活的前瞻性推理机制。

Method: 引入自适应前瞻机制，在目标达成与任务进展之间权衡，结合世界模型生成多步想象轨迹，并将其与当前观测融合，构建可想象的马尔可夫决策过程以指导策略学习。

Result: 在多个代表性基准测试中，ITP显著优于现有基线方法；分析表明其自适应前瞻机制有效提升了智能体的推理能力。

Conclusion: ITP框架通过多步想象与自适应前瞻，显著增强了智能体在复杂任务中的规划与决策能力，为未来自主智能系统的设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in world models have shown promise for modeling future dynamics of environmental states, enabling agents to reason and act without accessing real environments. Current methods mainly perform single-step or fixed-horizon rollouts, leaving their potential for complex task planning under-exploited. We propose Imagine-then-Plan (\texttt{ITP}), a unified framework for agent learning via lookahead imagination, where an agent's policy model interacts with the learned world model, yielding multi-step ``imagined'' trajectories. Since the imagination horizon may vary by tasks and stages, we introduce a novel adaptive lookahead mechanism by trading off the ultimate goal and task progress. The resulting imagined trajectories provide rich signals about future consequences, such as achieved progress and potential conflicts, which are fused with current observations, formulating a partially \textit{observable} and \textit{imaginable} Markov decision process to guide policy learning. We instantiate \texttt{ITP} with both training-free and reinforcement-trained variants. Extensive experiments across representative agent benchmarks demonstrate that \texttt{ITP} significantly outperforms competitive baselines. Further analyses validate that our adaptive lookahead largely enhances agents' reasoning capability, providing valuable insights into addressing broader, complex tasks.

*Pedro Memoli Buffa,Luciano Del Corro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了在部署大语言模型（LLM）时面临的两大挑战：监控（监测模型在数据分布漂移下的性能下降）和改进（优先获取数据以弥补最大的性能差距）。作者提出利用推理时的输出熵特征来估计在领域漂移下的切片级准确率。通过对每个响应的最终层下一个词概率（来自top-k logprobs）计算输出熵轮廓，并总结为11个统计量，再通过轻量级分类器预测实例正确性，进而平均预测概率得到领域级别的准确率估计。在10个STEM推理基准测试上进行评估，涵盖多种训练/测试组合（k=1,2,3,4；所有“10选k”组合），涉及6个模型家族的9个模型（3B-20B参数规模）。结果表明，该方法的估计值通常能有效跟踪真实基准准确率，部分模型甚至呈现近似单调的领域排序。因此，输出熵轮廓是一种可扩展、易获取的信号，可用于高效监控与数据采集的精准靶向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在部署大语言模型时，面临监控性能下降和指导数据改进的双重挑战。传统方法难以在动态环境中持续评估模型表现，尤其在数据分布漂移时缺乏有效的实时反馈机制。因此需要一种低成本、高可扩展性的推理时信号，用于估计不同数据子集的准确性，从而支持持续监控和有针对性的数据增强。

Method: 针对每个生成响应，从最终层的下一个词概率中提取top-k logprobs，构建输出熵轮廓，并归纳为11个统计特征。使用一个轻量级分类器对每个实例的正确性进行预测，通过平均预测概率得到整体领域的准确率估计。

Result: 在多个STEM推理任务上，输出熵轮廓所生成的估计值与真实基准准确率高度相关，部分模型表现出近乎单调的领域排序，说明该方法能有效反映模型在不同数据分布下的性能变化。

Conclusion: 输出熵轮廓是一种简单、高效且可扩展的推理时信号，能够有效用于大语言模型在领域漂移下的性能监控，同时指导数据采集策略的优化，提升模型持续学习和适应能力。

Abstract: Deploying LLMs raises two coupled challenges: (1) monitoring - estimating where a model underperforms as traffic and domains drift - and (2) improvement - prioritizing data acquisition to close the largest performance gaps. We test whether an inference-time signal can estimate slice-level accuracy under domain shift. For each response, we compute an output-entropy profile from final-layer next-token probabilities (from top-k logprobs) and summarize it with eleven statistics. A lightweight classifier predicts instance correctness, and averaging predicted probabilities yields a domain-level accuracy estimate. We evaluate on ten STEM reasoning benchmarks with exhaustive train/test compositions (k in {1,2,3,4}; all "10 choose k" combinations), across nine LLMs from six families (3B-20B). Estimates often track held-out benchmark accuracy, and several models show near-monotonic ordering of domains. Output-entropy profiles are thus an accessible signal for scalable monitoring and for targeting data acquisition.

Method: 采用两阶段微调：第一阶段使用高质量合成平行数据和人工翻译数据进行监督微调；第二阶段通过集成奖励模型（如 MetricX-QE、AutoMQM）进行强化学习优化翻译质量。

Result: 在 WMT25 和 WMT24++ 基准上，自动与人工评估均显示 TranslateGemma 显著优于基线模型；小模型性能可媲美大模型，且在图像翻译任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: TranslateGemma 为研究社区提供了强大、高效且可扩展的开源机器翻译工具，兼具优异翻译性能与多模态能力。

Abstract: We present TranslateGemma, a suite of open machine translation models based on the Gemma 3 foundation models. To enhance the inherent multilingual capabilities of Gemma 3 for the translation task, we employ a two-stage fine-tuning process. First, supervised fine-tuning is performed using a rich mixture of high-quality large-scale synthetic parallel data generated via state-of-the-art models and human-translated parallel data. This is followed by a reinforcement learning phase, where we optimize translation quality using an ensemble of reward models, including MetricX-QE and AutoMQM, targeting translation quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TranslateGemma with human evaluation on the WMT25 test set across 10 language pairs and with automatic evaluation on the WMT24++ benchmark across 55 language pairs. Automatic metrics show consistent and substantial gains over the baseline Gemma 3 models across all sizes. Notably, smaller TranslateGemma models often achieve performance comparable to larger baseline models, offering improved efficiency. We also show that TranslateGemma models retain strong multimodal capabilities, with enhanced performance on the Vistra image translation benchmark. The release of the open TranslateGemma models aims to provide the research community with powerful and adaptable tools for machine translation.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于社交推理游戏Spyfall的动态基准测试框架，用于评估大语言模型在多语言和跨文化场景下的能力。通过模拟角色推理与策略对话，模型需识别或隐藏身份，涉及文化相关地点或食物。实验表明该方法与Chatbot Arena排名高度一致，但非英语情境下模型表现显著下降，尤其在本地化实体理解、规则遵守和策略一致性方面存在明显短板。该方法具有可扩展性、抗数据泄露和文化敏感性优势，是传统NLP基准的有力替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态基准已出现数据饱和与泄露问题，亟需更动态、鲁棒且能反映真实跨文化交互能力的评估方法。

Method: 设计基于社交推理游戏Spyfall的动态评估框架，要求模型在多语言环境下进行策略性对话以识别秘密角色或隐藏身份，利用文化特异性内容（如地点、食物）增强情境真实性。

Result: 游戏评分与Chatbot Arena高度一致；但在非英语语境中，模型在本地化实体理解、规则遵循和战略连贯性上表现较差，凸显其跨文化能力局限。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于游戏的评估框架提供了可扩展、抗数据泄露且文化敏感的替代方案，有助于更真实地衡量大语言模型在多语言多文化环境中的综合能力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has necessitated more robust evaluation methods that go beyond static benchmarks, which are increasingly prone to data saturation and leakage. In this paper, we propose a dynamic benchmarking framework for evaluating multilingual and multicultural capabilities through the social deduction game Spyfall. In our setup, models must engage in strategic dialogue to either identify a secret agent or avoid detection, utilizing culturally relevant locations or local foods. Our results show that our game-based rankings align closely with the Chatbot Arena. However, we find a significant performance gap in non-English contexts: models are generally less proficient when handling locally specific entities and often struggle with rule-following or strategic integrity in non-English languages. We demonstrate that this game-based approach provides a scalable, leakage-resistant, and culturally nuanced alternative to traditional NLP benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG模型假设检索信息与问题高度相关，但实际中检索内容的相关性和有用性存在差异，影响生成质量；因此需要更有效地评估和利用检索信息的质量，以提高生成结果的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出OpenDecoder，引入三种显式评估指标（相关性得分、排序得分、QPP得分）作为生成过程中的质量指示特征，增强模型对噪声上下文的适应能力。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的实验结果显示，OpenDecoder在性能和鲁棒性方面均优于多种基线方法，且可灵活集成到LLM后训练或其他外部指标中。

Conclusion: OpenDecoder通过显式评估检索信息质量，显著提升了RAG模型在不同噪声水平下的表现，是一种高效、灵活且可推广的改进范式。

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has achieved superior performance in a range of downstream tasks, including LLM-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The quality of generated content heavily relies on the usefulness of the retrieved information and the capacity of LLMs' internal information processing mechanism to incorporate it in answer generation. It is generally assumed that the retrieved information is relevant to the question. However, the retrieved information may have a variable degree of relevance and usefulness, depending on the question and the document collection. It is important to take into account the relevance of the retrieved information in answer generation. In this paper, we propose OpenDecoder, a new approach that leverages explicit evaluation of the retrieved information as quality indicator features for generation. We aim to build a RAG model that is more robust to varying levels of noisy context. Three types of explicit evaluation information are considered: relevance score, ranking score, and QPP (query performance prediction) score. The experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and better robustness of OpenDecoder by outperforming various baseline methods. Importantly, this paradigm is flexible to be integrated with the post-training of LLMs for any purposes and incorporated with any type of external indicators.

Motivation: 当前科学推理需要将结构化实验数据与非结构化文献解释相联系，但大多数大语言模型无法跨模态联合推理。因此，亟需一种能够整合结构化数据与文献知识的新型查询系统，以提升科学发现效率与可解释性。

Method: 提出 SpectraQuery 框架，基于 SUQL 设计思想，结合语义解析与检索增强生成技术，将自然语言问题映射为协同执行的 SQL 查询与文献检索任务，实现数据与文献的联合推理，并生成带引用的可信答案。

Conclusion: 混合检索架构可通过有效融合结构化数据与非结构化文献，显著提升科学工作流的智能化水平，尤其适用于处理大规模实验数据的跨模态推理任务。

Abstract: Scientific reasoning increasingly requires linking structured experimental data with the unstructured literature that explains it, yet most large language model (LLM) assistants cannot reason jointly across these modalities. We introduce SpectraQuery, a hybrid natural-language query framework that integrates a relational Raman spectroscopy database with a vector-indexed scientific literature corpus using a Structured and Unstructured Query Language (SUQL)-inspired design. By combining semantic parsing with retrieval-augmented generation, SpectraQuery translates open-ended questions into coordinated SQL and literature retrieval operations, producing cited answers that unify numerical evidence with mechanistic explanation. Across SQL correctness, answer groundedness, retrieval effectiveness, and expert evaluation, SpectraQuery demonstrates strong performance: approximately 80 percent of generated SQL queries are fully correct, synthesized answers reach 93-97 percent groundedness with 10-15 retrieved passages, and battery scientists rate responses highly across accuracy, relevance, grounding, and clarity (4.1-4.6/5). These results show that hybrid retrieval architectures can meaningfully support scientific workflows by bridging data and discourse for high-volume experimental datasets.

Method: 招募人类参与者，并使用四种不同规模的指令微调大语言模型对 240 个对话句进行评分，每个句子配以 40 个解释性问题，采用 10 分制李克特量表进行评估，比较人类与模型在表面与深层语义层面的判断一致性。

Result: 人类与大语言模型在表层判断上一致，但在深层语义理解上存在显著分歧，尤其是在处理习语、讽刺、俚语和情感表达等社会语用性语言时。GPT-4 在代表层面最接近人类，但所有模型均表现出对上下文依赖和社交语用表达的理解困难。

Conclusion: 尽管大语言模型在模仿人类语言判断方面取得进展，但在理解复杂的社会语用和隐喻性语言方面仍存在明显局限，尤其是对文化特定表达如 Gen Z 俚语和习语的理解能力不足。

Abstract: Large language models generate judgments that resemble those of humans. Yet the extent to which these models align with human judgments in interpreting figurative and socially grounded language remains uncertain. To investigate this, human participants and four instruction-tuned LLMs of different sizes (GPT-4, Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.2, and Mistral-7B) rated 240 dialogue-based sentences representing six linguistic traits: conventionality, sarcasm, funny, emotional, idiomacy, and slang. Each of the 240 sentences was paired with 40 interpretive questions, and both humans and LLMs rated these sentences on a 10-point Likert scale. Results indicated that humans and LLMs aligned at the surface level with humans, but diverged significantly at the representational level, especially in interpreting figurative sentences involving idioms and Gen Z slang. GPT-4 most closely approximates human representational patterns, while all models struggle with context-dependent and socio-pragmatic expressions like sarcasm, slang, and idiomacy.

### [84] [Is Grokking Worthwhile? Functional Analysis and Transferability of Generalization Circuits in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09049)
*Kaiyu He,Zhang Mian,Peilin Wu,Xinya Du,Zhiyu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大型语言模型在经历长时间训练（即'grokking'阶段）后形成的'泛化电路'是否真正提升了模型在组合任务中的表现。研究发现，已'grokked'和未'grokked'模型在分布内组合查询上的推理路径相同，表明'泛化电路'并非突然获得的新推理范式，而是将记忆的原子事实整合到已有推理路径中的过程。此外，高准确率与特定推理路径的形成可独立出现，且成熟电路在引入新知识时仍表现出有限迁移能力，说明'grokked' Transformer并未完全掌握组合逻辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型在长时间训练后形成的'泛化电路'是否真正提升了其在组合任务中的性能，以及这种计算成本高昂的训练是否值得。

Method: 通过机制分析，比较'grokked'与非'grokked'模型在分布内组合查询上的推理路径，并考察在不同数据设置下准确率与推理路径形成之间的关系，评估成熟电路的知识迁移能力。

Result: 1. 已'grokked'与非'grokked'模型在分布内任务上的推理路径一致；2. 高准确率与推理路径形成可独立发生；3. 成熟的'泛化电路'在整合新知识时迁移能力有限。

Conclusion: Grokked模型并未实现对组合逻辑的全面掌握，其'泛化电路'本质是将记忆事实融入已有推理路径的过程，而非生成全新推理模式；因此，等待长期grokking训练的收益有限，尤其在知识迁移方面。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at factual retrieval, they often struggle with the "curse of two-hop reasoning" in compositional tasks. Recent research suggests that parameter-sharing transformers can bridge this gap by forming a "Generalization Circuit" during a prolonged "grokking" phase. A fundamental question arises: Is a grokked model superior to its non-grokked counterparts on downstream tasks? Furthermore, is the extensive computational cost of waiting for the grokking phase worthwhile? In this work, we conduct a mechanistic study to evaluate the Generalization Circuit's role in knowledge assimilation and transfer. We demonstrate that: (i) The inference paths established by non-grokked and grokked models for in-distribution compositional queries are identical. This suggests that the "Generalization Circuit" does not represent the sudden acquisition of a new reasoning paradigm. Instead, we argue that grokking is the process of integrating memorized atomic facts into an naturally established reasoning path. (ii) Achieving high accuracy on unseen cases after prolonged training and the formation of a certain reasoning path are not bound; they can occur independently under specific data regimes. (iii) Even a mature circuit exhibits limited transferability when integrating new knowledge, suggesting that "grokked" Transformers do not achieve a full mastery of compositional logic.

*Tianyi Xu,Xuan Ouyang,Binwei Yao,Shoua Xiong,Sara Misurelli,Maichou Lor,Junjie Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SITA是一种轻量级适配方案，旨在提升预训练wav2vec类编码器在声调低资源语言（如苗语）上的表现，通过联合优化说话人不变性和声调感知性，在跨性别语音检索和语音识别任务中均取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 声调低资源语言虽广泛使用，但现代语音技术对其覆盖不足，主要挑战在于如何学习对性别等干扰因素鲁棒且保持声调敏感的表示。

Method: 采用分阶段多目标训练：(i) 跨性别对比损失促进词义一致性，声调排斥损失防止相同词不同声调实例的混淆；(ii) 引入基于CTC的辅助语音识别目标并结合知识蒸馏以稳定识别相关结构。

Result: 在苗语数据集上，SITA显著提升了跨性别词汇检索准确率，同时保持了与ASR优化的XLS-R教师模型相当的语音识别性能，并在普通话上也观察到类似提升，表明该方法具有通用性和可移植性。

Conclusion: SITA是一种通用、即插即用的轻量级适配方法，能有效提升多语言语音编码器在声调语言中的表现，尤其适用于资源匮乏的声调语言。

Abstract: Tonal low-resource languages are widely spoken yet remain underserved by modern speech technology. A key challenge is learning representations that are robust to nuisance variation such as gender while remaining tone-aware for different lexical meanings. To address this, we propose SITA, a lightweight adaptation recipe that enforces Speaker-Invariance and Tone-Awareness for pretrained wav2vec-style encoders. SITA uses staged multi-objective training: (i) a cross-gender contrastive objective encourages lexical consistency across speakers, while a tone-repulsive loss prevents tone collapse by explicitly separating same-word different-tone realizations; and (ii) an auxiliary Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based ASR objective with distillation stabilizes recognition-relevant structure. We evaluate primarily on Hmong, a highly tonal and severely under-resourced language where off-the-shelf multilingual encoders fail to represent tone effectively. On a curated Hmong word corpus, SITA improves cross-gender lexical retrieval accuracy, while maintaining usable ASR accuracy relative to an ASR-adapted XLS-R teacher. We further observe similar gains when transferring the same recipe to Mandarin, suggesting SITA is a general, plug-in approach for adapting multilingual speech encoders to tonal languages.

Motivation: 解决低资源语言在对话摘要和问答任务中的性能瓶颈，避免对每种语言进行复杂的任务特定微调，提升多语言系统的泛化能力与效率。

Method: 采用三阶段流水线：前向翻译（从印地语系语言到英语）、基于2.55B参数蒸馏语言模型的多任务文本生成、反向翻译回源语言；利用知识蒸馏技术压缩模型规模并保持高性能。

Result: 在九种语言上均取得强表现，特别是在马拉地语（86.7% QnA）、泰米尔语（86.7% QnA）和印地语（80.0% QnA）上表现突出，系统在竞赛中多个任务中赢得高胜率。

Conclusion: 通过翻译引导的多语言处理框架结合知识蒸馏，可在不依赖任务特定微调的情况下实现对低资源语言的高效、高精度对话理解与生成，验证了该方法在跨语言自然语言处理中的有效性与可扩展性。

Abstract: This paper presents team Kl33n3x's multilingual dialogue summarization and question answering system developed for the NLPAI4Health 2025 shared task. The approach employs a three-stage pipeline: forward translation from Indic languages to English, multitask text generation using a 2.55B parameter distilled language model, and reverse translation back to source languages. By leveraging knowledge distillation techniques, this work demonstrates that compact models can achieve highly competitive performance across nine languages. The system achieved strong win rates across the competition's tasks, with particularly robust performance on Marathi (86.7% QnA), Tamil (86.7% QnA), and Hindi (80.0% QnA), demonstrating the effectiveness of translation-based approaches for low-resource language processing without task-specific fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 本文综述了自然语言处理中注释者分歧的建模方法，提出一个跨领域的分歧来源分类体系，并基于预测目标和聚合结构的统一框架，分析了从共识学习到显式建模分歧、再到捕捉注释者间结构关系的演变。文章还回顾了评估指标，指出多数公平性评估仍停留在描述性层面。最后指出了未来研究方向，包括整合多种变化源、开发分歧感知的可解释性框架，以及应对视角主义建模的实际权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 注释者分歧在主观和模糊任务中普遍存在，如毒性检测和立场分析。传统方法将分歧视为噪声，但近年研究认为其反映了理解与视角的多样性，因此需要更深入的建模。

Method: 提出一个领域无关的分歧来源分类体系（数据、任务、注释者因素），并采用统一框架（预测目标与聚合结构）对建模方法进行系统梳理，涵盖共识学习、分歧建模及注释者关系建模。

Result: 揭示了分歧建模从去除噪声到利用分歧信号的范式转变；强调了结构化注释者关系的重要性；指出当前公平性评估多为描述性而非规范性；总结出若干开放挑战与未来方向。

Conclusion: 未来研究需整合多重变异源，发展分歧感知的可解释框架，并正视视角主义建模中的实际权衡，推动更全面的分歧认知与应用。

Abstract: Annotator disagreement is widespread in NLP, particularly for subjective and ambiguous tasks such as toxicity detection and stance analysis. While early approaches treated disagreement as noise to be removed, recent work increasingly models it as a meaningful signal reflecting variation in interpretation and perspective. This survey provides a unified view of disagreement-aware NLP methods. We first present a domain-agnostic taxonomy of the sources of disagreement spanning data, task, and annotator factors. We then synthesize modeling approaches using a common framework defined by prediction targets and pooling structure, highlighting a shift from consensus learning toward explicitly modeling disagreement, and toward capturing structured relationships among annotators. We review evaluation metrics for both predictive performance and annotator behavior, and noting that most fairness evaluations remain descriptive rather than normative. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future directions, including integrating multiple sources of variation, developing disagreement-aware interpretability frameworks, and grappling with the practical tradeoffs of perspectivist modeling.

Abstract: We introduce Mi:dm 2.0, a bilingual large language model (LLM) specifically engineered to advance Korea-centric AI. This model goes beyond Korean text processing by integrating the values, reasoning patterns, and commonsense knowledge inherent to Korean society, enabling nuanced understanding of cultural contexts, emotional subtleties, and real-world scenarios to generate reliable and culturally appropriate responses. To address limitations of existing LLMs, often caused by insufficient or low-quality Korean data and lack of cultural alignment, Mi:dm 2.0 emphasizes robust data quality through a comprehensive pipeline that includes proprietary data cleansing, high-quality synthetic data generation, strategic data mixing with curriculum learning, and a custom Korean-optimized tokenizer to improve efficiency and coverage. To realize this vision, we offer two complementary configurations: Mi:dm 2.0 Base (11.5B parameters), built with a depth-up scaling strategy for general-purpose use, and Mi:dm 2.0 Mini (2.3B parameters), optimized for resource-constrained environments and specialized tasks. Mi:dm 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on Korean-specific benchmarks, with top-tier zero-shot results on KMMLU and strong internal evaluation results across language, humanities, and social science tasks. The Mi:dm 2.0 lineup is released under the MIT license to support extensive research and commercial use. By offering accessible and high-performance Korea-centric LLMs, KT aims to accelerate AI adoption across Korean industries, public services, and education, strengthen the Korean AI developer community, and lay the groundwork for the broader vision of K-intelligence.

### [89] [From Symbolic to Natural-Language Relations: Rethinking Knowledge Graph Construction in the Era of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09069)
*Kanyao Han,Yushang Lai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了知识图谱（KG）中关系表示的范式转变，指出传统基于符号化关系标签的设计在处理现实世界中上下文丰富、模糊且不确定的关系时存在局限。随着大语言模型（LLM）的发展，自然语言成为知识生成与推理的主要形式，因此应从符号关系转向自然语言关系描述。文章提出一种混合设计原则，在保留基本结构骨架的同时，增强关系表达的灵活性和上下文敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识图谱使用离散的符号关系标签，无法充分表达真实世界中复杂、多变且不确定的关系语义；而当前大语言模型的发展使得自然语言成为知识表达和推理的主流方式，促使我们重新思考关系表示的形式。

Method: 提出从符号关系向自然语言关系描述过渡的混合设计原则，保留必要的结构基础，同时支持更灵活、上下文敏感的关系建模。

Result: 通过引入自然语言关系描述，能够更准确地捕捉现实世界中的细微语义差异，提升知识图谱在复杂场景下的表达能力与实用性。

Conclusion: 知识图谱的关系表示应顺应大语言模型时代的趋势，由静态符号化转向动态自然语言化，采用混合设计以兼顾结构化与灵活性。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have commonly been constructed using predefined symbolic relation schemas, typically implemented as categorical relation labels. This design has notable shortcomings: real-world relations are often contextual, nuanced, and sometimes uncertain, and compressing it into discrete relation labels abstracts away critical semantic detail. Nevertheless, symbolic-relation KGs remain widely used because they have been operationally effective and broadly compatible with pre-LLM downstream models and algorithms, in which KG knowledge could be retrieved or encoded into quantified features and embeddings at scale. The emergence of LLMs has reshaped how knowledge is created and consumed. LLMs support scalable synthesis of domain facts directly in concise natural language, and prompting-based inference favors context-rich free-form text over quantified representations. This position paper argues that these changes call for rethinking the representation of relations themselves rather than merely using LLMs to populate conventional schemas more efficiently. We therefore advocate moving from symbolic to natural-language relation descriptions, and we propose hybrid design principles that preserve a minimal structural backbone while enabling more flexible and context-sensitive relational representations.

### [90] [How Many Human Judgments Are Enough? Feasibility Limits of Human Preference Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09084)
*Wilson Y. Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，当人类偏好信号在不同提示中分散时（即所有提示类型都具有相似信息量），比例分配是最优的，无法通过其他分配策略显著提升检测小改进的能力。大规模人类偏好数据集的实证分析表明，大多数比较处于这种分散状态，偏好差异小，需要远超常规收集数量的判断才能可靠检测改进。这一限制在不同评估协议和模态（如对话、图像生成、代码生成）中均存在。相比之下，经过优化的基准测试能减少提示引起的变异，系统性地增大偏好差距，使检测能力提升1.5倍。因此，许多看似“不显著”或“负面”的评估结果往往源于评估力度不足，而非模型等效，强调必须明确考虑效应大小、预算和评估设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人类偏好评估中所需判断数量，以可靠检测生成模型的小幅改进；澄清为何许多评估结果为负面或不显著，是否因模型实际无差异还是评估设计不足。

Method: 通过理论分析与大规模人类偏好数据集的实证研究，比较不同提示分布下的偏好信号扩散情况，评估不同分配策略的最优性，并对比标准与优化基准测试在减少提示变异、提升检测力方面的表现。

Result: 在提示信号分散的普遍情况下，多数比较需要远超当前实践的判断数量；优化的基准测试可降低提示级方差1.5倍，显著提升检测敏感度；多数否定性评估结果反映的是统计功效不足，而非模型等效。

Conclusion: 人类偏好评估的可靠性高度依赖于评估设计，包括样本量、提示多样性控制及效应大小考量。当前许多评估结果不可靠，应重新审视评估协议，增加判断数量或优化提示设计以提升检测能力。

Abstract: Human preference evaluations are widely used to compare generative models, yet it remains unclear how many judgments are required to reliably detect small improvements. We show that when preference signal is diffuse across prompts (i.e., all prompt types are similarly informative), proportional allocation is minimax-optimal: no allocation strategy substantially improves detectability. Empirical analysis of large-scale human preference datasets shows that most comparisons fall into this diffuse regime, exhibiting small preference margins that require far more judgments than typically collected, even in well-sampled comparisons. These limits persist across evaluation protocols and modalities, including chat, image generation, and code generation with execution feedback. In contrast, curated benchmarks that reduce prompt induced variability systematically induce larger margins and improve detectability through a $1.5\times$ reduction in prompt-level variance. Our results show that inconclusive or negative human evaluation outcomes frequently reflect underpowered evaluation rather than model equivalence, underscoring the need to account explicitly for effect size, budget, and protocol design.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出SubTokenTest基准，评估大语言模型在子令牌理解方面的能力，涵盖十个跨四个领域的实用任务，旨在揭示模型在字符级处理上的弱点，并分析测试时缩放对子令牌推理的影响及隐藏状态中的字符信息编码方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在推理能力上取得进展，但在基本的字符级任务（如单词中字母计数）上仍表现不佳，这源于其分词过程。现有基准虽揭示了这一问题，但常被认为缺乏实际意义。然而，许多真实应用场景（如文本地图导航、结构化表格解读）依赖于精确的子令牌理解，因此亟需一个更具实用性的评估基准。

Method: 提出SubTokenTest基准，包含十项任务，覆盖四个领域，通过解耦性能与复杂推理，专门评估子令牌理解能力；对九个先进的大语言模型进行综合评估，并研究测试时缩放对子令牌推理的影响以及字符级信息在隐藏状态中的编码情况。

Result: 实验表明，当前主流大语言模型在子令牌理解任务上表现不佳，尤其在涉及精细字符处理的任务中存在显著缺陷。测试时缩放虽有一定改善作用，但无法根本解决该问题。此外，隐藏状态中字符级信息的编码并不充分，导致模型难以准确执行细粒度操作。

Conclusion: 子令牌理解是当前大语言模型的一个关键短板，需要更深入的研究与改进。SubTokenTest为评估和提升模型在字符级处理能力方面提供了重要工具，未来工作应聚焦于增强模型对细粒度文本结构的理解能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities. However, they continue to struggle with basic character-level tasks, such as counting letters in words, a problem rooted in their tokenization process. While existing benchmarks have highlighted this weakness through basic character operations, such failures are often dismissed due to lacking practical relevance. Yet, many real-world applications, such as navigating text-based maps or interpreting structured tables, rely heavily on precise sub-token understanding. In this regard, we introduce SubTokenTest, a comprehensive benchmark that assesses sub-token understanding through practical, utility-driven tasks. Our benchmark includes ten tasks across four domains and isolates tokenization-related failures by decoupling performance from complex reasoning. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of nine advanced LLMs. Additionally, we investigate the impact of test-time scaling on sub-token reasoning and explore how character-level information is encoded within the hidden states.

Abstract: Fine-grained labor market analysis increasingly relies on mapping unstructured job advertisements to standardized skill taxonomies such as ESCO. This mapping is naturally formulated as an Extreme Multi-Label Classification (XMLC) problem, but supervised solutions are constrained by the scarcity and cost of large-scale, taxonomy-aligned annotations--especially in non-English settings where job-ad language diverges substantially from formal skill definitions. We propose a zero-shot skill extraction framework that eliminates the need for manually labeled job-ad training data. The framework uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to synthesize training instances from ESCO definitions, and introduces hierarchically constrained multi-skill generation based on ESCO Level-2 categories to improve semantic coherence in multi-label contexts. On top of the synthetic corpus, we train a contrastive bi-encoder that aligns job-ad sentences with ESCO skill descriptions in a shared embedding space; the encoder augments a BERT backbone with BiLSTM and attention pooling to better model long, information-dense requirement statements. An upstream RoBERTa-based binary filter removes non-skill sentences to improve end-to-end precision. Experiments show that (i) hierarchy-conditioned generation improves both fluency and discriminability relative to unconstrained pairing, and (ii) the resulting multi-label model transfers effectively to real-world Chinese job advertisements, achieving strong zero-shot retrieval performance (F1@5 = 0.72) and outperforming TF--IDF and standard BERT baselines. Overall, the proposed pipeline provides a scalable, data-efficient pathway for automated skill coding in labor economics and workforce analytics.

Abstract: Current patent claim generation systems face three fundamental limitations: poor cross-jurisdictional generalization, inadequate semantic relationship modeling between claims and prior art, and unreliable quality assessment. We introduce a novel three-stage framework that addresses these challenges through relationship-aware similarity analysis, domain-adaptive claim generation, and unified quality assessment. Our approach employs multi-head attention with eight specialized heads for explicit relationship modeling, integrates curriculum learning with dynamic LoRA adapter selection across five patent domains, and implements cross-attention mechanisms between evaluation aspects for comprehensive quality assessment. Extensive experiments on USPTO HUPD dataset, EPO patent collections, and Patent-CE benchmark demonstrate substantial improvements: 7.6-point ROUGE-L gain over GPT-4o, 8.3\% BERTScore enhancement over Llama-3.1-8B, and 0.847 correlation with human experts compared to 0.623 for separate evaluation models. Our method maintains 89.4\% cross-jurisdictional performance retention versus 76.2\% for baselines, establishing a comprehensive solution for automated patent prosecution workflows.

Motivation: 大语言模型在不同用户社会人口属性下的输出存在差异，影响事实准确性、实用性与安全性，尤其在无关身份信息的客观问题上。现有工作多关注刻板印象或表征偏差，而本文聚焦于身份相关的核心响应质量退化问题。

Method: 提出一种轻量级、无需训练的身份鲁棒生成框架，通过选择性去除非关键身份信息，保留语义必要属性，以维持输出内容完整性。

Result: 在四个基准测试和18个社会人口学身份上，相比原始提示，身份依赖偏差平均减少77%；相比提示防御方法，减少45%。

Conclusion: 本研究填补了缓解用户身份线索对核心生成质量影响的关键空白，提出的方法有效提升大语言模型在不同用户群体中的公平性与一致性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) outputs often vary across user sociodemographic attributes, leading to disparities in factual accuracy, utility, and safety, even for objective questions where demographic information is irrelevant. Unlike prior work on stereotypical or representational bias, this paper studies identity-dependent degradation of core response quality. We show empirically that such degradation arises from biased generation behavior, despite factual knowledge being robustly encoded across identities. Motivated by this mismatch, we propose a lightweight, training-free framework for identity-robust generation that selectively neutralizes non-critical identity information while preserving semantically essential attributes, thus maintaining output content integrity. Experiments across four benchmarks and 18 sociodemographic identities demonstrate an average 77% reduction in identity-dependent bias compared to vanilla prompting and a 45% reduction relative to prompt-based defenses. Our work addresses a critical gap in mitigating the impact of user identity cues in prompts on core generation quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出OrthoGeoLoRA，一种改进的参数高效微调方法，通过在低秩因子上施加正交约束（Stiefel流形）来解决标准LoRA的几何缺陷（如规范自由、尺度模糊和秩坍缩），并采用几何重参数化以兼容现有优化器。作者还构建了基于欧洲语言社会科学术语表（ELSST）的层次概念检索基准。实验表明，在相同低秩预算下，OrthoGeoLoRA在多语言句子编码器上的排名性能优于标准LoRA及多种强基线方法，为资源受限场景下的基础模型适配提供了更高效、节能的路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LoRA存在几何缺陷，如规范自由、尺度模糊和秩坍缩，限制其在资源受限环境中的性能与稳定性。为提升参数高效微调在社会科学研究领域（如数字图书馆、数据目录）的应用可行性，需设计更具几何鲁棒性的方法。

Method: 提出OrthoGeoLoRA，通过将低秩更新形式重构为类似SVD的形式ΔW = BΣA^T，强制低秩因子满足正交性约束（位于Stiefel流形上），并采用几何重参数化实现与Adam等标准优化器及现有微调流程的兼容。

Result: 在多语言句子编码器上，OrthoGeoLoRA在层级概念检索任务中显著优于标准LoRA及多个强基线PEFT方法，尤其在低秩预算下表现更优，验证了其在计算与参数效率上的优势。

Conclusion: OrthoGeoLoRA通过几何约束提升了低秩微调的稳定性与性能，是一种适用于资源受限机构的高效、可扩展的模型适配方案，对推动开放科学与数字人文基础设施的发展具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models and text encoders increasingly power web-based information systems in the social sciences, including digital libraries, data catalogues, and search interfaces used by researchers, policymakers, and civil society. Full fine-tuning is often computationally and energy intensive, which can be prohibitive for smaller institutions and non-profit organizations in the Web4Good ecosystem. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces this cost by updating only a small number of parameters. We show that the standard LoRA update $ΔW = BA^\top$ has geometric drawbacks: gauge freedom, scale ambiguity, and a tendency toward rank collapse. We introduce OrthoGeoLoRA, which enforces an SVD-like form $ΔW = BΣA^\top$ by constraining the low-rank factors to be orthogonal (Stiefel manifold). A geometric reparameterization implements this constraint while remaining compatible with standard optimizers such as Adam and existing fine-tuning pipelines. We also propose a benchmark for hierarchical concept retrieval over the European Language Social Science Thesaurus (ELSST), widely used to organize social science resources in digital repositories. Experiments with a multilingual sentence encoder show that OrthoGeoLoRA outperforms standard LoRA and several strong PEFT variants on ranking metrics under the same low-rank budget, offering a more compute- and parameter-efficient path to adapt foundation models in resource-constrained settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProFit提出通过掩码低概率词来防止表面过拟合，利用高概率词捕捉核心逻辑框架，有效缓解单参考答案导致的过拟合问题，在推理和数学基准测试中优于传统SFT方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SFT忽略语言的一对多特性，强制模型对单一参考答案对齐，导致模型过拟合于非核心表达；尽管引入多参考答案可缓解此问题，但数据与计算成本过高，因此需优先解决单参考过拟合问题。

Method: 揭示了词元概率与语义重要性之间的内在联系：高概率词承载核心逻辑结构，低概率词多为可替换表达；基于此提出ProFit方法，通过选择性掩码低概率词以防止表面过拟合。

Result: 大量实验表明，ProFit在通用推理和数学基准测试中持续优于传统SFT基线。

Conclusion: ProFit通过聚焦核心语义信息，有效缓解了因单参考答案引起的过拟合问题，是一种高效且实用的SFT改进策略。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a fundamental post-training strategy to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent. However, traditional SFT often ignores the one-to-many nature of language by forcing alignment with a single reference answer, leading to the model overfitting to non-core expressions. Although our empirical analysis suggests that introducing multiple reference answers can mitigate this issue, the prohibitive data and computational costs necessitate a strategic shift: prioritizing the mitigation of single-reference overfitting over the costly pursuit of answer diversity. To achieve this, we reveal the intrinsic connection between token probability and semantic importance: high-probability tokens carry the core logical framework, while low-probability tokens are mostly replaceable expressions. Based on this insight, we propose ProFit, which selectively masks low-probability tokens to prevent surface-level overfitting. Extensive experiments confirm that ProFit consistently outperforms traditional SFT baselines on general reasoning and mathematical benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Ca2KG是一种因果感知校准框架，用于改进知识图谱增强生成（KG-RAG）模型的置信度校准问题。通过引入反事实提示和基于面板的重新评分机制，有效缓解了模型在知识不完整或不可靠时的过度自信问题，同时保持甚至提升预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KG-RAG模型在面对不完整或不可靠的知识子图时，表现出严重的过度自信，影响其在高风险场景中的可信度与可用性，亟需一种能够准确评估推理可靠性的校准方法。

Method: 提出Ca2KG框架，结合反事实提示以暴露知识质量与推理可靠性中的检索依赖性不确定性，并采用基于面板的重新评分机制稳定不同干预下的预测结果。

Result: 在两个复杂问答数据集上的实验表明，Ca2KG显著提升了模型的校准性能，同时维持或提升了预测准确性。

Conclusion: Ca2KG有效解决了KG-RAG模型的过度自信问题，增强了模型在复杂任务中的可解释性与可靠性，为高风险应用提供了更可信的推理支持。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) extends the RAG paradigm by incorporating structured knowledge from knowledge graphs, enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform more precise and explainable reasoning. While KG-RAG improves factual accuracy in complex tasks, existing KG-RAG models are often severely overconfident, producing high-confidence predictions even when retrieved sub-graphs are incomplete or unreliable, which raises concerns for deployment in high-stakes domains. To address this issue, we propose Ca2KG, a Causality-aware Calibration framework for KG-RAG. Ca2KG integrates counterfactual prompting, which exposes retrieval-dependent uncertainties in knowledge quality and reasoning reliability, with a panel-based re-scoring mechanism that stabilises predictions across interventions. Extensive experiments on two complex QA datasets demonstrate that Ca2KG consistently improves calibration while maintaining or even enhancing predictive accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出FairToT框架，通过推理时的提示引导提升LLM在毒性评估中的公平性，识别潜在的群体差异并决定是否需要额外评估。引入两个可解释的公平性指标，无需修改模型参数即可提高判断一致性。实验表明该方法有效降低群体间差异，保持预测稳定可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在毒性评估中对细微表达（尤其是隐含仇恨言论）存在不一致判断，且存在难以通过标准训练纠正的偏见，导致不同群体间评估不公平；但当前方法忽视了何时应启动纠正机制这一关键问题。

Method: 提出FairToT框架，基于提示引导进行推理时的毒性评估，自动识别可能产生性别、种族等群体相关偏差的情形，并决定是否触发额外评估；引入两个可解释的公平性指标以检测此类情况，提升推理一致性。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验结果显示，FairToT显著降低了群体间的评估差异，同时维持了稳定的毒性预测性能，验证了推理时优化在提升公平性方面的有效性与实用性。

Conclusion: 推理时的修正机制为提升LLM在毒性评估系统中的公平性提供了一种有效且实际的解决方案，无需修改模型参数即可实现更公正、一致的判断。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for toxicity assessment in online moderation systems, where fairness across demographic groups is essential for equitable treatment. However, LLMs often produce inconsistent toxicity judgements for subtle expressions, particularly those involving implicit hate speech, revealing underlying biases that are difficult to correct through standard training. This raises a key question that existing approaches often overlook: when should corrective mechanisms be invoked to ensure fair and reliable assessments? To address this, we propose FairToT, an inference-time framework that enhances LLM fairness through prompt-guided toxicity assessment. FairToT identifies cases where demographic-related variation is likely to occur and determines when additional assessment should be applied. In addition, we introduce two interpretable fairness indicators that detect such cases and improve inference consistency without modifying model parameters. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that FairToT reduces group-level disparities while maintaining stable and reliable toxicity predictions, demonstrating that inference-time refinement offers an effective and practical approach for fairness improvement in LLM-based toxicity assessment systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大模型在古典汉语文本研究中主要关注文本与视觉模态，而音频资源尚未被充分开发，亟需构建专门的音频语料库以推动相关研究。

Method: 构建MCGA语料库，包含六种任务的音频数据；采用十种多模态大模型进行评测，并设计针对语音情感描述的新评估指标及语音-文本一致性度量方法。

Result: 实验结果表明现有模型在处理MCGA测试集时面临显著挑战，验证了语料库的有效性与研究价值；所提评估指标能有效反映模型在语音与文本融合能力上的表现。

Conclusion: MCGA为古典汉语文本领域提供了重要的多模态音频资源，有助于促进多模态大模型在语音理解与推理方面的进步，提升其在传统文化研究中的应用潜力。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), their potential has garnered significant attention in Chinese Classical Studies (CCS). While existing research has primarily focused on text and visual modalities, the audio corpus within this domain remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose the Multi-task Classical Chinese Literary Genre Audio Corpus (MCGA). It encompasses a diverse range of literary genres across six tasks: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT), Speech Emotion Captioning (SEC), Spoken Question Answering (SQA), Speech Understanding (SU), and Speech Reasoning (SR). Through the evaluation of ten MLLMs, our experimental results demonstrate that current models still face substantial challenges when processed on the MCGA test set. Furthermore, we introduce an evaluation metric for SEC and a metric to measure the consistency between the speech and text capabilities of MLLMs. We release MCGA and our code to the public to facilitate the development of MLLMs with more robust multidimensional audio capabilities in CCS.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReGraM提出一种以区域为中心的知识图谱推理框架，通过构建与查询对齐的子图，并在多证据感知模式下进行受限的逐步推理，聚焦于最相关的知识片段，从而提升医学问答中的事实准确性和一致性。实验表明，该方法在多个基准上显著优于基线模型，尤其在多选题和开放式问答中分别取得8.04%和4.50%的准确率提升，并大幅降低幻觉率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学问答方法依赖全图遍历或大规模检索，引入大量噪声，导致多跳推理不稳定；核心问题不在于扩大知识访问，而在于精准识别并推理相关证据子集。

Method: ReGraM采用区域优先策略，先构建与查询对齐的局部子图，再在该区域内进行分步推理，结合多证据感知机制，限制推理范围以提升准确性。

Result: 在七个医学QA基准上，ReGraM相比强基线KGARevion，在MCQ上提升8.04%准确率，SAQ上提升4.50%，幻觉率降低42.9%；消融实验表明，区域构建与分步推理的对齐是性能提升的关键。

Conclusion: 区域优先的知识图谱推理是提升医学问答中事实准确性和一致性的有效范式。

Abstract: Recent studies in medical question answering (Medical QA) have actively explored the integration of large language models (LLMs) with biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) to improve factual accuracy. However, most existing approaches still rely on traversing the entire KG or performing large-scale retrieval, which introduces substantial noise and leads to unstable multi-hop reasoning. We argue that the core challenge lies not in expanding access to knowledge, but in identifying and reasoning over the appropriate subset of evidence for each query. ReGraM is a region-first knowledge graph reasoning framework that addresses this challenge by constructing a query-aligned subgraph and performing stepwise reasoning constrained to this localized region under multiple evidence aware modes. By focusing inference on only the most relevant portion of the KG, ReGraM departs from the assumption that all relations are equally useful an assumption that rarely holds in domain-specific medical settings. Experiments on seven medical QA benchmarks demonstrate that ReGraM consistently outperforms a strong baseline (KGARevion), achieving an 8.04% absolute accuracy gain on MCQ, a 4.50% gain on SAQ, and a 42.9% reduction in hallucination rate. Ablation and qualitative analyses further show that aligning region construction with hop-wise reasoning is the primary driver of these improvements. Overall, our results highlight region-first KG reasoning as an effective paradigm for improving factual accuracy and consistency in medical QA.

TL;DR: 本文研究德语定冠词的性别和格变化，使用梯度可解释性方法GRADIEND分析参数更新方向。发现特定性别-格组合的更新常影响无关的其他组合，且受影响神经元高度重叠，表明模型可能依赖记忆而非抽象规则来处理语法一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语言模型在语法一致任务中是基于规则泛化还是记忆化学习，特别是针对德语定冠词的性别和格变化。

Method: 采用GRADIEND这一基于梯度的可解释性方法，识别与特定性别-格组合相关的参数更新方向，并分析这些更新对其他组合的影响及神经元重叠情况。

Result: 特定性别-格组合的参数更新会影响其他不相关的性别-格设置，且最受影响的神经元在不同组合间存在显著重叠，说明模型并非严格遵循规则编码。

Conclusion: 语言模型在处理德语定冠词时，至少部分依赖于记忆化的关联，而非完全基于抽象的语法规则。

Abstract: Language models perform well on grammatical agreement, but it is unclear whether this reflects rule-based generalization or memorization. We study this question for German definite singular articles, whose forms depend on gender and case. Using GRADIEND, a gradient-based interpretability method, we learn parameter update directions for gender-case specific article transitions. We find that updates learned for a specific gender-case article transition frequently affect unrelated gender-case settings, with substantial overlap among the most affected neurons across settings. These results argue against a strictly rule-based encoding of German definite articles, indicating that models at least partly rely on memorized associations rather than abstract grammatical rules.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非英语临床信息抽取领域缺乏标注数据，限制了以英语为主的大语言模型方法的评估，亟需跨语言基准与适配技术来推动多语言临床自然语言处理发展。

Method: 构建英文-土耳其语平行临床关系抽取数据集；采用多种提示策略（包括in-context learning、Chain-of-Thought）进行系统评估；提出关系感知检索（RAR）方法，利用对比学习捕捉句级与关系级语义；对比微调模型（如PURE）与不同提示方法的性能差异。

Result: 基于提示的LLM方法整体表现优于微调模型；英文任务性能普遍高于土耳其语；RAR方法在所有ICL方法中表现最佳，Gemini 1.5 Flash在英文上达0.906微平均F1，土耳其语为0.888；结合结构化推理提示后，DeepSeek-V3在英文上提升至0.918 F1。

Conclusion: 高质量示例检索与先进提示技术对提升非英语临床自然语言处理性能至关重要，有助于缓解低资源语言下的数据稀缺问题，具有重要的实践价值与研究意义。

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated datasets for clinical information extraction in non-English languages hinders the evaluation of large language model (LLM)-based methods developed primarily in English. In this study, we present the first comprehensive bilingual evaluation of LLMs for the clinical Relation Extraction (RE) task in both English and Turkish. To facilitate this evaluation, we introduce the first English-Turkish parallel clinical RE dataset, derived and carefully curated from the 2010 i2b2/VA relation classification corpus. We systematically assess a diverse set of prompting strategies, including multiple in-context learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches, and compare their performance to fine-tuned baselines such as PURE. Furthermore, we propose Relation-Aware Retrieval (RAR), a novel in-context example selection method based on contrastive learning, that is specifically designed to capture both sentence-level and relation-level semantics. Our results show that prompting-based LLM approaches consistently outperform traditional fine-tuned models. Moreover, evaluations for English performed better than their Turkish counterparts across all evaluated LLMs and prompting techniques. Among ICL methods, RAR achieves the highest performance, with Gemini 1.5 Flash reaching a micro-F1 score of 0.906 in English and 0.888 in Turkish. Performance further improves to 0.918 F1 in English when RAR is combined with a structured reasoning prompt using the DeepSeek-V3 model. These findings highlight the importance of high-quality demonstration retrieval and underscore the potential of advanced retrieval and prompting techniques to bridge resource gaps in clinical natural language processing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过引入ImperfectiveNLI诊断数据集，探究大语言模型（LLMs）是否真正理解事件的组合语义。结果显示，模型存在强烈的“目的性偏见”，倾向于错误地假设目标导向事件已完成，即使文本明确否定。尽管内部表示能区分过程与结果，但推理决策受强烈先验影响。提示工程虽减少幻觉，却也导致有效蕴含被错误拒绝。结论认为当前LLMs缺乏结构化的体态意识，更像预测性叙事引擎而非忠实的逻辑推理者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型是否真正理解事件的组合语义，特别是体态（aspect）相关的逻辑关系，以揭示其推理机制是否基于深层语义还是表面概率模式。

Method: 构建ImperfectiveNLI诊断数据集，评估多个先进开源模型在不同语义类别上的表现；结合表示分析和提示干预实验，考察模型内部表征与推理偏差之间的关系。

Result: 发现模型普遍存在对目标导向事件的完成性幻觉，即使有否定线索也难以纠正；提示干预可降低幻觉，但增加对正确蕴含的误拒；内部嵌入虽能区分过程与结果，但推理受强先验支配。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型缺乏结构化的体态意识，其行为更接近预测性叙事引擎，而非忠实的逻辑推理系统。

Abstract: Do Large Language Models (LLMs) genuinely grasp the compositional semantics of events, or do they rely on surface-level probabilistic heuristics? We investigate the Imperfective Paradox, a logical phenomenon where the past progressive aspect entails event realization for activities (e.g., running $\to$ ran) but not for accomplishments (e.g., building $\nrightarrow$ built). We introduce ImperfectiveNLI, a diagnostic dataset designed to probe this distinction across diverse semantic classes. Evaluating state-of-the-art open-weight models, we uncover a pervasive Teleological Bias: models systematically hallucinate completion for goal-oriented events, often overriding explicit textual negation. Representational analyses show that while internal embeddings often distinguish process from result, inference decisions are dominated by strong priors about goal attainment. We further find that prompting-based interventions reduce hallucinated completions but also increase incorrect rejections of valid entailments. Our findings suggest that current LLMs lack structural aspectual awareness, operating as predictive narrative engines rather than faithful logical reasoners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在持续预训练或微调过程中常出现灾难性遗忘，导致原有能力下降。如何在不损害已有技能的前提下，高效恢复或迁移特定能力，是当前研究的关键挑战。

Method: 通过分析不同领域和语言输入下模型各层模块的激活情况，识别出能力相关的高浓度通道；基于激活差异定位这些通道，选择性地转移对应参数，并进行轻量级微调以确保兼容性。

Result: 实验表明，ACT能有效恢复被遗忘的能力，同时保持原有技能不受影响；可成功将多个专业化模型融合为一个具备多能力的统一模型，且干扰极小。

Conclusion: ACT提供了一种高效、低干扰的能力迁移与整合机制，为大语言模型的持续学习和多能力集成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models can be continually pre-trained or fine-tuned to improve performance in specific domains, languages, or skills, but this specialization often degrades other capabilities and may cause catastrophic forgetting. We investigate how abilities are distributed within LLM parameters by analyzing module activations under domain- and language-specific inputs for closely related models. Across layers and modules, we find that ability-related activations are highly concentrated in a small set of channels (typically <5\%), and these channels are largely disentangled with good sufficiency and stability. Building on these observations, we propose ACT (Activation-Guided Channel-wise Ability Transfer), which localizes ability-relevant channels via activation differences and selectively transfers only the corresponding parameters, followed by lightweight fine-tuning for compatibility. Experiments on multilingual mathematical and scientific reasoning show that ACT can recover forgotten abilities while preserving retained skills. It can also merge multiple specialized models to integrate several abilities into a single model with minimal interference. Our code and data will be publicly released.

TL;DR: PAGER is a page-driven framework for RAG that uses structured cognitive outlines to iteratively build coherent, information-dense knowledge representations by populating distinct knowledge slots. It outperforms existing RAG methods in knowledge-intensive tasks and improves knowledge utilization while reducing conflicts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing iterative RAG methods lack coherent structure in knowledge accumulation, leading to fragmented and less effective knowledge representations. This limits the model's ability to leverage external knowledge comprehensively.

Method: PAGER first generates a structured cognitive outline with distinct knowledge slots via an LLM prompt. It then iteratively retrieves and refines documents to fill each slot, constructing a cohesive knowledge page used as context for answer generation.

Result: PAGER achieves superior performance across multiple knowledge-intensive benchmarks and backbone models. It constructs higher-quality, denser knowledge representations, better resolves knowledge conflicts, and enhances LLMs' use of external knowledge.

Conclusion: PAGER effectively enables structured, autonomous knowledge representation in RAG by organizing information into coherent pages, significantly improving retrieval and generation quality in knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge. Recently, some works have incorporated iterative knowledge accumulation processes into RAG models to progressively accumulate and refine query-related knowledge, thereby constructing more comprehensive knowledge representations. However, these iterative processes often lack a coherent organizational structure, which limits the construction of more comprehensive and cohesive knowledge representations. To address this, we propose PAGER, a page-driven autonomous knowledge representation framework for RAG. PAGER first prompts an LLM to construct a structured cognitive outline for a given question, which consists of multiple slots representing a distinct knowledge aspect. Then, PAGER iteratively retrieves and refines relevant documents to populate each slot, ultimately constructing a coherent page that serves as contextual input for guiding answer generation. Experiments on multiple knowledge-intensive benchmarks and backbone models show that PAGER consistently outperforms all RAG baselines. Further analyses demonstrate that PAGER constructs higher-quality and information-dense knowledge representations, better mitigates knowledge conflicts, and enables LLMs to leverage external knowledge more effectively.

*Filip Trhlik,Andrew Caines,Paula Buttery*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出使用低成本的微型语言模型（BabyLMs）来实现预训练阶段的去偏研究，通过在小型可变语料上训练紧凑的BERT类模型，模拟大型模型的偏见形成与学习动态。实验表明，BabyLMs与标准BERT模型在内在偏见形成和性能发展方面表现出高度一致性，并且在多种去偏方法中保持相关性。利用这些相似性，作者在BabyLMs上进行了预模型去偏实验，验证了已有结论并揭示了性别不平衡和毒性对偏见形成的影响。该方法将预训练成本从超过500 GPU小时降低至不到30 GPU小时，显著降低了研究门槛，推动了更快速、更公平的语言模型开发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大模型的训练成本高昂，现有去偏研究多依赖于后处理或掩码策略，难以触及偏见的根本成因。为降低研究门槛并促进对偏见形成机制的理解，亟需一种低成本、可快速迭代的替代方案。

Method: 引入BabyLMs——一种小型、紧凑的BERT类模型，基于小规模且可修改的语料库进行训练，用以模拟大规模语言模型的偏见获取过程与学习动态。通过对比分析其偏见模式与性能演变，验证其与大型模型的一致性，并在此基础上开展预模型去偏实验。

Result: BabyLMs在内在偏见形成和性能发展方面与标准BERT模型高度一致，跨多种去偏方法具有强相关性；基于BabyLMs的预模型去偏实验成功复现了先前结果，并揭示了性别不平衡和毒性对偏见形成的显著影响；预训练成本由超过500 GPU小时降至不足30 GPU小时。

Conclusion: BabyLMs能够有效作为大型语言模型的去偏研究沙盒，大幅降低计算成本，提升研究效率与可及性，为构建更公平的语言模型提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (LMs) have, over the last few years, grown substantially in both societal adoption and training costs. This rapid growth in size has constrained progress in understanding and mitigating their biases. Since re-training LMs is prohibitively expensive, most debiasing work has focused on post-hoc or masking-based strategies, which often fail to address the underlying causes of bias. In this work, we seek to democratise pre-model debiasing research by using low-cost proxy models. Specifically, we investigate BabyLMs, compact BERT-like models trained on small and mutable corpora that can approximate bias acquisition and learning dynamics of larger models. We show that BabyLMs display closely aligned patterns of intrinsic bias formation and performance development compared to standard BERT models, despite their drastically reduced size. Furthermore, correlations between BabyLMs and BERT hold across multiple intra-model and post-model debiasing methods. Leveraging these similarities, we conduct pre-model debiasing experiments with BabyLMs, replicating prior findings and presenting new insights regarding the influence of gender imbalance and toxicity on bias formation. Our results demonstrate that BabyLMs can serve as an effective sandbox for large-scale LMs, reducing pre-training costs from over 500 GPU-hours to under 30 GPU-hours. This provides a way to democratise pre-model debiasing research and enables faster, more accessible exploration of methods for building fairer LMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于机制可解释性方法的框架，用于识别语言模型中预训练数据引起的内部知识冲突的位置和方式。研究发现特定内部组件负责编码不一致信息，并展示了如何在推理时通过可解释性方法干预和控制这些冲突知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作主要关注模型内部知识与外部资源之间的冲突，但未探讨预训练过程中产生的内部表示层面的知识冲突问题。

Method: 采用机制可解释性方法，定位并分析语言模型中由预训练数据引发的知识冲突。

Result: 发现特定内部组件编码了来自预训练数据的冲突知识，并证明可通过可解释性方法在推理阶段进行因果干预。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了语言模型内部知识冲突的来源，并展示了利用机制可解释性方法实现冲突知识控制的有效性。

Abstract: In language models (LMs), intra-memory knowledge conflict largely arises when inconsistent information about the same event is encoded within the model's parametric knowledge. While prior work has primarily focused on resolving conflicts between a model's internal knowledge and external resources through approaches such as fine-tuning or knowledge editing, the problem of localizing conflicts that originate during pre-training within the model's internal representations remain unexplored. In this work, we design a framework based on mechanistic interpretability methods to identify where and how conflicting knowledge from the pre-training data is encoded within LMs. Our findings contribute to a growing body of evidence that specific internal components of a language model are responsible for encoding conflicting knowledge from pre-training, and we demonstrate how mechanistic interpretability methods can be leveraged to causally intervene in and control conflicting knowledge at inference time.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文针对小规模语言模型在将自然语言翻译为一阶逻辑时易出错的问题，提出通过分类错误、利用大模型合成数据进行微调，并引入分阶段推理（先谓词生成后逻辑翻译）和验证模块来提升生成质量与推理性能。实验表明该方法显著降低错误率、提高谓词覆盖率并增强小模型的符号推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小规模语言模型在将自然语言翻译为一阶逻辑时容易因格式或翻译错误产生不正确输出，现有自迭代方法依赖模型自身能力，难以有效纠错。因此需要更可控、可验证的改进方案以提升小模型的符号推理可靠性。

Method: 1. 分类常见错误类型；2. 用大模型合成数据对小模型进行微调；3. 提出增量推理框架，分两阶段进行谓词生成与一阶逻辑翻译；4. 引入验证模块专门检测和纠正谓词元数错误。

Result: 在四个逻辑推理数据集上，三种模型家族均表现出更低的错误率、更高的谓词覆盖度以及更强的推理性能，证明了该方法在提升小模型符号推理能力方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过综合采用数据增强、增量推理与验证机制，显著提升了小规模语言模型在符号逻辑推理任务中的表现，推动了可靠且可访问的符号推理系统的发展。

Abstract: The use of formal language for deductive logical reasoning aligns well with language models (LMs), where translating natural language (NL) into first-order logic (FOL) and employing an external solver results in a verifiable and therefore reliable reasoning system. However, smaller LMs often struggle with this translation task, frequently producing incorrect symbolic outputs due to formatting and translation errors. Existing approaches typically rely on self-iteration to correct these errors, but such methods depend heavily on the capabilities of the underlying model. To address this, we first categorize common errors and fine-tune smaller LMs using data synthesized by large language models. The evaluation is performed using the defined error categories. We introduce incremental inference, which divides inference into two stages, predicate generation and FOL translation, providing greater control over model behavior and enhancing generation quality as measured by predicate metrics. This decomposition framework also enables the use of a verification module that targets predicate-arity errors to further improve performance. Our study evaluates three families of models across four logical-reasoning datasets. The comprehensive fine-tuning, incremental inference, and verification modules reduce error rates, increase predicate coverage, and improve reasoning performance for smaller LMs, moving us closer to developing reliable and accessible symbolic-reasoning systems.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has fostered diverse paradigms for automated slide generation, ranging from code-driven layouts to image-centric synthesis. However, evaluating these heterogeneous systems remains challenging, as existing protocols often struggle to provide comparable scores across architectures or rely on uncalibrated judgments. In this paper, we introduce SlidesGen-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate slide generation through a lens of three core principles: universality, quantification, and reliability. First, to establish a unified evaluation framework, we ground our analysis in the visual domain, treating terminal outputs as renderings to remain agnostic to the underlying generation method. Second, we propose a computational approach that quantitatively assesses slides across three distinct dimensions - Content, Aesthetics, and Editability - offering reproducible metrics where prior works relied on subjective or reference-dependent proxies. Finally, to ensure high correlation with human preference, we construct the Slides-Align1.5k dataset, a human preference aligned dataset covering slides from nine mainstream generation systems across seven scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that SlidesGen-Bench achieves a higher degree of alignment with human judgment than existing evaluation pipelines. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/YunqiaoYang/SlidesGen-Bench.

Abstract: Scientific surveys require not only summarizing large bodies of literature, but also organizing them into clear and coherent conceptual structures. Existing automatic survey generation methods typically focus on linear text generation and struggle to explicitly model hierarchical relations among research topics and structured methodological comparisons, resulting in gaps in structural organization compared to expert-written surveys. We propose MVSS, a multi-view structured survey generation framework that jointly generates and aligns citation-grounded hierarchical trees, structured comparison tables, and survey text. MVSS follows a structure-first paradigm: it first constructs a conceptual tree of the research domain, then generates comparison tables constrained by the tree, and finally uses both as structural constraints for text generation. This enables complementary multi-view representations across structure, comparison, and narrative. We introduce an evaluation framework assessing structural quality, comparative completeness, and citation fidelity. Experiments on 76 computer science topics show MVSS outperforms existing methods in organization and evidence grounding, achieving performance comparable to expert surveys.

Conclusion: SERM有效应对了大规模工业场景下的相关性模型自进化难题，为动态查询环境中的持续学习提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Due to the dynamically evolving nature of real-world query streams, relevance models struggle to generalize to practical search scenarios. A sophisticated solution is self-evolution techniques. However, in large-scale industrial settings with massive query streams, this technique faces two challenges: (1) informative samples are often sparse and difficult to identify, and (2) pseudo-labels generated by the current model could be unreliable. To address these challenges, in this work, we propose a Self-Evolving Relevance Model approach (SERM), which comprises two complementary multi-agent modules: a multi-agent sample miner, designed to detect distributional shifts and identify informative training samples, and a multi-agent relevance annotator, which provides reliable labels through a two-level agreement framework. We evaluate SERM in a large-scale industrial setting, which serves billions of user requests daily. Experimental results demonstrate that SERM can achieve significant performance gains through iterative self-evolution, as validated by extensive offline multilingual evaluations and online testing.

Motivation: 当前多数后训练量化（PTQ）算法集中于整数量化，对微尺度浮点（MXFP）格式的应用与行为研究不足，亟需系统探索以推动低精度大语言模型的高效部署。

Method: 系统评估超过7种PTQ算法在三种主流大语言模型家族上的表现，覆盖15个评估基准，全面分析不同MXFP格式（如MXFP8、MXFP4）下的量化效果与稳定性，并通过消融实验揭示关键影响因素。

Result: MXFP8实现近似无损性能，MXFP4带来显著精度下降；量化效果受格式兼容性显著影响，部分算法范式更优；跨模型家族与模态的量化趋势一致，语言模型主导量化敏感性；缩放因子是MXFP4的主要误差来源，预缩放优化可有效缓解。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了MXFP格式下后训练量化研究的空白，为实际部署低精度大语言模型提供了可操作的技术路径和优化策略。

Abstract: Microscaling Floating-Point (MXFP) has emerged as a promising low-precision format for large language models (LLMs). Despite various post-training quantization (PTQ) algorithms being proposed, they mostly focus on integer quantization, while their applicability and behavior under MXFP formats remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, this work conducts a systematic investigation of PTQ under MXFP formats, encompassing over 7 PTQ algorithms, 15 evaluation benchmarks, and 3 LLM families. The key findings include: 1) MXFP8 consistently achieves near-lossless performance, while MXFP4 introduces substantial accuracy degradation and remains challenging; 2) PTQ effectiveness under MXFP depends strongly on format compatibility, with some algorithmic paradigms being consistently more effective than others; 3) PTQ performance exhibits highly consistent trends across model families and modalities, in particular, quantization sensitivity is dominated by the language model rather than the vision encoder in multimodal LLMs; 4) The scaling factor of quantization is a critical error source in MXFP4, and a simple pre-scale optimization strategy can significantly mitigate its impact. Together, these results provide practical guidance on adapting existing PTQ methods to MXFP quantization.

Abstract: Autonomous systems conducting schema-grounded information-gathering dialogues face an instrumentation gap, lacking turn-level observables for monitoring acquisition efficiency and detecting when questioning becomes unproductive. We introduce Dialogue Telemetry (DT), a measurement framework that produces two model-agnostic signals after each question-answer exchange: (i) a Progress Estimator (PE) quantifying residual information potential per category (with a bits-based variant), and (ii) a Stalling Index (SI) detecting an observable failure signature characterized by repeated category probing with semantically similar, low-marginal-gain responses. SI flags this pattern without requiring causal diagnosis, supporting monitoring in settings where attributing degradation to specific causes may be impractical. We validate DT in controlled search-and-rescue (SAR)-inspired interviews using large language model (LLM)-based simulations, distinguishing efficient from stalled dialogue traces and illustrating downstream utility by integrating DT signals into a reinforcement learning (RL) policy. Across these settings, DT provides interpretable turn-level instrumentation that improves policy performance when stalling carries operational costs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based enhancement of large language models (LLMs) often leads to reduced output diversity, undermining their utility in open-ended tasks like creative writing. Current methods lack explicit mechanisms for guiding diverse exploration and instead prioritize optimization efficiency and performance over diversity. This paper proposes an RL framework structured around a semi-structured long Chain-of-Thought (CoT), in which the generation process is decomposed into explicitly planned intermediate steps. We introduce a Diverse Planning Branching method that strategically introduces divergence at the planning phase based on diversity variation, alongside a group-aware diversity reward to encourage distinct trajectories. Experimental results on creative writing benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves output diversity without compromising generation quality, consistently outperforming existing baselines.

Abstract: Taxonomies form the backbone of structured knowledge representation across diverse domains, enabling applications such as e-commerce catalogs, semantic search, and biomedical discovery. Yet, manual taxonomy expansion is labor-intensive and cannot keep pace with the emergence of new concepts. Existing automated methods rely on point-based vector embeddings, which model symmetric similarity and thus struggle with the asymmetric "is-a" relationships that are fundamental to taxonomies. Box embeddings offer a promising alternative by enabling containment and disjointness, but they face key issues: (i) unstable gradients at the intersection boundaries, (ii) no notion of semantic uncertainty, and (iii) limited capacity to represent polysemy or ambiguity. We address these shortcomings with TaxoBell, a Gaussian box embedding framework that translates between box geometries and multivariate Gaussian distributions, where means encode semantic location and covariances encode uncertainty. Energy-based optimization yields stable optimization, robust modeling of ambiguous concepts, and interpretable hierarchical reasoning. Extensive experimentation on five benchmark datasets demonstrates that TaxoBell significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art taxonomy expansion baselines by 19% in MRR and around 25% in Recall@k. We further demonstrate the advantages and pitfalls of TaxoBell with error analysis and ablation studies.

Motivation: 现有LLM路由器依赖真实标注数据，但在实际中用户请求分布异构且未知，难以获取标签数据。因此需要在无真实标签情况下仍能有效工作的路由器训练方法。

Method: 提出RGD设置，仅使用生成的查询与答案进行训练；分析生成质量对不同路由方法的影响；设计CASCAL路由器，利用共识投票估计正确性，通过层次聚类识别模型技能专长，实现仅用查询信息的鲁棒路由。

Conclusion: 在缺乏真实标签的情况下，基于生成数据训练的查询仅路由器（如CASCAL）更具鲁棒性；生成数据的质量取决于生成器的自一致性与区分能力；通过针对性筛选与创新路由机制，可在无监督条件下实现高效、可靠的模型选择。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) routers dynamically select optimal models for given inputs. Existing approaches typically assume access to ground-truth labeled data, which is often unavailable in practice, especially when user request distributions are heterogeneous and unknown. We introduce Routing with Generated Data (RGD), a challenging setting in which routers are trained exclusively on generated queries and answers produced from high-level task descriptions by generator LLMs. We evaluate query-answer routers (using both queries and labels) and query-only routers across four diverse benchmarks and 12 models, finding that query-answer routers degrade faster than query-only routers as generator quality decreases. Our analysis reveals two crucial characteristics of effective generators: they must accurately respond to their own questions, and their questions must produce sufficient performance differentiation among the model pool. We then show how filtering for these characteristics can improve the quality of generated data. We further propose CASCAL, a novel query-only router that estimates model correctness through consensus voting and identifies model-specific skill niches via hierarchical clustering. CASCAL is substantially more robust to generator quality, outperforming the best query-answer router by 4.6% absolute accuracy when trained on weak generator data.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly being integrated into clinical workflows, yet they often lack clinical empathy, an essential aspect of effective doctor-patient communication. Existing NLP frameworks focus on reactively labeling empathy in doctors' responses but offer limited support for anticipatory modeling of empathy needs, especially in general health queries. We introduce the Empathy Applicability Framework (EAF), a theory-driven approach that classifies patient queries in terms of the applicability of emotional reactions and interpretations, based on clinical, contextual, and linguistic cues. We release a benchmark of real patient queries, dual-annotated by Humans and GPT-4o. In the subset with human consensus, we also observe substantial human-GPT alignment. To validate EAF, we train classifiers on human-labeled and GPT-only annotations to predict empathy applicability, achieving strong performance and outperforming the heuristic and zero-shot LLM baselines. Error analysis highlights persistent challenges: implicit distress, clinical-severity ambiguity, and contextual hardship, underscoring the need for multi-annotator modeling, clinician-in-the-loop calibration, and culturally diverse annotation. EAF provides a framework for identifying empathy needs before response generation, establishes a benchmark for anticipatory empathy modeling, and enables supporting empathetic communication in asynchronous healthcare.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models often achieve strong results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks while remaining fragile on basic numerical understanding and arithmetic operations. A central limitation is that numbers are processed as symbolic tokens whose embeddings do not explicitly encode numerical value, leading to systematic errors. We introduce a value-aware numerical representation that augments standard tokenized inputs with a dedicated prefix token whose embedding is explicitly conditioned on the underlying numerical value. This mechanism injects magnitude information directly into the model's input space while remaining compatible with existing tokenizers and decoder-only Transformer architectures. Evaluation on arithmetic tasks shows that the proposed approach outperforms baselines across numerical formats, tasks, and operand lengths. These results indicate that explicitly encoding numerical value is an effective and efficient way to improve fundamental numerical robustness in language models.

### [120] [Spectral Generative Flow Models: A Physics-Inspired Replacement for Vectorized Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08893)
*Andrew Kiruluta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SGFMs introduce a physics-inspired generative model that treats text/video generation as continuous field evolution using wavelet-based stochastic dynamics, replacing attention with local operators and physical principles for improved coherence and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of transformer-based models like global attention and lack of physical structure, SGFMs aim to provide long-range coherence, multimodal generalization, and physically grounded inductive bias through a continuous, field-theoretic approach.

Method: SGFMs use a field-theoretic framework where text and video are modeled as trajectories of stochastic partial differential equations in a multiscale wavelet basis, employing spectral projections, local operators, and Navier--Stokes-like transport to ensure stability and coherence.

Result: The model achieves efficient, coherent generation with strong inductive bias from physical laws, enabling better long-range dependencies and multimodal performance compared to autoregressive and diffusion models.

Conclusion: SGFMs present a fundamental departure from existing generative architectures, offering a principled, physically structured approach to generation with potential for next-generation AI systems.

Abstract: We introduce Spectral Generative Flow Models (SGFMs), a physics-inspired alternative to transformer-based large language models. Instead of representing text or video as sequences of discrete tokens processed by attention, SGFMs treat generation as the evolution of a continuous field governed by constrained stochastic dynamics in a multiscale wavelet basis. This formulation replaces global attention with local operators, spectral projections, and Navier--Stokes-like transport, yielding a generative mechanism grounded in continuity, geometry, and physical structure.
  Our framework provides three key innovations: (i) a field-theoretic ontology in which text and video are unified as trajectories of a stochastic partial differential equation; (ii) a wavelet-domain representation that induces sparsity, scale separation, and computational efficiency; and (iii) a constrained stochastic flow that enforces stability, coherence, and uncertainty propagation. Together, these components define a generative architecture that departs fundamentally from autoregressive modeling and diffusion-based approaches. SGFMs offer a principled path toward long-range coherence, multimodal generality, and physically structured inductive bias in next-generation generative models.

Motivation: 金融时间序列预测，特别是新兴市场如尼泊尔股票交易所（NEPSE）指数，具有高度非线性和噪声特性，传统线性模型难以捕捉其复杂动态。现有方法在预测精度和可解释性方面存在局限，亟需更先进的机器学习框架来提升预测能力并支持实际应用。

Method: 采用XGBoost回归器构建预测模型，工程化包括30天内滞后对数收益率及多种技术指标（滚动波动率、相对强弱指数）的特征集；利用Optuna配合时间序列交叉验证进行超参数优化；通过扩展窗口与固定长度滚动窗口的走查验证策略评估模型在真实场景下的泛化能力，避免前瞻偏差；使用多种指标（RMSE、MAE、R-squared、方向准确率）综合评价性能。

Abstract: This study develops a robust machine learning framework for one-step-ahead forecasting of daily log-returns in the Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) Index using the XGBoost regressor. A comprehensive feature set is engineered, including lagged log-returns (up to 30 days) and established technical indicators such as short- and medium-term rolling volatility measures and the 14-period Relative Strength Index. Hyperparameter optimization is performed using Optuna with time-series cross-validation on the initial training segment. Out-of-sample performance is rigorously assessed via walk-forward validation under both expanding and fixed-length rolling window schemes across multiple lag configurations, simulating real-world deployment and avoiding lookahead bias. Predictive accuracy is evaluated using root mean squared error, mean absolute error, coefficient of determination (R-squared), and directional accuracy on both log-returns and reconstructed closing prices. Empirical results show that the optimal configuration, an expanding window with 20 lags, outperforms tuned ARIMA and Ridge regression benchmarks, achieving the lowest log-return RMSE (0.013450) and MAE (0.009814) alongside a directional accuracy of 65.15%. While the R-squared remains modest, consistent with the noisy nature of financial returns, primary emphasis is placed on relative error reduction and directional prediction. Feature importance analysis and visual inspection further enhance interpretability. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of gradient boosting ensembles in modeling nonlinear dynamics in volatile emerging market time series and establish a reproducible benchmark for NEPSE Index forecasting.

### [122] [DriftGuard: A Hierarchical Framework for Concept Drift Detection and Remediation in Supply Chain Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08928)
*Shahnawaz Alam,Mohammed Abdul Rahman,Bareera Sadeqa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DriftGuard is a comprehensive framework for detecting, diagnosing, and remedying concept drift in supply chain forecasting. It integrates multiple detection methods, hierarchical analysis, SHAP-based root cause diagnosis, and cost-aware retraining to improve forecast accuracy and ROI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing supply chain forecasting models degrade over time due to concept drift from changing market conditions, but current practices rely on manual monitoring and infrequent retraining, missing rapid changes and wasting resources. Academic methods lack holistic solutions addressing the full drift lifecycle.

Method: DriftGuard employs a five-module system: (1) ensemble detection using error monitoring, statistical tests, autoencoders, and CUSUM; (2) hierarchical propagation analysis to localize drift; (3) SHAP analysis for root cause explanation; (4) cost-aware retraining strategy; and (5) automated model correction.

Result: Evaluated on 30,000+ time series from the M5 dataset, DriftGuard achieves 97.8% detection recall within 4.2 days and delivers up to 417% return on investment through targeted model updates.

Conclusion: DriftGuard provides an end-to-end solution for real-time concept drift management in supply chains, significantly improving forecast reliability and operational efficiency by combining early detection, precise diagnosis, and intelligent remediation.

Abstract: Supply chain forecasting models degrade over time as real-world conditions change. Promotions shift, consumer preferences evolve, and supply disruptions alter demand patterns, causing what is known as concept drift. This silent degradation leads to stockouts or excess inventory without triggering any system warnings. Current industry practice relies on manual monitoring and scheduled retraining every 3-6 months, which wastes computational resources during stable periods while missing rapid drift events. Existing academic methods focus narrowly on drift detection without addressing diagnosis or remediation, and they ignore the hierarchical structure inherent in supply chain data. What retailers need is an end-to-end system that detects drift early, explains its root causes, and automatically corrects affected models. We propose DriftGuard, a five-module framework that addresses the complete drift lifecycle. The system combines an ensemble of four complementary detection methods, namely error-based monitoring, statistical tests, autoencoder anomaly detection, and Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) change-point analysis, with hierarchical propagation analysis to identify exactly where drift occurs across product lines. Once detected, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis diagnoses the root causes, and a cost-aware retraining strategy selectively updates only the most affected models. Evaluated on over 30,000 time series from the M5 retail dataset, DriftGuard achieves 97.8% detection recall within 4.2 days and delivers up to 417 return on investment through targeted remediation.

TL;DR: 本文通过逆向转移核（RTK）框架重新诠释了直接去噪扩散模型（DDDM），将确定性与随机扩散统一于同一概率形式下，揭示了确定性去噪在高效推理中的理论基础，并解决了分子扩散模型中的采样效率、数值稳定性与结构一致性等关键瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在分子设计中存在采样时间长、反向过程随机方差大、去噪动态缺乏结构感知等问题，尽管DDDM通过确定性去噪提升了效率，但其理论机制尚不清晰。

Result: RTK引导的确定性去噪在GEOM-DRUGS数据集上实现了更快收敛、更高结构保真度和更强化学有效性，且具备更好的数值稳定性和样本一致性。

Conclusion: 本研究为确定性扩散模型提供了坚实的理论基础，推动了分子生成中高效、稳定、结构敏感的生成方法发展。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models for molecular design, capable of capturing complex structural distributions and achieving high fidelity in 3D molecule generation. However, their widespread use remains constrained by long sampling trajectories, stochastic variance in the reverse process, and limited structural awareness in denoising dynamics. The Directly Denoising Diffusion Model (DDDM) mitigates these inefficiencies by replacing stochastic reverse MCMC updates with deterministic denoising step, substantially reducing inference time. Yet, the theoretical underpinnings of such deterministic updates have remained opaque. In this work, we provide a principled reinterpretation of DDDM through the lens of the Reverse Transition Kernel (RTK) framework by Huang et al. 2024, unifying deterministic and stochastic diffusion under a shared probabilistic formalism. By expressing the DDDM reverse process as an approximate kernel operator, we show that the direct denoising process implicitly optimizes a structured transport map between noisy and clean samples. This perspective elucidates why deterministic denoising achieves efficient inference. Beyond theoretical clarity, this reframing resolves several long-standing bottlenecks in molecular diffusion. The RTK view ensures numerical stability by enforcing well-conditioned reverse kernels, improves sample consistency by eliminating stochastic variance, and enables scalable and symmetry-preserving denoisers that respect SE(3) equivariance. Empirically, we demonstrate that RTK-guided deterministic denoising achieves faster convergence and higher structural fidelity than stochastic diffusion models, while preserving chemical validity across GEOM-DRUGS dataset. Code, models, and datasets are publicly available in our project repository.

Conclusion: 所提出的块级公平性模型与配套算法能够有效应对大规模数据流中的连续公平性挑战，具备高效率与强实用性，是实现精细化公平性保障的重要进展。

Abstract: We study the problem of enforcing continuous group fairness over windows in data streams. We propose a novel fairness model that ensures group fairness at a finer granularity level (referred to as block) within each sliding window. This formulation is particularly useful when the window size is large, making it desirable to enforce fairness at a finer granularity. Within this framework, we address two key challenges: efficiently monitoring whether each sliding window satisfies block-level group fairness, and reordering the current window as effectively as possible when fairness is violated. To enable real-time monitoring, we design sketch-based data structures that maintain attribute distributions with minimal overhead. We also develop optimal, efficient algorithms for the reordering task, supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees. Our evaluation on four real-world streaming scenarios demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our approach. We achieve millisecond-level processing and a throughput of approximately 30,000 queries per second on average, depending on system parameters. The stream reordering algorithm improves block-level group fairness by up to 95% in certain cases, and by 50-60% on average across datasets. A qualitative study further highlights the advantages of block-level fairness compared to window-level fairness.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of solar energetic particle events is vital for safeguarding satellites, astronauts, and space-based infrastructure. Modern space weather monitoring generates massive volumes of high-frequency, multivariate time series (MVTS) data from sources such as the Geostationary perational Environmental Satellites (GOES). Machine learning (ML) models trained on this data show strong predictive power, but most existing methods overlook domain-specific feasibility constraints. Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a key tool for improving model interpretability, yet existing approaches rarely enforce physical plausibility. This work introduces a Physics-Guided Counterfactual Explanation framework, a novel method for generating counterfactual explanations in time series classification tasks that remain consistent with underlying physical principles. Applied to solar energetic particles (SEP) forecasting, this framework achieves over 80% reduction in Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance increasing the proximity, produces counterfactual explanations with higher sparsity, and reduces runtime by nearly 50% compared to state-of-the-art baselines such as DiCE. Beyond numerical improvements, this framework ensures that generated counterfactual explanations are physically plausible and actionable in scientific domains. In summary, the framework generates counterfactual explanations that are both valid and physically consistent, while laying the foundation for scalable counterfactual generation in big data environments.

TL;DR: 本文比较了WSD学习率调度器在语言模型（Pythia类）和小型CNN（CIFAR10分类）上的表现，发现两者在训练信号、优化器路径特征和尖锐度动态方面具有定性相似性，表明不同架构的损失景观可能存在共享的几何特性，为高维优化问题的几何研究提供了新视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究WSD学习率调度器在不同模型架构中的表现是否具有普适性，以理解其性能背后的几何机制，并揭示非凸优化问题的共性几何特征。

Method: 通过对比Adam优化器在Pythia类语言模型与小CNN（CIFAR10分类任务）上使用WSD调度器时的训练路径、优化器轨迹和尖锐度动态，分析其行为差异与共性。

Result: 两种模型在训练信号、优化器路径特征和尖锐度演化方面表现出高度相似性，说明尽管模型结构不同，但其损失景观具有共同的几何特性。

Conclusion: WSD的成功可能并非仅限于变压器语言模型，而是反映了高维非凸优化中普遍存在的几何规律，提示未来研究应关注高维优化问题的通用几何结构。

Abstract: The Warmup Stable Decay (WSD) learning rate scheduler has recently become popular, largely due to its good performance and flexibility when training large language models. It remains an open question whether the remarkable performance of WSD - using a decaying learning rate for only a fraction of training compared to cosine decay - is a phenomenon specific to transformer-based language models that can potentially offer new theoretical insights into their training dynamics. Inspired by the usage of learning rate schedulers as a new lens into understanding landscape geometry (e.g., river valley, connected minima, progressive sharpening), in this work we compare the WSD path of the Adam optimizer on a Pythia-like language model to that of a small CNN trained to classify CIFAR10 images. We observe most training signals, optimizer path features, and sharpness dynamics to be qualitatively similar in such architectures. This consistency points to shared geometric characteristics of the loss landscapes of old and new nonconvex problems, and hints to future research questions around the geometry of high dimensional optimization problems.

TL;DR: 本文系统比较了传统深度学习（TDL）与基于元学习的算法在应对时间序列分类中数据偏移问题时的表现。研究引入了一个受控的任务导向地震基准测试集（SeisTask），发现元学习在数据稀缺和模型规模较小时能实现更快更稳定的适应，且过拟合较少；但随着数据量和模型容量增加，其优势减弱，TDL微调表现相当。此外，任务多样性并非关键，训练与测试分布的一致性才是性能提升的关键。研究为元学习在数据偏移下的适用条件提供了系统评估，并贡献了SeisTask作为时间序列领域自适应学习的研究基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在训练与测试数据分布一致时表现良好，但在现实世界中因数据动态变化（即数据偏移）导致性能迅速下降，需昂贵的重新标注和低效的重新训练。元学习通过少量样本快速适应新数据，为缓解此问题提供了潜在解决方案。

Method: 构建受控的时间序列分类基准测试集SeisTask，系统比较TDL微调与优化型元学习算法在不同数据量、模型规模及任务多样性条件下的表现，分析其在数据偏移下的适应能力。

Result: 在数据稀缺和小模型情况下，元学习显著优于TDL微调，具有更快的适应速度、更高的稳定性及更低的过拟合风险；当数据充足且模型容量大时，两者性能趋同。任务分布一致性比任务多样性更能促进元学习性能提升。

Conclusion: 元学习在数据偏移场景下，尤其在数据有限和模型较小的情况下，具有明显优势，但其收益随数据量和模型容量增加而降低。训练与测试分布的对齐是元学习成功的关键因素。研究贡献的SeisTask可推动时间序列领域自适应学习的发展。

Abstract: Across engineering and scientific domains, traditional deep learning (TDL) models perform well when training and test data share the same distribution. However, the dynamic nature of real-world data, broadly termed \textit{data shift}, renders TDL models prone to rapid performance degradation, requiring costly relabeling and inefficient retraining. Meta-learning, which enables models to adapt quickly to new data with few examples, offers a promising alternative for mitigating these challenges. Here, we systematically compare TDL with fine-tuning and optimization-based meta-learning algorithms to assess their ability to address data shift in time-series classification. We introduce a controlled, task-oriented seismic benchmark (SeisTask) and show that meta-learning typically achieves faster and more stable adaptation with reduced overfitting in data-scarce regimes and smaller model architectures. As data availability and model capacity increase, its advantages diminish, with TDL with fine-tuning performing comparably. Finally, we examine how task diversity influences meta-learning and find that alignment between training and test distributions, rather than diversity alone, drives performance gains. Overall, this work provides a systematic evaluation of when and why meta-learning outperforms TDL under data shift and contributes SeisTask as a benchmark for advancing adaptive learning research in time-series domains.

Abstract: This work addresses the fundamental problem of unbounded metric movement costs in bandit online convex optimization, by considering high-dimensional dynamic quadratic hitting costs and $\ell_2$-norm switching costs in a noisy bandit feedback model. For a general class of stochastic environments, we provide the first algorithm SCaLE that provably achieves a distribution-agnostic sub-linear dynamic regret, without the knowledge of hitting cost structure. En-route, we present a novel spectral regret analysis that separately quantifies eigenvalue-error driven regret and eigenbasis-perturbation driven regret. Extensive numerical experiments, against online-learning baselines, corroborate our claims, and highlight statistical consistency of our algorithm.

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) aims to discover shared cluster structures from multi-view data with partial observations. The core challenges lie in accurately imputing missing views without introducing bias, while maintaining semantic consistency across views and compactness within clusters. To address these challenges, we propose DIMVC-HIA, a novel deep IMVC framework that integrates hierarchical imputation and alignment with four key components: (1) view-specific autoencoders for latent feature extraction, coupled with a view-shared clustering predictor to produce soft cluster assignments; (2) a hierarchical imputation module that first estimates missing cluster assignments based on cross-view contrastive similarity, and then reconstructs missing features using intra-view, intra-cluster statistics; (3) an energy-based semantic alignment module, which promotes intra-cluster compactness by minimizing energy variance around low-energy cluster anchors; and (4) a contrastive assignment alignment module, which enhances cross-view consistency and encourages confident, well-separated cluster predictions. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance under varying levels of missingness.

Abstract: The existence of multiple, equally accurate models for a given predictive task leads to predictive multiplicity, where a ``Rashomon set'' of models achieve similar accuracy but diverges in their individual predictions. This inconsistency undermines trust in high-stakes applications where we want consistent predictions. We propose three approaches to reduce inconsistency among predictions for the members of the Rashomon set. The first approach is \textbf{outlier correction}. An outlier has a label that none of the good models are capable of predicting correctly. Outliers can cause the Rashomon set to have high variance predictions in a local area, so fixing them can lower variance. Our second approach is local patching. In a local region around a test point, models may disagree with each other because some of them are biased. We can detect and fix such biases using a validation set, which also reduces multiplicity. Our third approach is pairwise reconciliation, where we find pairs of models that disagree on a region around the test point. We modify predictions that disagree, making them less biased. These three approaches can be used together or separately, and they each have distinct advantages. The reconciled predictions can then be distilled into a single interpretable model for real-world deployment. In experiments across multiple datasets, our methods reduce disagreement metrics while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SRT是一种简单、无模型的加速方法，用于提高语言模型在策略学习中的推理效率，同时保持分布正确性。它通过为每个提示构建树状缓存来复用历史生成结果，并利用该缓存作为草稿模型进行推测解码。SRT在线更新缓存并利用空闲GPU时间进行预生成，显著降低生成延迟和每标记成本，在标准RL流程中实现最高2.08倍的实时加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习中的序列生成过程存在高延迟和高计算开销问题，尤其在多轮对话等场景下更为明显。尽管已有推测解码技术可提升效率，但其对分布正确性的潜在影响限制了在策略学习中的应用。因此，需要一种既高效又保持分布正确的加速方法。

Method: 提出Speculative Rollout with Tree-Structured Cache (SRT)，利用同一提示在不同训练步骤间的生成相似性，将历史生成内容以树结构形式缓存。在生成时，当前策略使用该树作为草稿模型进行推测解码；同时通过在线更新和利用空闲GPU进行提前生成，维持缓存的新鲜度与质量。

Result: SRT在多种RL算法（如PPO、GRPO、DAPO）及多轮设置下均有效，显著降低生成延迟、步延迟和每标记推理成本，最大实现2.08倍的墙钟时间加速，且不破坏分布正确性。

Conclusion: SRT提供了一种高效、通用且无需模型依赖的加速机制，可在不牺牲分布正确性的前提下大幅提升语言模型在策略学习中的推理效率，适用于广泛的实际应用场景。

Abstract: We present Speculative Rollout with Tree-Structured Cache (SRT), a simple, model-free approach to accelerate on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) for language models without sacrificing distributional correctness. SRT exploits the empirical similarity of rollouts for the same prompt across training steps by storing previously generated continuations in a per-prompt tree-structured cache. During generation, the current policy uses this tree as the draft model for performing speculative decoding. To keep the cache fresh and improve draft model quality, SRT updates trees online from ongoing rollouts and proactively performs run-ahead generation during idle GPU bubbles. Integrated into standard RL pipelines (\textit{e.g.}, PPO, GRPO and DAPO) and multi-turn settings, SRT consistently reduces generation and step latency and lowers per-token inference cost, achieving up to 2.08x wall-clock time speedup during rollout.

*Kangda Wei,Ruihong Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MMR-GRPO improves GRPO by using Maximal Marginal Relevance to prioritize diverse completions, reducing training steps and wall-clock time without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO is computationally expensive due to reliance on multiple completions per prompt; redundant completions provide limited learning signal, slowing convergence.

Method: Introduces MMR-GRPO, which reweights rewards based on completion diversity using Maximal Marginal Relevance to prioritize semantically distinct solutions.

Result: MMR-GRPO achieves comparable peak performance with 47.9% fewer training steps and 70.2% less wall-clock time across multiple model sizes, GRPO variants, and benchmarks.

Conclusion: Prioritizing diverse completions via MMR-GRPO significantly accelerates training while maintaining performance, making it a highly efficient approach for mathematical reasoning models.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has become a standard approach for training mathematical reasoning models; however, its reliance on multiple completions per prompt makes training computationally expensive. Although recent work has reduced the number of training steps required to reach peak performance, the overall wall-clock training time often remains unchanged or even increases due to higher per-step cost. We propose MMR-GRPO, which integrates Maximal Marginal Relevance to reweigh rewards based on completion diversity. Our key insight is that semantically redundant completions contribute limited marginal learning signal; prioritizing diverse solutions yields more informative updates and accelerates convergence. Extensive evaluations across three model sizes (1.5B, 7B, 8B), three GRPO variants, and five mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that MMR-GRPO achieves comparable peak performance while requiring on average 47.9% fewer training steps and 70.2% less wall-clock time. These gains are consistent across models, methods, and benchmarks. We will release our code, trained models, and experimental protocols.

TL;DR: DASD-4B-Thinking 是一个轻量级但高性能的开源推理模型，在数学、科学推理和代码生成等挑战性基准上达到同类规模开源模型的顶尖水平，甚至超越一些更大模型。研究指出当前序列级知识蒸馏方法存在三大缺陷：教师输出分布表示不足、师生能力不匹配、训练与推理阶段的暴露偏差。为此提出改进的蒸馏训练流程，仅用448K样本即取得优异表现，并公开模型与数据集以支持社区研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法主要基于SFT范式，忽视了蒸馏的核心目标——使学生模型完整学习教师模型的输出分布以继承其泛化能力。当前实践存在教师分布表示不充分、师生能力不匹配及训练时教师强制输入导致的暴露偏差等问题，导致蒸馏本质未被充分挖掘。

Method: 提出一种增强的序列级蒸馏训练管道，通过多项方法创新解决上述问题：改进教师输出分布建模，优化师生能力对齐机制，缓解暴露偏差，强化教师-学生间的显式交互，从而提升蒸馏效率与效果。

Result: DASD-4B-Thinking 在多个基准测试中表现卓越，达到同类模型中的SOTA水平，且仅使用448K训练样本，远少于多数现有开源项目，证明了所提方法的高效性。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了当前序列级蒸馏方法在理论设计上的系统性缺陷，并提出了有效解决方案。所提出的蒸馏框架显著提升了小样本条件下的模型性能，为未来轻量化高性能开源模型的发展提供了新范式。

Abstract: In this report, we introduce DASD-4B-Thinking, a lightweight yet highly capable, fully open-source reasoning model. It achieves SOTA performance among open-source models of comparable scale across challenging benchmarks in mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation -- even outperforming several larger models. We begin by critically reexamining a widely adopted distillation paradigm in the community: SFT on teacher-generated responses, also known as sequence-level distillation. Although a series of recent works following this scheme have demonstrated remarkable efficiency and strong empirical performance, they are primarily grounded in the SFT perspective. Consequently, these approaches focus predominantly on designing heuristic rules for SFT data filtering, while largely overlooking the core principle of distillation itself -- enabling the student model to learn the teacher's full output distribution so as to inherit its generalization capability. Specifically, we identify three critical limitations in current practice: i) Inadequate representation of the teacher's sequence-level distribution; ii) Misalignment between the teacher's output distribution and the student's learning capacity; and iii) Exposure bias arising from teacher-forced training versus autoregressive inference. In summary, these shortcomings reflect a systemic absence of explicit teacher-student interaction throughout the distillation process, leaving the essence of distillation underexploited. To address these issues, we propose several methodological innovations that collectively form an enhanced sequence-level distillation training pipeline. Remarkably, DASD-4B-Thinking obtains competitive results using only 448K training samples -- an order of magnitude fewer than those employed by most existing open-source efforts. To support community research, we publicly release our models and the training dataset.

Conclusion: STEP通过步骤级质量评估与内存驱动剪枝，有效平衡了推理效率与准确性，为大语言模型推理加速提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance reasoning capabilities through test-time scaling by generating multiple traces. However, the combination of lengthy reasoning traces with multiple sampling introduces substantial computation and high end-to-end latency. Prior work on accelerating this process has relied on similarity-based or confidence-based pruning, but these signals do not reliably indicate trace quality. To address these limitations, we propose STEP: Step-level Trace Evaluation and Pruning, a novel pruning framework that evaluates reasoning steps using hidden states and dynamically prunes unpromising traces during generation. We train a lightweight step scorer to estimate trace quality, and design a GPU memory-aware pruning strategy that triggers pruning as the GPU memory is saturated by KV cache to reduce end-to-end latency. Experiments across challenging reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that STEP reduces end-to-end inference latency by 45%-70% on average compared to self-consistency while also improving reasoning accuracy.

Conclusion: 所提出的特征融合方法在处理ECG数据不平衡与噪声方面表现优异，显著提升了分类准确率，优于当前所有已知算法。

Abstract: Imbalanced electrocardiogram (ECG) data hampers the efficacy and resilience of algorithms in the automated processing and interpretation of cardiovascular diagnostic information, which in turn impedes deep learning-based ECG classification. Notably, certain cardiac conditions that are infrequently encountered are disproportionately underrepresented in these datasets. Although algorithmic generation and oversampling of specific ECG signal types can mitigate class skew, there is a lack of consensus regarding the effectiveness of such techniques in ECG classification. Furthermore, the methodologies and scenarios of ECG acquisition introduce noise, further complicating the processing of ECG data. This paper presents a significantly enhanced ECG classifier that simultaneously addresses both class imbalance and noise-related challenges in ECG analysis, as observed in the CPSC 2018 dataset. Specifically, we propose the application of feature fusion based on the wavelet transform, with a focus on wavelet transform-based interclass fusion, to generate the training feature library and the test set feature library. Subsequently, the original training and test data are amalgamated with their respective feature databases, resulting in more balanced training and test datasets. Employing this approach, our ECG model achieves recognition accuracies of up to 99%, 98%, 97%, 98%, 96%, 92%, and 93% for Normal, AF, I-AVB, LBBB, RBBB, PAC, PVC, STD, and STE, respectively. Furthermore, the average recognition accuracy for these categories ranges between 92\% and 98\%. Notably, our proposed data fusion methodology surpasses any known algorithms in terms of ECG classification accuracy in the CPSC 2018 dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前财务透明度受限于缺乏大规模、高质量的规避性回答检测基准。现有方法难以捕捉复杂规避行为，尤其在真实场景中表现不佳。因此亟需构建具有多层级评估标准的可靠数据集，并开发更高效的标注与训练机制以提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Detecting evasive answers in earnings calls is critical for financial transparency, yet progress is hindered by the lack of large-scale benchmarks. We introduce EvasionBench, comprising 30,000 training samples and 1,000 human-annotated test samples (Cohen's Kappa 0.835) across three evasion levels. Our key contribution is a multi-model annotation framework leveraging a core insight: disagreement between frontier LLMs signals hard examples most valuable for training. We mine boundary cases where two strong annotators conflict, using a judge to resolve labels. This approach outperforms single-model distillation by 2.4 percent, with judge-resolved samples improving generalization despite higher training loss (0.421 vs 0.393) - evidence that disagreement mining acts as implicit regularization. Our trained model Eva-4B (4B parameters) achieves 81.3 percent accuracy, outperforming its base by 25 percentage points and approaching frontier LLM performance at a fraction of inference cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiSOL introduces a discrete solution operator learning framework that adapts to geometry-dependent structural changes in PDEs by modeling solver procedures in stages, enabling robust and accurate predictions across diverse geometries, including topological changes and discontinuous boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional neural operator learning assumes smooth variations in geometry, which fails in engineering scenarios with abrupt geometric changes such as topological shifts, boundary type changes, or domain alterations. This motivates the need for a method that can handle discrete structural changes while maintaining procedural consistency.

Method: DiSOL factorizes the solution process into three learnable stages: local contribution encoding, multiscale assembly, and implicit solution reconstruction on an embedded grid. These stages mimic classical discretization methods but are trained to adapt to varying geometries.

Result: DiSOL achieves stable and accurate solutions across various PDE problems—Poisson, advection-diffusion, linear elasticity, and spatiotemporal heat conduction—under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution geometries, including cases with discontinuous boundaries and topological changes.

Conclusion: DiSOL demonstrates that procedural operator representations are essential in geometry-dominated regimes, establishing discrete solution operator learning as a complementary and distinct direction in scientific machine learning.

Abstract: Neural operator learning accelerates PDE solution by approximating operators as mappings between continuous function spaces. Yet in many engineering settings, varying geometry induces discrete structural changes, including topological changes, abrupt changes in boundary conditions or boundary types, and changes in the effective computational domain, which break the smooth-variation premise. Here we introduce Discrete Solution Operator Learning (DiSOL), a complementary paradigm that learns discrete solution procedures rather than continuous function-space operators. DiSOL factorizes the solver into learnable stages that mirror classical discretizations: local contribution encoding, multiscale assembly, and implicit solution reconstruction on an embedded grid, thereby preserving procedure-level consistency while adapting to geometry-dependent discrete structures. Across geometry-dependent Poisson, advection-diffusion, linear elasticity, as well as spatiotemporal heat-conduction problems, DiSOL produces stable and accurate predictions under both in-distribution and strongly out-of-distribution geometries, including discontinuous boundaries and topological changes. These results highlight the need for procedural operator representations in geometry-dominated regimes and position discrete solution operator learning as a distinct, complementary direction in scientific machine learning.

Abstract: Using Artificial Intelligence to improve teaching and learning benefits greater adaptivity and scalability in education. Knowledge Tracing (KT) is recognized for student modeling task due to its superior performance and application potential in education. To this end, we conceptualize and investigate counterfactual explanation as the connection from XAI for KT to education. Counterfactual explanations offer actionable recourse, are inherently causal and local, and easy for educational stakeholders to understand who are often non-experts. We propose KTCF, a counterfactual explanation generation method for KT that accounts for knowledge concept relationships, and a post-processing scheme that converts a counterfactual explanation into a sequence of educational instructions. We experiment on a large-scale educational dataset and show our KTCF method achieves superior and robust performance over existing methods, with improvements ranging from 5.7% to 34% across metrics. Additionally, we provide a qualitative evaluation of our post-processing scheme, demonstrating that the resulting educational instructions help in reducing large study burden. We show that counterfactuals have the potential to advance the responsible and practical use of AI in education. Future works on XAI for KT may benefit from educationally grounded conceptualization and developing stakeholder-centered methods.

*G Dhinesh Chandran,Kota Srinivas Reddy,Srikrishna Bhashyam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work proposes computationally efficient, asymptotically optimal algorithms (EBC and EBC-H) for bandit clustering with non-Gaussian arms, achieving better performance and faster runtime than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the Bandit Clustering (BC) problem under the fixed confidence setting, aiming to group data sequences (arms) into clusters via sequential sampling while maintaining a fixed error probability at stopping time. Existing methods assume Gaussian-distributed arms and require computationally expensive optimization at each step.

Method: The authors propose an Efficient Bandit Clustering algorithm (EBC) that approximates the optimal solution by taking a single step toward it instead of solving the full optimization problem, improving computational efficiency. They also introduce EBC-H, a heuristic variant using quantities from the stopping rule for arm selection.

Result: Simulations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that EBC and EBC-H achieve significant performance gains over existing approaches while maintaining asymptotic optimality. EBC shows superior computational efficiency with lower per-sample run time compared to prior algorithms.

Conclusion: EBC and EBC-H provide efficient and asymptotically optimal solutions for bandit clustering under non-Gaussian distributions, offering practical advantages in both computation and performance.

Abstract: We study the Bandit Clustering (BC) problem under the fixed confidence setting, where the objective is to group a collection of data sequences (arms) into clusters through sequential sampling from adaptively selected arms at each time step while ensuring a fixed error probability at the stopping time. We consider a setting where arms in a cluster may have different distributions. Unlike existing results in this setting, which assume Gaussian-distributed arms, we study a broader class of vector-parametric distributions that satisfy mild regularity conditions. Existing asymptotically optimal BC algorithms require solving an optimization problem as part of their sampling rule at each step, which is computationally costly. We propose an Efficient Bandit Clustering algorithm (EBC), which, instead of solving the full optimization problem, takes a single step toward the optimal value at each time step, making it computationally efficient while remaining asymptotically optimal. We also propose a heuristic variant of EBC, called EBC-H, which further simplifies the sampling rule, with arm selection based on quantities computed as part of the stopping rule. We highlight the computational efficiency of EBC and EBC-H by comparing their per-sample run time with that of existing algorithms. The asymptotic optimality of EBC is supported through simulations on the synthetic datasets. Through simulations on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we show the performance gain of EBC and EBC-H over existing approaches.

Conclusion: 本研究构建了一个形式化、可扩展的多教师知识蒸馏理论框架，不仅揭示了不同聚合机制背后的共性原理，还为设计高效、稳健的多教师蒸馏策略提供了理论依据与灵活性。

Abstract: Building on the probability-domain distillation framework of Sparse-KD, we develop an axiomatic, operator-theoretic framework for multi-teacher ensemble knowledge distillation. Rather than prescribing a specific aggregation formula, we define five core axioms governing valid knowledge aggregation operators, encompassing convexity, positivity, continuity, weight monotonicity, and temperature coherence. We prove the existence and non-uniqueness of operator families satisfying these axioms, establishing that multiple distinct aggregation mechanisms conform to the same foundational principles.
  Within this framework, we establish operator-agnostic guarantees showing that multi-teacher aggregation reduces both stochastic variance and systematic supervisory bias under heterogeneous teachers, while providing Jensen-type bounds, log-loss guarantees, and safety attenuation properties. For aggregation operators linear in teacher weights, we further establish classical ensemble variance-reduction results under standard independence assumptions, with extensions to correlated-error regimes. The framework provides theoretical grounding for multi-teacher distillation from diverse frontier models while admitting multiple valid implementation strategies.

TL;DR: DP-FedSOFIM is a memory-efficient, server-side second-order method for differentially private federated learning that uses FIM-based preconditioning and the Sherman-Morrison formula to achieve O(d) complexity, enabling faster convergence and better accuracy than first-order methods while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differentially private federated learning (DP-FL) faces slow convergence under tight privacy budgets due to excessive noise. Existing second-order methods like DP-FedNew require high O(d^2) memory per client, limiting their scalability in high-dimensional settings.

Method: Propose DP-FedSOFIM, a server-side second-order optimization framework using the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) as a natural gradient preconditioner. It leverages the Sherman-Morrison formula for efficient matrix inversion, achieving O(d) memory and computational complexity per round.

Result: Empirical results on CIFAR-10 show DP-FedSOFIM outperforms first-order baselines in test accuracy across various privacy levels. The method preserves (epsilon, delta)-differential privacy via post-processing.

Conclusion: DP-FedSOFIM enables efficient, scalable second-order optimization in DP-FL with minimal memory and computational overhead, significantly improving convergence and performance under strict privacy constraints.

Abstract: Differentially private federated learning (DP-FL) suffers from slow convergence under tight privacy budgets due to the overwhelming noise introduced to preserve privacy. While adaptive optimizers can accelerate convergence, existing second-order methods such as DP-FedNew require O(d^2) memory at each client to maintain local feature covariance matrices, making them impractical for high-dimensional models. We propose DP-FedSOFIM, a server-side second-order optimization framework that leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) as a natural gradient preconditioner while requiring only O(d) memory per client. By employing the Sherman-Morrison formula for efficient matrix inversion, DP-FedSOFIM achieves O(d) computational complexity per round while maintaining the convergence benefits of second-order methods. Our analysis proves that the server-side preconditioning preserves (epsilon, delta)-differential privacy through the post-processing theorem. Empirical evaluation on CIFAR-10 demonstrates that DP-FedSOFIM achieves superior test accuracy compared to first-order baselines across multiple privacy regimes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM unlearning方法在处理忘记集合中的样本时存在难度差异导致的遗忘异步问题，部分知识未充分消除而另一些则被过度遗忘，亟需一种平衡且高效的遗忘机制。

Method: 将未学习建模为一个最小-最大优化过程：内层步骤识别强调难遗忘样本的最坏情况数据分布，外层步骤基于该分布更新模型参数；提出BalDRO-G（基于GroupDRO的离散近似）与BalDRO-DV（基于Donsker-Varadhan对偶的连续方法），支持高效适应训练流程。

Conclusion: BalDRO是一种高效、平衡的大型语言模型遗忘框架，能有效缓解样本间遗忘难度不均的问题，兼顾遗忘质量与模型性能。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly shape online content, removing targeted information from well-trained LLMs (also known as LLM unlearning) has become critical for web governance. A key challenge lies in sample-wise imbalance within the forget set: different samples exhibit widely varying unlearning difficulty, leading to asynchronous forgetting where some knowledge remains insufficiently erased while others become over-forgotten. To address this, we propose BalDRO, a novel and efficient framework for balanced LLM unlearning. BalDRO formulates unlearning as a min-sup process: an inner step identifies a worst-case data distribution that emphasizes hard-to-unlearn samples, while an outer step updates model parameters under this distribution. We instantiate BalDRO via two efficient variants: BalDRO-G, a discrete GroupDRO-based approximation focusing on high-loss subsets, and BalDRO-DV, a continuous Donsker-Varadhan dual method enabling smooth adaptive weighting within standard training pipelines. Experiments on TOFU and MUSE show that BalDRO significantly improves both forgetting quality and model utility over existing methods, and we release code for reproducibility.

### [143] [Geometric Stability: The Missing Axis of Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09173)
*Prashant C. Raju*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出几何稳定性（geometric stability）作为分析学习表征的新维度，用以衡量表示结构在扰动下的可靠性。与传统相似性度量不同，几何稳定性不关注嵌入是否对齐外部参考，而是关注其结构是否稳健。研究构建了名为Shesha的框架来测量该特性，并在七个领域2,463种配置中验证了稳定性与相似性几乎无关（ρ≈0.01），且机制上独立：相似性度量在去除主成分后崩溃，而稳定性仍能捕捉细微流形结构。应用层面，稳定性可更灵敏地检测结构漂移（比CKA高近2倍），过滤非功能噪声；预测线性可控性（ρ=0.89–0.96）；揭示迁移优化带来的几何代价。此外，该指标还适用于生物系统，如预测CRISPR扰动一致性与神经-行为耦合。几何稳定性为审计计算与生物系统中的表示提供了必要补充。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表征分析过度依赖相似性，仅反映‘有什么’，却忽略‘结构是否可靠’。真实系统需具备抗扰动能力，因此需要一个新维度——几何稳定性，来评估表示结构在扰动下的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出并实现名为Shesha的框架，通过系统施加扰动并测量表征几何结构的保持程度，量化几何稳定性。采用多种数据集和模型配置进行跨域实验，结合统计相关性、敏感性分析与下游任务预测验证其有效性。

Result: 稳定性与相似性高度不相关（ρ≈0.01），二者机制不同；稳定性对细粒度流形结构敏感，不受主成分移除影响；在安全监控中比CKA更灵敏且抗误报；能有效预测线性可控性（ρ=0.89–0.96）；与迁移能力解耦，揭示迁移优化的几何成本；在生物系统中也表现出预测能力。

Conclusion: 几何稳定性是表征分析的关键补充，不仅揭示结构可靠性，还在安全、控制、模型选择及跨系统预测中提供实用价值，为理解计算与生物系统的表征机制开辟新路径。

Abstract: Analysis of learned representations has a blind spot: it focuses on $similarity$, measuring how closely embeddings align with external references, but similarity reveals only what is represented, not whether that structure is robust. We introduce $geometric$ $stability$, a distinct dimension that quantifies how reliably representational geometry holds under perturbation, and present $Shesha$, a framework for measuring it. Across 2,463 configurations in seven domains, we show that stability and similarity are empirically uncorrelated ($ρ\approx 0.01$) and mechanistically distinct: similarity metrics collapse after removing the top principal components, while stability retains sensitivity to fine-grained manifold structure. This distinction yields actionable insights: for safety monitoring, stability acts as a functional geometric canary, detecting structural drift nearly 2$\times$ more sensitively than CKA while filtering out the non-functional noise that triggers false alarms in rigid distance metrics; for controllability, supervised stability predicts linear steerability ($ρ= 0.89$-$0.96$); for model selection, stability dissociates from transferability, revealing a geometric tax that transfer optimization incurs. Beyond machine learning, stability predicts CRISPR perturbation coherence and neural-behavioral coupling. By quantifying $how$ $reliably$ systems maintain structure, geometric stability provides a necessary complement to similarity for auditing representations across biological and computational systems.

Method: $D^2Prune$ 采用双泰勒展开方法，联合建模权重与激活扰动，实现精准误差估计；并设计注意力感知的动态更新策略，通过最小化注意力分布的KL散度与重构误差，保留长尾注意力模式。

Conclusion: $D^2Prune$ 有效解决了现有剪枝方法在误差估计与注意力分布保留方面的不足，显著提升了大模型压缩效率与性能保持能力，具有良好的通用性与实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant deployment challenges due to their massive computational demands. % While pruning offers a promising compression solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: (1) They neglect activation distribution shifts between calibration data and test data, resulting in inaccurate error estimations; (2) They overlook the long-tail distribution characteristics of activations in the attention module. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel pruning method, $D^2Prune$. First, we propose a dual Taylor expansion-based method that jointly models weight and activation perturbations for precise error estimation, leading to precise pruning mask selection and weight updating and facilitating error minimization during pruning. % Second, we propose an attention-aware dynamic update strategy that preserves the long-tail attention pattern by jointly minimizing the KL divergence of attention distributions and the reconstruction error. Extensive experiments show that $D^2Prune$ consistently outperforms SOTA methods across various LLMs (e.g., OPT-125M, LLaMA2/3, and Qwen3). Moreover, the dynamic attention update mechanism also generalizes well to ViT-based vision models like DeiT, achieving superior accuracy on ImageNet-1K.

*Xinzi Tan,Kejian Zhang,Junhan Yu,Doudou Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多变量霍克斯过程理论的新型注意力机制——霍克斯注意力（Hawkes Attention），用于标记时间点过程（MTPP）。该方法通过可学习的每类型神经核来调制查询、键和值投影，取代传统注意力中的对应部分，从而统一事件时间与内容交互，学习时间相关行为和类型特异性激发模式。实验表明，该方法在性能上优于基线模型，并可扩展应用于时间序列预测等特定时序结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的方法主要依赖位置编码注入时间信息，且使用共享或参数化衰减结构，难以捕捉异质性和类型特异性的时间效应。

Method: 从多变量霍克斯过程理论出发，设计了一种新的注意力机制——霍克斯注意力，利用可学习的每类型神经核调制查询、键和值的投影，以更好地建模时间相关性与类型特异性激发模式。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在标记时间点过程任务中表现优于现有基线方法，同时可灵活应用于时间序列预测等具体时序建模场景。

Conclusion: 霍克斯注意力通过融合时间信息与内容交互，有效提升了对复杂时间动态的建模能力，为标记时间点过程提供了更强大的建模工具，并具有良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Marked Temporal Point Processes (MTPPs) arise naturally in medical, social, commercial, and financial domains. However, existing Transformer-based methods mostly inject temporal information only via positional encodings, relying on shared or parametric decay structures, which limits their ability to capture heterogeneous and type-specific temporal effects. Inspired by this observation, we derive a novel attention operator called Hawkes Attention from the multivariate Hawkes process theory for MTPP, using learnable per-type neural kernels to modulate query, key and value projections, thereby replacing the corresponding parts in the traditional attention. Benefited from the design, Hawkes Attention unifies event timing and content interaction, learning both the time-relevant behavior and type-specific excitation patterns from the data. The experimental results show that our method achieves better performance compared to the baselines. In addition to the general MTPP, our attention mechanism can also be easily applied to specific temporal structures, such as time series forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出GIFT（Gibbs Initialization with Finite Temperature），一种新型的后训练框架，旨在解决大推理模型（LRM）中监督微调（SFT）与强化学习（RL）之间的优化不匹配问题。传统SFT因严格监督导致分布坍缩，限制了后续RL的探索空间；而GIFT通过将监督视为有限温度的能量势，保留了基础先验，建立了从SFT到RL的分布一致性桥梁。实验表明，GIFT在RL初始化上显著优于标准SFT及其他基线方法，为实现后训练全局最优提供了数学上严谨的路径。

Motivation: 传统SFT与RL联合训练中存在优化不匹配：SFT的严格监督导致分布坍缩，压缩了后续强化学习所需的探索空间，影响模型性能。

Method: 将SFT重新建模为统一后训练框架的一部分，提出GIFT方法，通过引入有限温度能量势，避免零温极限下的分布坍缩，保持先验信息并促进目标一致性。

Abstract: The prevailing post-training paradigm for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs)--Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL)--suffers from an intrinsic optimization mismatch: the rigid supervision inherent in SFT induces distributional collapse, thereby exhausting the exploration space necessary for subsequent RL. In this paper, we reformulate SFT within a unified post-training framework and propose Gibbs Initialization with Finite Temperature (GIFT). We characterize standard SFT as a degenerate zero-temperature limit that suppresses base priors. Conversely, GIFT incorporates supervision as a finite-temperature energy potential, establishing a distributional bridge that ensures objective consistency throughout the post-training pipeline. Our experiments demonstrate that GIFT significantly outperforms standard SFT and other competitive baselines when utilized for RL initialization, providing a mathematically principled pathway toward achieving global optimality in post-training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习中的奖励设计是实际应用的主要瓶颈，而基于人类反馈的奖励学习虽有进展，但现有评分方法在效率和理论保证上仍有不足，因此需要一种更高效、更具理论保障的评分学习方法。

Method: R4采用一种新的排序均方误差（rMSE）损失，将轨迹的回报预测与教师评分进行软排序对齐，利用可微分排序算子处理评分数据，从轨迹-评分对数据集中学习奖励函数。

Abstract: Reward design remains a significant bottleneck in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to real-world problems. A popular alternative is reward learning, where reward functions are inferred from human feedback rather than manually specified. Recent work has proposed learning reward functions from human feedback in the form of ratings, rather than traditional binary preferences, enabling richer and potentially less cognitively demanding supervision. Building on this paradigm, we introduce a new rating-based RL method, Ranked Return Regression for RL (R4). At its core, R4 employs a novel ranking mean squared error (rMSE) loss, which treats teacher-provided ratings as ordinal targets. Our approach learns from a dataset of trajectory-rating pairs, where each trajectory is labeled with a discrete rating (e.g., "bad," "neutral," "good"). At each training step, we sample a set of trajectories, predict their returns, and rank them using a differentiable sorting operator (soft ranks). We then optimize a mean squared error loss between the resulting soft ranks and the teacher's ratings. Unlike prior rating-based approaches, R4 offers formal guarantees: its solution set is provably minimal and complete under mild assumptions. Empirically, using simulated human feedback, we demonstrate that R4 consistently matches or outperforms existing rating and preference-based RL methods on robotic locomotion benchmarks from OpenAI Gym and the DeepMind Control Suite, while requiring significantly less feedback.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: XLinear 是一种基于 MLP 的轻量级时间序列预测模型，通过全局令牌与外生变量交互，利用 sigmoid 激活函数提取时序模式和变量间依赖关系，在多个基准和真实数据集上展现出优于现有模型的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中存在不对称因果关系和不同数据获取成本，传统模型假设变量重要性均匀，难以有效利用低成本外生数据（如局部天气）对内生变量（如湖面温度）的影响，因此需要更高效且能捕捉此类关系的模型。

Result: 在七个标准基准和五个真实世界数据集上，XLinear 在多变量和受外生变量影响的单变量预测任务中均表现出更高的准确率和计算效率，优于当前最先进的模型。

Conclusion: XLinear 通过轻量化设计有效利用了外生变量中的信息，尤其适用于外生输入成本低但影响显著的场景，为长时序预测提供了高效、精准的新解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the prevalent assumption of uniform variable importance in long-term time series forecasting models, real world applications often exhibit asymmetric causal relationships and varying data acquisition costs. Specifically, cost-effective exogenous data (e.g., local weather) can unilaterally influence dynamics of endogenous variables, such as lake surface temperature. Exploiting these links enables more effective forecasts when exogenous inputs are readily available. Transformer-based models capture long-range dependencies but incur high computation and suffer from permutation invariance. Patch-based variants improve efficiency yet can miss local temporal patterns. To efficiently exploit informative signals across both the temporal dimension and relevant exogenous variables, this study proposes XLinear, a lightweight time series forecasting model built upon MultiLayer Perceptrons (MLPs). XLinear uses a global token derived from an endogenous variable as a pivotal hub for interacting with exogenous variables, and employs MLPs with sigmoid activation to extract both temporal patterns and variate-wise dependencies. Its prediction head then integrates these signals to forecast the endogenous series. We evaluate XLinear on seven standard benchmarks and five real-world datasets with exogenous inputs. Compared with state-of-the-art models, XLinear delivers superior accuracy and efficiency for both multivariate forecasts and univariate forecasts influenced by exogenous inputs.

Conclusion: RIFT是一种高效、稳健的LLM对齐方法，能够充分利用自生成数据，克服现有方法的数据浪费与训练不稳问题。

Abstract: While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT) are standard for LLM alignment, they either rely on costly expert data or discard valuable negative samples, leading to data inefficiency. To address this, we propose Reward Informed Fine-Tuning (RIFT), a simple yet effective framework that utilizes all self-generated samples. Unlike the hard thresholding of RFT, RIFT repurposes negative trajectories, reweighting the loss with scalar rewards to learn from both the positive and negative trajectories from the model outputs. To overcome the training collapse caused by naive reward integration, where direct multiplication yields an unbounded loss, we introduce a stabilized loss formulation that ensures numerical robustness and optimization efficiency. Extensive experiments on mathematical benchmarks across various base models show that RIFT consistently outperforms RFT. Our results demonstrate that RIFT is a robust and data-efficient alternative for alignment using mixed-quality, self-generated data.

TL;DR: 本文研究在不可观测反馈可靠性下的学习问题（EIUR），提出元认知调控作为解决方案，通过内生证据推断经验可信度，设计了MTR框架与自诊断机制，实现无需外部标签或显式污染模型的内在可靠性评估。实验表明，该方法能提升认知可识别性，在强化学习中实现校准的怀疑态度和恢复能力，在监督学习中揭示性能恢复不等于认知恢复的深层问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不可观测反馈可靠性下，系统不仅需稳定学习，还需判断是否应信任某次经验；传统鲁棒学习可能收敛但形成高置信度的系统性错误信念，因此需要新的机制来识别和应对不可观测的可靠性问题。

Method: 提出元认知调控，构建模块化MTR（Monitor-Trust-Regulator）框架，采用自诊断机制，通过缓慢变化的信任变量软调节学习更新，基于内部动态的内生证据进行可信度推断，无需外源标签或显式污染模型。

Result: 在EIUR设定下，自诊断显著提升认知可识别性；强化学习中实现对系统性错误奖励的校准怀疑与恢复；监督学习中发现性能恢复不等于认知恢复，早期误导数据仍可导致内部信念固化，仅通过内省诊断可检测此问题。

Conclusion: MTR框架与自诊断机制为自主学习中不可观测可靠性提供了组织性抽象与具体设计模板，支持内在可靠性评估，是迈向可信自主学习的关键步骤。

Abstract: Learning under unobservable feedback reliability poses a distinct challenge beyond optimization robustness: a system must decide whether to learn from an experience, not only how to learn stably. We study this setting as Epistemic Identifiability under Unobservable Reliability (EIUR), where each experience has a latent credibility, reliable and unreliable feedback can be locally indistinguishable, and data are generated in a closed loop by the learner's own evolving beliefs and actions. In EIUR, standard robust learning can converge stably yet form high-confidence, systematically wrong beliefs.
  We propose metacognitive regulation as a practical response: a second, introspective control loop that infers experience credibility from endogenous evidence in the learner's internal dynamics. We formalize this as a modular Monitor-Trust-Regulator (MTR) decomposition and instantiate it with self-diagnosis, which maintains a slowly varying experience-trust variable that softly modulates learning updates, without exogenous reliability labels or an explicit corruption model.
  Empirically, in the EIUR regimes studied here, self-diagnosis is associated with improved epistemic identifiability. In reinforcement learning, it enables calibrated skepticism and recovery under systematically corrupted rewards. In supervised learning, it exposes a critical dissociation: performance recovery does not imply epistemic recovery. Accuracy can rebound while internal belief dynamics remain locked-in by early misleading data, a failure detectable only through introspective diagnostics. Together, MTR and self-diagnosis provide an organizing abstraction and a concrete design template for intrinsic reliability assessment in autonomous learning under unobservable reliability.

TL;DR: MOF-LLM is the first LLM framework for block-level MOF structure prediction, using spatial-aware continual pre-training, structural supervised fine-tuning, and matching-driven reinforcement learning with SAPO to improve spatial reasoning and structural accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately predicting 3D structures of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is challenging due to their high atomic complexity, and existing LLM approaches are limited in handling such complexity; this work aims to overcome these limitations by leveraging modular assembly through a specialized LLM framework.

Method: MOF-LLM employs a training paradigm combining spatial-aware continual pre-training (CPT), structural supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and matching-driven reinforcement learning (RL) with Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO) to enhance spatial reasoning and structural stability.

Result: MOF-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art denoising-based and LLM-based methods in accuracy and sampling efficiency, demonstrating superior performance in predicting MOF structures.

Conclusion: The proposed MOF-LLM framework significantly advances the application of LLMs in complex materials design by enabling accurate, efficient, and structurally stable prediction of MOF architectures through block-level modular generation.

Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous crystalline materials with broad applications such as carbon capture and drug delivery, yet accurately predicting their 3D structures remains a significant challenge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating crystals, their application to MOFs is hindered by MOFs' high atomic complexity. Inspired by the success of block-wise paradigms in deep generative models, we pioneer the use of LLMs in this domain by introducing MOF-LLM, the first LLM framework specifically adapted for block-level MOF structure prediction. To effectively harness LLMs for this modular assembly task, our training paradigm integrates spatial-aware continual pre-training (CPT), structural supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and matching-driven reinforcement learning (RL). By incorporating explicit spatial priors and optimizing structural stability via Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), our approach substantially enhances the spatial reasoning capability of a Qwen-3 8B model for accurate MOF structure prediction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MOF-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art denoising-based and LLM-based methods while exhibiting superior sampling efficiency.

Conclusion: DC-CFL 是一种高效、实用的单轮聚类联邦学习方案，适合在通信受限条件下进行协同人工智能模型开发。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed learning across multiple clients without sharing raw data. When statistical heterogeneity across clients is severe, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) can improve performance by grouping similar clients and training cluster-wise models. However, most CFL approaches rely on multiple communication rounds for cluster estimation and model updates, which limits their practicality under tight constraints on communication rounds. We propose Data Collaboration-based Clustered Federated Learning (DC-CFL), a single-round framework that completes both client clustering and cluster-wise learning, using only the information shared in DC analysis. DC-CFL quantifies inter-client similarity via total variation distance between label distributions, estimates clusters using hierarchical clustering, and performs cluster-wise learning via DC analysis. Experiments on multiple open datasets under representative non-IID conditions show that DC-CFL achieves accuracy comparable to multi-round baselines while requiring only one communication round. These results indicate that DC-CFL is a practical alternative for collaborative AI model development when multiple communication rounds are impractical.

Motivation: 现有参数高效方法如PiSSA和MiLoRA适用于监督微调（SFT），不适应RLVR的独特优化动态和几何结构，直接应用会导致谱崩溃和优化不稳定；而基于更新稀疏性的方法在现代硬件上因非结构化计算存在效率瓶颈。

Conclusion: GeoRA通过几何感知的低秩适配策略，成功解决了RLVR中参数高效方法的几何不匹配与计算效率问题，为大规模推理模型的强化学习提供了高效、稳定且可扩展的新范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is crucial for advancing large-scale reasoning models. However, existing parameter-efficient methods, such as PiSSA and MiLoRA, are designed for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and do not account for the distinct optimization dynamics and geometric structures of RLVR. Applying these methods directly leads to spectral collapse and optimization instability, which severely limit model performance. Meanwhile, alternative approaches that leverage update sparsity encounter significant efficiency bottlenecks on modern hardware due to unstructured computations. To address these challenges, we propose GeoRA (Geometry-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation), which exploits the anisotropic and compressible nature of RL update subspaces. GeoRA initializes adapters by extracting principal directions via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) within a geometrically constrained subspace while freezing the residual components. This method preserves the pre-trained geometric structure and enables efficient GPU computation through dense operators. Experiments on Qwen and Llama demonstrate that GeoRA mitigates optimization bottlenecks caused by geometric misalignment. It consistently outperforms established low-rank baselines on key mathematical benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. Moreover, GeoRA shows superior generalization and resilience to catastrophic forgetting in out-of-domain tasks.

Abstract: We introduce a new method of generating Computer Aided Design (CAD) profiles via a sequence of simple geometric constructions including curve offsetting, rotations and intersections. These sequences start with geometry provided by a designer and build up the points and curves of the final profile step by step. We demonstrate that adding construction steps between the designer's input geometry and the final profile improves generation quality in a similar way to the introduction of a chain of thought in language models. Similar to the constraints in a parametric CAD model, the construction sequences reduce the degrees of freedom in the modeled shape to a small set of parameter values which can be adjusted by the designer, allowing parametric editing with the constructed geometry evaluated to floating point precision. In addition we show that applying reinforcement learning to the construction sequences gives further improvements over a wide range of metrics, including some which were not explicitly optimized.

Abstract: Providing clear explanations to the choices of machine learning models is essential for these models to be deployed in crucial applications. Counterfactual and semi-factual explanations have emerged as two mechanisms for providing users with insights into the outputs of their models. We provide an overview of the computational complexity results in the literature for generating these explanations, finding that in many cases, generating explanations is computationally hard. We strengthen the argument for this considerably by further contributing our own inapproximability results showing that not only are explanations often hard to generate, but under certain assumptions, they are also hard to approximate. We discuss the implications of these complexity results for the XAI community and for policymakers seeking to regulate explanations in AI.

Result: YanTian模型在精度上超越欧洲中期天气预报中心高分辨率版本，在1°分辨率下媲美顶尖AI模型，计算成本仅为标准自回归方法的1/200，Z500预报有效提前期达10.3天，优于HRES的9天。

Conclusion: 该工作为复杂全球尺度地球系统过程的预测建模提供了坚实的算法基础，推动了地球系统科学的发展。

Abstract: Accurate global medium-range weather forecasting is fundamental to Earth system science. Most existing Transformer-based forecasting models adopt vision-centric architectures that neglect the Earth's spherical geometry and zonal periodicity. In addition, conventional autoregressive training is computationally expensive and limits forecast horizons due to error accumulation. To address these challenges, we propose the Shifted Earth Transformer (Searth Transformer), a physics-informed architecture that incorporates zonal periodicity and meridional boundaries into window-based self-attention for physically consistent global information exchange. We further introduce a Relay Autoregressive (RAR) fine-tuning strategy that enables learning long-range atmospheric evolution under constrained memory and computational budgets. Based on these methods, we develop YanTian, a global medium-range weather forecasting model. YanTian achieves higher accuracy than the high-resolution forecast of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and performs competitively with state-of-the-art AI models at one-degree resolution, while requiring roughly 200 times lower computational cost than standard autoregressive fine-tuning. Furthermore, YanTian attains a longer skillful forecast lead time for Z500 (10.3 days) than HRES (9 days). Beyond weather forecasting, this work establishes a robust algorithmic foundation for predictive modeling of complex global-scale geophysical circulation systems, offering new pathways for Earth system science.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairGU is a fairness-aware graph unlearning framework that addresses the issue of insufficient protection for sensitive attributes in existing methods, ensuring both utility and fairness during node removal. It integrates a fairness-aware module and data protection strategies, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets in accuracy and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph unlearning techniques fail to adequately protect sensitive attributes, leading to reduced algorithmic fairness compared to traditional graph learning methods.

Method: FairGU incorporates a fairness-aware module and effective data protection strategies to prevent amplification or structural exposure of sensitive attributes during unlearning.

Result: Extensive experiments show FairGU consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph unlearning and fairness-enhanced graph learning methods in both accuracy and fairness metrics.

Conclusion: FairGU mitigates previously overlooked risks in current unlearning practices and provides a robust, equitable solution for socially sustainable networked systems.

Abstract: Graph unlearning has emerged as a critical mechanism for supporting sustainable and privacy-preserving social networks, enabling models to remove the influence of deleted nodes and thereby better safeguard user information. However, we observe that existing graph unlearning techniques insufficiently protect sensitive attributes, often leading to degraded algorithmic fairness compared with traditional graph learning methods. To address this gap, we introduce FairGU, a fairness-aware graph unlearning framework designed to preserve both utility and fairness during the unlearning process. FairGU integrates a dedicated fairness-aware module with effective data protection strategies, ensuring that sensitive attributes are neither inadvertently amplified nor structurally exposed when nodes are removed. Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, we demonstrate that FairGU consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph unlearning methods and fairness-enhanced graph learning baselines in terms of both accuracy and fairness metrics. Our findings highlight a previously overlooked risk in current unlearning practices and establish FairGU as a robust and equitable solution for the next generation of socially sustainable networked systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为\simmerge{}的预测性模型合并选择方法，利用少量无标签探测样本计算功能和结构特征，通过任务无关的相似性信号预测两路合并性能，从而在无需昂贵的合并-评估循环的情况下，自动选择最优合并算子、模型子集和合并顺序。该方法在7B和111B参数规模的LLM上均表现优异，并支持多路合并与动态扩展，适用于大规模检查点目录和有限评估预算场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型合并需要大量昂贵的合并-评估搜索来确定最佳合并策略，而\simmerge{}旨在通过低成本的相似性信号预测性能，避免重复评估，提升合并效率。

Method: 基于少量无标签探测样本，提取模型的功能和结构特征，构建任务无关的相似性信号，使用这些信号预测2路合并的性能，并据此选择最优合并方案。此外还提出了支持动态添加任务、模型和算子的带状变体。

Conclusion: \simmerge{}为大规模模型组合提供了一条实用且可扩展的路径，尤其适用于检查点数量庞大且评估资源受限的场景。

Abstract: Model merging enables multiple large language models (LLMs) to be combined into a single model while preserving performance. This makes it a valuable tool in LLM development, offering a competitive alternative to multi-task training. However, merging can be difficult at scale, as successful merging requires choosing the right merge operator, selecting the right models, and merging them in the right order. This often leads researchers to run expensive merge-and-evaluate searches to select the best merge. In this work, we provide an alternative by introducing \simmerge{}, \emph{a predictive merge-selection method} that selects the best merge using inexpensive, task-agnostic similarity signals between models. From a small set of unlabeled probes, we compute functional and structural features and use them to predict the performance of a given 2-way merge. Using these predictions, \simmerge{} selects the best merge operator, the subset of models to merge, and the merge order, eliminating the expensive merge-and-evaluate loop. We demonstrate that we surpass standard merge-operator performance on 2-way merges of 7B-parameter LLMs, and that \simmerge{} generalizes to multi-way merges and 111B-parameter LLM merges without retraining. Additionally, we present a bandit variant that supports adding new tasks, models, and operators on the fly. Our results suggest that learning how to merge is a practical route to scalable model composition when checkpoint catalogs are large and evaluation budgets are tight.

*Weiguo Gao,Ming Li,Qianxiao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TOCFlow 提出一种基于最优控制的框架，用于在预训练的流模型中对终端约束分布进行采样。通过哈密顿-雅可比-贝尔曼方程刻画价值函数，推导出最小化哈密顿量的最优反馈控制。随着控制惩罚增大，过程恢复参考分布；惩罚趋近于零时，终端分布收敛至广义 Wasserstein 投影。算法上，引入几何感知的采样时间引导方法，在共动坐标系中求解控制问题，得到闭式标量阻尼因子，捕捉黎曼梯度的二阶曲率效应而无需矩阵求逆，计算成本与标准梯度引导相当。在高维科学任务（如达西流、轨迹规划、湍流快照生成）中，TOCFlow 在满足约束方面优于欧氏引导和投影基线，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流模型难以有效处理具有复杂终端约束的采样任务，尤其是当约束涉及等式、不等式或全局统计性质时。传统方法依赖于欧氏空间中的梯度引导或简单投影，缺乏对数据流形几何结构的感知，导致约束满足性差或生成质量下降。因此需要一种能兼顾几何一致性与高效计算的新方法。

Method: 提出终端最优控制框架（TOCFlow），将采样问题建模为最优控制问题。在终端共动坐标系中求解控制问题，利用黎曼梯度并引入闭式标量阻尼因子以捕获二阶曲率信息，避免矩阵求逆，实现几何一致性的采样引导。

Result: 在三个高维科学任务（Darcy flow、约束轨迹规划、湍流快照生成）中，TOCFlow 显著提升约束满足度，优于欧氏引导和投影基线方法，同时保持原始生成模型的高质量生成能力。

Conclusion: TOCFlow 通过最优控制视角实现了对终端约束分布的有效采样，兼具几何感知与高效计算优势，为复杂约束下的生成建模提供了新范式。

Abstract: We address the problem of sampling from terminally constrained distributions with pre-trained flow-based generative models through an optimal control formulation. Theoretically, we characterize the value function by a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and derive the optimal feedback control as the minimizer of the associated Hamiltonian. We show that as the control penalty increases, the controlled process recovers the reference distribution, while as the penalty vanishes, the terminal law converges to a generalized Wasserstein projection onto the constraint manifold. Algorithmically, we introduce Terminal Optimal Control with Flow-based models (TOCFlow), a geometry-aware sampling-time guidance method for pre-trained flows. Solving the control problem in a terminal co-moving frame that tracks reference trajectories yields a closed-form scalar damping factor along the Riemannian gradient, capturing second-order curvature effects without matrix inversions. TOCFlow therefore matches the geometric consistency of Gauss-Newton updates at the computational cost of standard gradient guidance. We evaluate TOCFlow on three high-dimensional scientific tasks spanning equality, inequality, and global statistical constraints, namely Darcy flow, constrained trajectory planning, and turbulence snapshot generation with Kolmogorov spectral scaling. Across all settings, TOCFlow improves constraint satisfaction over Euclidean guidance and projection baselines while preserving the reference model's generative quality.

Abstract: Kernel-based methods are used in the context of Granger Causality to enable the identification of nonlinear causal relationships between time series variables. In this paper, we show that two state of the art kernel-based Granger Causality (GC) approaches can be theoretically unified under the framework of Kernel Principal Component Regression (KPCR), and introduce a method based on this unification, demonstrating that this approach can improve causal identification. Additionally, we introduce a Gaussian Process score-based model with Smooth Information Criterion penalisation on the marginal likelihood, and demonstrate improved performance over existing state of the art time-series nonlinear causal discovery methods. Furthermore, we propose a contemporaneous causal identification algorithm, fully based on GC, using the proposed score-based $GP_{SIC}$ method, and compare its performance to a state of the art contemporaneous time series causal discovery algorithm.

Conclusion: 所提出的训练框架通过重塑损失景观的几何结构，显著提升了单头循环Transformer的训练稳定性与性能，为理解其推理机制提供了新视角，具有重要的理论与应用价值。

Abstract: Recent research suggests that looped Transformers have superior reasoning capabilities compared to standard deep architectures. Current approaches to training single-head looped architectures on benchmark tasks frequently fail or yield suboptimal performance due to a highly non-convex and irregular loss landscape. In these settings, optimization often stagnates in poor local minima and saddle points of the loss landscape, preventing the model from discovering the global minimum point. The internal mechanisms of these single-head looped transformer models remain poorly understood, and training them from scratch remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework that leverages Tsallis entropy and Hamiltonian dynamics to transform the geometry of the loss landscape. By treating the parameter updates as a physical flow, we successfully trained a single-head looped Transformer with model dimension $d = 8$ to solve induction head task with input sequence length of 1000 tokens. This success reveals the internal mechanism behind the superior reasoning capability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CUD（Circuit-guided Unlearning Difficulty）的预学习难度度量方法，用于在机器遗忘过程中预测每个样本的难易程度。该方法基于模型电路（model circuits）——即决定预测形成的结构化交互路径——从机制层面分析遗忘难度。实验表明，CUD能够有效区分内在容易与困难的样本，并且在不同遗忘方法下保持稳定。研究发现，容易遗忘的样本通常涉及较短、较浅的路径，集中在模型早期到中期阶段；而难以遗忘的样本则依赖于更长、更深的路径，靠近后期计算阶段。相比现有定性研究，CUD为遗忘难度提供了首个系统性、细粒度和可解释的分析框架，推动了基于模型机制的遗忘方法的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器遗忘在语言模型中面临显著的样本间差异：某些样本能被可靠擦除，而另一些即使采用相同方法仍会残留记忆。这种差异不仅源于数据本身，也反映了模型内部机制对记忆信息的编码与保护。因此，亟需一种机制性的理解来揭示遗忘难度的本质，从而指导更有效的遗忘方法设计。

Method: 提出基于模型电路的预学习度量指标CUD，利用电路级信号对每个样本进行连续难度评分。通过分析模型内部结构化交互路径的长度、深度及分布位置，识别影响遗忘难易的关键机制特征。

Result: CUD在多种遗忘方法下均表现出良好的稳定性，能准确区分容易与困难样本。实验揭示了机械性模式：易忘样本路径短、浅，集中于早期至中期计算；难忘样本路径长、深，位于后期计算阶段。该指标实现了对遗忘难度的细粒度、可解释评估。

Conclusion: CUD为理解机器遗忘中的难度差异提供了机制性视角，是迈向基于模型内部机制设计高效遗忘方法的重要一步。其可解释性和稳定性为未来可信赖的语言模型构建提供了新工具。

Abstract: Machine unlearning is becoming essential for building trustworthy and compliant language models. Yet unlearning success varies considerably across individual samples: some are reliably erased, while others persist despite the same procedure. We argue that this disparity is not only a data-side phenomenon, but also reflects model-internal mechanisms that encode and protect memorized information. We study this problem from a mechanistic perspective based on model circuits--structured interaction pathways that govern how predictions are formed. We propose Circuit-guided Unlearning Difficulty (CUD), a {\em pre-unlearning} metric that assigns each sample a continuous difficulty score using circuit-level signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CUD reliably separates intrinsically easy and hard samples, and remains stable across unlearning methods. We identify key circuit-level patterns that reveal a mechanistic signature of difficulty: easy-to-unlearn samples are associated with shorter, shallower interactions concentrated in earlier-to-intermediate parts of the original model, whereas hard samples rely on longer and deeper pathways closer to late-stage computation. Compared to existing qualitative studies, CUD takes a first step toward a principled, fine-grained, and interpretable analysis of unlearning difficulty; and motivates the development of unlearning methods grounded in model mechanisms.

*Ge Lei,Ferran Brosa Planella,Sterling G. Baird,Samuel J. Cooper*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs enable efficient, high-performing battery charging protocol optimization via gradient-free, closed-loop methods: P2O generates neural-network protocols via LLM suggestions and inner-loop training, while P2P directly writes explicit charging functions. Both outperform traditional methods and achieve ~4.2% improvement in battery health under fast charging, expanding search space and enabling language-based constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing battery charging protocol optimization is hindered by slow, costly, and non-differentiable evaluations. Conventional methods restrict the search space, limiting discovery of better-performing protocols.

Method: Two LLM-driven, gradient-free closed-loop methods: Prompt-to-Optimizer (P2O) uses an LLM to generate code for small neural networks, trained in an inner loop; Prompt-to-Protocol (P2P) directly generates explicit charging functions with scalar parameters.

Result: P2O surpasses Bayesian optimization, evolutionary algorithms, and random search in performance. Both P2O and P2P improve capacity retention by ~4.2% over a state-of-the-art multi-step constant current baseline under equivalent evaluation budgets.

Conclusion: LLMs can significantly expand the functional form space for charging protocols, incorporate language-based constraints, and enable efficient optimization in expensive experimental settings.

Abstract: Efficiently optimizing battery charging protocols is challenging because each evaluation is slow, costly, and non-differentiable. Many existing approaches address this difficulty by heavily constraining the protocol search space, which limits the diversity of protocols that can be explored, preventing the discovery of higher-performing solutions. We introduce two gradient-free, LLM-driven closed-loop methods: Prompt-to-Optimizer (P2O), which uses an LLM to propose the code for small neural-network-based protocols, which are then trained by an inner loop, and Prompt-to-Protocol (P2P), which simply writes an explicit function for the current and its scalar parameters. Across our case studies, LLM-guided P2O outperforms neural networks designed by Bayesian optimization, evolutionary algorithms, and random search. In a realistic fast charging scenario, both P2O and P2P yield around a 4.2 percent improvement in state of health (capacity retention based health metric under fast charging cycling) over a state-of-the-art multi-step constant current (CC) baseline, with P2P achieving this under matched evaluation budgets (same number of protocol evaluations). These results demonstrate that LLMs can expand the space of protocol functional forms, incorporate language-based constraints, and enable efficient optimization in high cost experimental settings.

Abstract: Tabular Foundation Models (TFMs) have recently shown strong in-context learning capabilities on structured data, achieving zero-shot performance comparable to traditional machine learning methods. We find that zero-shot TFMs already achieve strong performance, while the benefits of fine-tuning are highly model and data-dependent. Meta-learning and PEFT provide moderate gains under specific conditions, whereas full supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often reduces accuracy or calibration quality. This work presents the first comprehensive study of fine-tuning in TFMs across benchmarks including TALENT, OpenML-CC18, and TabZilla. We compare Zero-Shot, Meta-Learning, Supervised (SFT), and parameter-efficient (PEFT) approaches, analyzing how dataset factors such as imbalance, size, and dimensionality affect outcomes. Our findings cover performance, calibration, and fairness, offering practical guidelines on when fine-tuning is most beneficial and its limitations.

Motivation: 多任务学习结合低秩适配（LoRA）虽能降低存储开销，但因不同任务间梯度冲突导致性能下降，尤其在低秩约束下优化能力受限，亟需解决任务干扰问题。

Method: 提出Ortho-LoRA，利用LoRA的内在双分图结构，动态将任务间的冲突梯度投影至彼此的正交补空间，从而减少干扰。

Result: 在GLUE基准上，Ortho-LoRA有效缓解了任务干扰，优于标准联合训练，并恢复了95%的单任务与多任务基线之间的性能差距，计算开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: Ortho-LoRA是一种高效、轻量的多任务学习优化方法，能够显著提升LoRA在多任务场景下的表现，为大模型参数高效部署提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) combined with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a promising direction for parameter-efficient deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). By sharing a single adapter across multiple tasks, one can significantly reduce storage overhead. However, this approach suffers from negative transfer, where conflicting gradient updates from distinct tasks degrade the performance of individual tasks compared to single-task fine-tuning. This problem is exacerbated in LoRA due to the low-rank constraint, which limits the optimization landscape's capacity to accommodate diverse task requirements. In this paper, we propose Ortho-LoRA, a gradient projection method specifically tailored for the bipartite structure of LoRA. Ortho-LoRA dynamically projects conflicting task gradients onto the orthogonal complement of each other within the intrinsic LoRA subspace. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark demonstrate that Ortho-LoRA effectively mitigates task interference, outperforming standard joint training and recovering 95\% of the performance gap between multi-task and single-task baselines with negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: 统一的结构-配体训练具有显著优势，ConGLUDe为药物发现中的通用基础模型发展迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Structure-based and ligand-based computational drug design have traditionally relied on disjoint data sources and modeling assumptions, limiting their joint use at scale. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Geometric Learning for Unified Computational Drug Design (ConGLUDe), a single contrastive geometric model that unifies structure- and ligand-based training. ConGLUDe couples a geometric protein encoder that produces whole-protein representations and implicit embeddings of predicted binding sites with a fast ligand encoder, removing the need for pre-defined pockets. By aligning ligands with both global protein representations and multiple candidate binding sites through contrastive learning, ConGLUDe supports ligand-conditioned pocket prediction in addition to virtual screening and target fishing, while being trained jointly on protein-ligand complexes and large-scale bioactivity data. Across diverse benchmarks, ConGLUDe achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot virtual screening performance in settings where no binding pocket information is provided as input, substantially outperforms existing methods on a challenging target fishing task, and demonstrates competitive ligand-conditioned pocket selection. These results highlight the advantages of unified structure-ligand training and position ConGLUDe as a step toward general-purpose foundation models for drug discovery.

Abstract: In educational applications, LLMs exhibit several fundamental pedagogical limitations, such as their tendency to reveal solutions rather than support dialogic learning. We introduce ConvoLearn (https://huggingface.co/datasets/masharma/convolearn ), a dataset grounded in knowledge building theory that operationalizes six core pedagogical dimensions: cognitive engagement, formative assessment, accountability, cultural responsiveness, metacognition, and power dynamics. We construct a semi-synthetic dataset of 1250 tutor-student dialogues (20 turns each) in middle school Earth Science through controlled interactions between human teachers and a simulated student. Using QLoRA, we demonstrate that training on this dataset meaningfully shifts LLM behavior toward knowledge-building strategies. Human evaluation by 31 teachers shows our fine-tuned Mistral 7B (M = 4.10, SD = 1.03) significantly outperforms both its base version (M = 2.59, SD = 1.11) and Claude Sonnet 4.5 (M = 2.87, SD = 1.29) overall. This work establishes a potential framework to guide future development and evaluation of constructivist AI tutors.

*Derrick Goh Xin Deik,Quanyu Long,Zhengyuan Liu,Nancy F. Chen,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SCOPE提出一种新的多约束规划框架，通过分离推理与代码执行，实现可扩展、一致且可复用的求解器函数生成。相比现有方法，其在性能、成本和延迟上均有显著提升，例如在TravelPlanner任务中，使用GPT-4o达到93.1%的成功率，较最佳基线提升61.6%，同时降低1.4倍推理成本并减少约4.67倍时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在多约束规划中面临根本性挑战：纯推理范式易产生不一致、错误累积且成本高昂；而结合编码或求解器的方法缺乏灵活性，通常需为特定问题生成新代码或依赖固定求解器，难以捕捉跨问题的通用逻辑。

Method: 提出SCOPE框架，将查询相关的推理与通用代码执行相分离，生成仅需微调输入参数即可复用的确定性求解器函数，从而实现高效、一致且可扩展的规划。

Result: 在TravelPlanner等任务上，使用GPT-4o时达到93.1%成功率，相较最佳基线（CoT）提升61.6%，推理成本降低1.4倍，推理时间减少约4.67倍，展现出显著优于现有方法的性能与效率。

Conclusion: SCOPE通过解耦推理与执行，实现了高效、一致、可复用的多约束规划解决方案，在保持高成功率的同时大幅降低计算开销，为复杂规划任务提供了可扩展的新范式。

Abstract: Multi-constraint planning involves identifying, evaluating, and refining candidate plans while satisfying multiple, potentially conflicting constraints. Existing large language model (LLM) approaches face fundamental limitations in this domain. Pure reasoning paradigms, which rely on long natural language chains, are prone to inconsistency, error accumulation, and prohibitive cost as constraints compound. Conversely, LLMs combined with coding- or solver-based strategies lack flexibility: they often generate problem-specific code from scratch or depend on fixed solvers, failing to capture generalizable logic across diverse problems. To address these challenges, we introduce the Scalable COde Planning Engine (SCOPE), a framework that disentangles query-specific reasoning from generic code execution. By separating reasoning from execution, SCOPE produces solver functions that are consistent, deterministic, and reusable across queries while requiring only minimal changes to input parameters. SCOPE achieves state-of-the-art performance while lowering cost and latency. For example, with GPT-4o, it reaches 93.1% success on TravelPlanner, a 61.6% gain over the best baseline (CoT) while cutting inference cost by 1.4x and time by ~4.67x.

Conclusion: 本研究是最早将大语言模型应用于动态作业车间调度的工作之一，证明了其在智能、自适应调度优化中的巨大潜力，为未来智能制造中的动态调度提供了新思路。

Abstract: Production scheduling is highly susceptible to dynamic disruptions, such as variations in processing times, machine availability, and unexpected task insertions. Conventional approaches typically rely on event-specific models and explicit analytical formulations, which limits their adaptability and generalization across previously unseen disturbances. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes DScheLLM, a dynamic scheduling approach that leverages fine-tuned large language models within a dual-system (fast-slow) reasoning architecture to address disturbances of different scales. A unified large language model-based framework is constructed to handle dynamic events, where training datasets for both fast and slow reasoning modes are generated using exact schedules obtained from an operations research solver. The Huawei OpenPangu Embedded-7B model is subsequently fine-tuned under the hybrid reasoning paradigms using LoRA. Experimental evaluations on standard job shop scheduling benchmarks demonstrate that the fast-thinking mode can efficiently generate high-quality schedules and the slow-thinking mode can produce solver-compatible and well-formatted decision inputs. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents one of the earliest studies applying large language models to job shop scheduling in dynamic environments, highlighting their considerable potential for intelligent and adaptive scheduling optimization.

Abstract: High-quality chain-of-thought has demonstrated strong potential for unlocking the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, current paradigms typically treat the reasoning process as an indivisible sequence, lacking an intrinsic mechanism to quantify step-wise information gain. This granularity gap manifests in two limitations: inference inefficiency from redundant exploration without explicit guidance, and optimization difficulty due to sparse outcome supervision or costly external verifiers. In this work, we propose CoT-Flow, a framework that reconceptualizes discrete reasoning steps as a continuous probabilistic flow, quantifying the contribution of each step toward the ground-truth answer. Built on this formulation, CoT-Flow enables two complementary methodologies: flow-guided decoding, which employs a greedy flow-based decoding strategy to extract information-efficient reasoning paths, and flow-based reinforcement learning, which constructs a verifier-free dense reward function. Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that CoT-Flow achieves a superior balance between inference efficiency and reasoning performance.

Abstract: Effective pandemic control requires timely and coordinated policymaking across administrative regions that are intrinsically interdependent. However, human-driven responses are often fragmented and reactive, with policies formulated in isolation and adjusted only after outbreaks escalate, undermining proactive intervention and global pandemic mitigation. To address this challenge, here we propose a large language model (LLM) multi-agent policymaking framework that supports coordinated and proactive pandemic control across regions. Within our framework, each administrative region is assigned an LLM agent as an AI policymaking assistant. The agent reasons over region-specific epidemiological dynamics while communicating with other agents to account for cross-regional interdependencies. By integrating real-world data, a pandemic evolution simulator, and structured inter-agent communication, our framework enables agents to jointly explore counterfactual intervention scenarios and synthesize coordinated policy decisions through a closed-loop simulation process. We validate the proposed framework using state-level COVID-19 data from the United States between April and December 2020, together with real-world mobility records and observed policy interventions. Compared with real-world pandemic outcomes, our approach reduces cumulative infections and deaths by up to 63.7% and 40.1%, respectively, at the individual state level, and by 39.0% and 27.0%, respectively, when aggregated across states. These results demonstrate that LLM multi-agent systems can enable more effective pandemic control with coordinated policymaking...

TL;DR: RISER 是一种基于路由器的可调节推理增强框架，通过动态组合可重用的推理向量，在激活空间中自适应地引导大语言模型的推理过程。该方法利用强化学习优化轻量级路由器，以任务级奖励为指导，实现对潜在认知原语的涌现式、组合式激活。在七个不同基准测试中，RISER 在零样本设置下平均提升3.4-6.5%的准确率，且相比传统的思维链（CoT）方法在2-3倍更高的令牌效率下仍保持更强的准确率增益。分析表明，RISER 能自主组合多个向量，形成可解释、精确的控制策略，推动更可控、高效的模型推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有领域特定推理方法多依赖训练密集型参数更新，而激活引导虽为参数高效替代方案，但普遍采用静态、手动干预，难以适应复杂推理的动态需求。因此亟需一种能自适应调整、高效灵活的推理增强机制。

Method: 提出 RISER 框架，构建可重用推理向量库，并设计轻量级 Router 通过强化学习动态组合这些向量以响应输入。路由器在任务级奖励驱动下学习激活合适的认知原语，实现推理路径的自适应调控。

Result: 在七项基准测试中，RISER 实现 3.4-6.5% 的平均零样本准确率提升；优于 CoT 推理方式，具有 2-3 倍更高的令牌效率和显著的鲁棒性增益；分析显示其能生成可解释、精确的组合控制策略。

Conclusion: RISER 证明了通过可学习的、动态的激活干预可以有效提升大语言模型的推理能力，为实现更可控、高效、可解释的推理提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recent work on domain-specific reasoning with large language models (LLMs) often relies on training-intensive approaches that require parameter updates. While activation steering has emerged as a parameter efficient alternative, existing methods apply static, manual interventions that fail to adapt to the dynamic nature of complex reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose RISER (Router-based Intervention for Steerable Enhancement of Reasoning), a plug-and-play intervention framework that adaptively steers LLM reasoning in activation space. RISER constructs a library of reusable reasoning vectors and employs a lightweight Router to dynamically compose them for each input. The Router is optimized via reinforcement learning under task-level rewards, activating latent cognitive primitives in an emergent and compositional manner. Across seven diverse benchmarks, RISER yields 3.4-6.5% average zero-shot accuracy improvements over the base model while surpassing CoT-style reasoning with 2-3x higher token efficiency and robust accuracy gains. Further analysis shows that RISER autonomously combines multiple vectors into interpretable, precise control strategies, pointing toward more controllable and efficient LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Scientific reasoning relies not only on logical inference but also on activating prior knowledge and experiential structures. Memory can efficiently reuse knowledge and enhance reasoning consistency and stability. However, existing benchmarks mainly evaluate final answers or step-by-step coherence, overlooking the \textit{memory-driven} mechanisms that underlie human reasoning, which involves activating anchors and attractors, then integrating them into multi-step inference. To address this gap, we propose $A^3$-Bench~ https://a3-bench.github.io, a benchmark designed to evaluate scientific reasoning through dual-scale memory-driven activation, grounded in Anchor and Attractor Activation. First, we annotate 2,198 science reasoning problems across domains using the SAPM process(subject, anchor & attractor, problem, and memory developing). Second, we introduce a dual-scale memory evaluation framework utilizing anchors and attractors, along with the AAUI(Anchor--Attractor Utilization Index) metric to measure memory activation rates. Finally, through experiments with various base models and paradigms, we validate $A^3$-Bench and analyze how memory activation impacts reasoning performance, providing insights into memory-driven scientific reasoning.

Motivation: 大型推理模型在多步推理中生成复杂的思维链，导致敏感信息可能深嵌于推理过程，现有仅修改最终答案的去学习方法无法有效清除中间步骤中的敏感内容，造成持续的隐私泄露风险。

Method: STaR框架包括四步：1）语义感知检测识别敏感内容；2）通过安全提示前缀注入全局安全约束；3）轨迹感知抑制动态阻断推理链中的敏感内容；4）令牌级自适应过滤防止敏感词的精确或改写形式出现。

Conclusion: STaR为大型推理模型提供了高效、无参数的推理时隐私保护机制，解决了传统方法在中间推理步骤中隐私泄露的问题，建立了新的隐私保护标准。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have advanced automated multi-step reasoning, but their ability to generate complex Chain-of-Thought (CoT) trajectories introduces severe privacy risks, as sensitive information may be deeply embedded throughout the reasoning process. Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) unlearning approaches that typically focus on modifying only final answers are insufficient for LRMs, as they fail to remove sensitive content from intermediate steps, leading to persistent privacy leakage and degraded security. To address these challenges, we propose Sensitive Trajectory Regulation (STaR), a parameter-free, inference-time unlearning framework that achieves robust privacy protection throughout the reasoning process. Specifically, we first identify sensitive content via semantic-aware detection. Then, we inject global safety constraints through secure prompt prefix. Next, we perform trajectory-aware suppression to dynamically block sensitive content across the entire reasoning chain. Finally, we apply token-level adaptive filtering to prevent both exact and paraphrased sensitive tokens during generation. Furthermore, to overcome the inadequacies of existing evaluation protocols, we introduce two metrics: Multi-Decoding Consistency Assessment (MCS), which measures the consistency of unlearning across diverse decoding strategies, and Multi-Granularity Membership Inference Attack (MIA) Evaluation, which quantifies privacy protection at both answer and reasoning-chain levels. Experiments on the R-TOFU benchmark demonstrate that STaR achieves comprehensive and stable unlearning with minimal utility loss, setting a new standard for privacy-preserving reasoning in LRMs.

Abstract: Cluster workload allocation often requires complex configurations, creating a usability gap. This paper introduces a semantic, intent-driven scheduling paradigm for cluster systems using Natural Language Processing. The system employs a Large Language Model (LLM) integrated via a Kubernetes scheduler extender to interpret natural language allocation hint annotations for soft affinity preferences. A prototype featuring a cluster state cache and an intent analyzer (using AWS Bedrock) was developed. Empirical evaluation demonstrated high LLM parsing accuracy (>95% Subset Accuracy on an evaluation ground-truth dataset) for top-tier models like Amazon Nova Pro/Premier and Mistral Pixtral Large, significantly outperforming a baseline engine. Scheduling quality tests across six scenarios showed the prototype achieved superior or equivalent placement compared to standard Kubernetes configurations, particularly excelling in complex and quantitative scenarios and handling conflicting soft preferences. The results validate using LLMs for accessible scheduling but highlight limitations like synchronous LLM latency, suggesting asynchronous processing for production readiness. This work confirms the viability of semantic soft affinity for simplifying workload orchestration.

Abstract: Current large language model agents predominantly operate under a reactive paradigm, responding only to immediate user queries within short-term sessions. This limitation hinders their ability to maintain long-term user's intents and dynamically adapt to evolving external environments. In this paper, we propose a novel interaction paradigm for proactive Task-oriented Agents capable of bridging the gap between relatively static user's needs and a dynamic environment. We formalize proactivity through two key capabilities, (i) Intent-Conditioned Monitoring: The agent autonomously formulates trigger conditions based on dialog history; (ii) Event-Triggered Follow-up: The agent actively engages the user upon detecting useful environmental updates. We introduce a high-quality data synthesis pipeline to construct complex, multi-turn dialog data in a dynamic environment. Furthermore, we attempt to address the lack of evaluation criteria of task-oriented interaction in a dynamic environment by proposing a new benchmark, namely ChronosBench. We evaluated some leading close-source and open-source models at present and revealed their flaws in long-term task-oriented interaction. Furthermore, our fine-tuned model trained using synthetic data for supervised learning achieves a task completion rate of 85.19% for complex tasks including shifts in user intent, outperforming other models under test. And the result validated the effectiveness of our data-driven strategy.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are making significant progress in multimodal reasoning. Early approaches focus on pure text-based reasoning. More recent studies have incorporated multimodal information into the reasoning steps; however, they often follow a single task-specific reasoning pattern, which limits their generalizability across various multimodal tasks. In fact, there are numerous multimodal tasks requiring diverse reasoning skills, such as zooming in on a specific region or marking an object within an image. To address this, we propose unified generative multimodal reasoning, which unifies diverse multimodal reasoning skills by generating intermediate images during the reasoning process. We instantiate this paradigm with Omni-R1, a two-stage SFT+RL framework featuring perception alignment loss and perception reward, thereby enabling functional image generation. Additionally, we introduce Omni-R1-Zero, which eliminates the need for multimodal annotations by bootstrapping step-wise visualizations from text-only reasoning data. Empirical results show that Omni-R1 achieves unified generative reasoning across a wide range of multimodal tasks, and Omni-R1-Zero can match or even surpass Omni-R1 on average, suggesting a promising direction for generative multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems have evolved into practical LLM-driven collaborators for many applications, gaining robustness from diversity and cross-checking. However, multi-agent RL (MARL) training is resource-intensive and unstable: co-adapting teammates induce non-stationarity, and rewards are often sparse and high-variance. Therefore, we introduce \textbf{Multi-Agent Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (MATTRL)}, a framework that injects structured textual experience into multi-agent deliberation at inference time. MATTRL forms a multi-expert team of specialists for multi-turn discussions, retrieves and integrates test-time experiences, and reaches consensus for final decision-making. We also study credit assignment for constructing a turn-level experience pool, then reinjecting it into the dialogue. Across challenging benchmarks in medicine, math, and education, MATTRL improves accuracy by an average of 3.67\% over a multi-agent baseline, and by 8.67\% over comparable single-agent baselines. Ablation studies examine different credit-assignment schemes and provide a detailed comparison of how they affect training outcomes. MATTRL offers a stable, effective and efficient path to distribution-shift-robust multi-agent reasoning without tuning.
