TL;DR: V-Agent is a multi-agent platform for advanced video search and interactive conversations, using a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM) with a small video preference dataset and image-text retrieval vectors. It embeds video frames and audio transcriptions into a shared multimodal space for context-aware search. The system includes three agents—routing, search, and chat—that collaborate to refine results and engage users. The search agent uses VLM-based retrieval and re-ranking for improved accuracy. V-Agent achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on MultiVENT 2.0.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional text-based retrieval systems struggle with multimodal video content, lacking the ability to effectively interpret both visual and spoken information. There is a need for a more context-aware, interactive system that can handle complex user intents in video search.

Method: Fine-tune a vision-language model (VLM) on a small video preference dataset, integrate it with an image-text retrieval model's vector, and use a shared multimodal representation space to embed video frames and ASR-transcribed audio. Employ three agents: routing, search, and chat. The search agent combines VLM-based retrieval with a re-ranking module for enhanced precision.

Result: V-Agent achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the MultiVENT 2.0 benchmark, demonstrating superior capability in multimodal video search and interactive user-system conversation.

Conclusion: V-Agent presents a powerful, scalable solution for multimodal video search by combining fine-tuned VLMs, multimodal embedding, and collaborative multi-agent design, showing strong potential for real-world applications and future research.

Abstract: We introduce V-Agent, a novel multi-agent platform designed for advanced video search and interactive user-system conversations. By fine-tuning a vision-language model (VLM) with a small video preference dataset and enhancing it with a retrieval vector from an image-text retrieval model, we overcome the limitations of traditional text-based retrieval systems in multimodal scenarios. The VLM-based retrieval model independently embeds video frames and audio transcriptions from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) module into a shared multimodal representation space, enabling V-Agent to interpret both visual and spoken content for context-aware video search. This system consists of three agents-a routing agent, a search agent, and a chat agent-that work collaboratively to address user intents by refining search outputs and communicating with users. The search agent utilizes the VLM-based retrieval model together with an additional re-ranking module to further enhance video retrieval quality. Our proposed framework demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the MultiVENT 2.0 benchmark, highlighting its potential for both academic research and real-world applications.

*Reza Chandra,Adang Suhendra,Lintang Yuniar Banowosari,Prihandoko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study developed a deep learning-based system using CNN and VGG-16 models to detect pornographic web content. Results showed that the CNN model achieved 94.87% accuracy under optimal settings, making it superior to VGG-16 for fast and accurate detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Indonesian government blocked numerous websites containing negative content, including pornography, but these sites remained accessible via VPNs. This necessitated the development of a quick and effective method to identify pornographic content.

Method: The study developed a system using deep learning with CNN and VGG-16 models to detect pornographic image content on websites. The models were tested and compared under different configurations, specifically varying epoch values and learning rates.

Result: The CNN model achieved the best performance in the eighth experiment with 50 epochs and a learning rate of 0.001, achieving an accuracy of 94.87%, outperforming the VGG-16 model.

Conclusion: The CNN model is more effective than VGG-16 for quickly and accurately detecting pornographic content on websites.

Abstract: In 2020, a total of 59,741 websites were blocked by the Indonesian government due to containing negative content, including pornography, with 14,266 websites falling into this category. However, these blocked websites could still be accessed by the public using virtual private networks (VPNs). This prompted the research idea to quickly identify pornographic content. This study aims to develop a system capable of identifying websites suspected of containing pornographic image content, using a deep learning approach with convolutional neural network (CNN) and visual geometry group 16 (VGG-16) model. The two models were then explored comprehensively and holistically to determine which model was most effective in detecting pornographic content quickly. Based on the findings of the comparison between testing the CNN and VGG-16 models, research results showed that the best test results were obtained in the eighth experiment using the CNN model at an epoch value level of 50 and a learning rate of 0.001 of 0.9487 or 94.87%. This can be interpreted that the CNN model is more effective in detecting pornographic content quickly and accurately compared to using the VGG-16 model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种新方法，将Finer-CAM解释与TLS投影中的树体结构特征片段关联，系统评估驱动树种分类的特征。基于2,445棵欧洲树种的TLS数据，训练并验证了五个YOLOv8模型，平均准确率达96%（SD = 0.24%）。分析显示模型主要依赖冠层特征进行分类，但欧洲山毛榉、英国橡木和挪威云杉等物种更依赖冠层，而欧洲梣、苏格兰松和道格拉斯冷杉则更多依赖茎干特征，尤其是细枝部分。模型判断结果与人类专家认知一致，表明其决策逻辑具有可解释性。研究强调需进一步理解模型决策过程，以揭示数据集与模型的局限性、偏见，并增强预测可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有树种分类方法如激光雷达（TLS）与深度学习虽达高精度，但其决策过程不透明；传统解释方法如Finer-CAM在相似树种间应用较少，难以揭示具体驱动特征。因此亟需一种系统化方法来解析模型如何利用结构特征进行分类，提升模型可解释性与可信度。

Method: 结合Finer-CAM生成的显著性图与TLS投影中分割出的树体结构特征段，构建解释性分析框架。使用2,445棵树的多物种TLS数据，训练并交叉验证五种YOLOv8模型，通过分析630张显著性图，识别影响分类决策的关键结构特征。

Result: 模型平均分类准确率为96%（标准差0.24%），主要依赖冠层特征进行分类；但在欧洲梣、苏格兰松和道格拉斯冷杉中，茎干特征（特别是细枝）贡献更大。模型对相似树种的判断与人类专家认知一致，说明其具备合理的决策逻辑。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的解释方法有效揭示了深度学习模型在树种分类中的关键决策依据，强调了提升模型可解释性的重要性，有助于发现数据与模型的潜在偏差，增强模型预测的可靠性与可信任性。

Abstract: Classifying tree species has been a core research area in forest remote sensing for decades. New sensors and classification approaches like TLS and deep learning achieve state-of-the art accuracy but their decision processes remain unclear. Methods such as Finer-CAM (Class Activation Mapping) can highlight features in TLS projections that contribute to the classification of a target species, yet are uncommon in similar looking contrastive tree species. We propose a novel method linking Finer-CAM explanations to segments of TLS projections representing structural tree features to systemically evaluate which features drive species discrimination. Using TLS data from 2,445 trees across seven European tree species, we trained and validated five YOLOv8 models with cross-validation, reaching a mean accuracy of 96% (SD = 0.24%). Analysis of 630 saliency maps shows the models primarily rely on crown features in TLS projections for species classification. While this result is pronounced in Silver Birch, European Beech, English oak, and Norway spruce, stem features contribute more frequently to the differentiation of European ash, Scots pine, and Douglas fir. Particularly representations of finer branches contribute to the decisions of the models. The models consider those tree species similar to each other which a human expert would also regard as similar. Furthermore, our results highlight the need for an improved understanding of the decision processes of tree species classification models to help reveal data set and model limitations, biases, and to build confidence in model predictions.

*Chayan Jain,Rishant Sharma,Archit Garg,Ishan Bhanuka,Pratik Narang,Dhruv Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种类电影制作的多阶段文本到视频生成方法，通过大语言模型生成详细剧本，再利用文本到图像模型生成角色视觉锚点，最后由视频生成模型合成场景。实验表明，移除视觉锚点会导致角色一致性大幅下降（从7.99降至0.55），证明视觉先验对身份保持至关重要；同时发现当前模型在印度与西方主题生成中存在文化差异和偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到视频AI在生成长篇连贯视频故事时难以保持角色一致性，亟需一种更系统化的方法来提升生成质量与连贯性。

Method: 采用多阶段流程：首先用大语言模型生成详细生产脚本；接着用文本到图像模型根据脚本生成角色一致的视觉锚点；最后以这些锚点为引导，由视频生成模型逐个合成场景。

Result: 移除视觉锚点机制后，角色一致性评分从7.99骤降至0.55，验证了视觉先验的重要性；此外，分析显示模型在印度与西方主题生成中存在显著的文化差异，表现为主体一致性和动态程度的不同。

Conclusion: 该多阶段方法有效提升了视频生成中的角色一致性与叙事连贯性，强调视觉锚点的关键作用，并揭示了现有模型中的文化偏见问题，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Generating long, cohesive video stories with consistent characters is a significant challenge for current text-to-video AI. We introduce a method that approaches video generation in a filmmaker-like manner. Instead of creating a video in one step, our proposed pipeline first uses a large language model to generate a detailed production script. This script guides a text-to-image model in creating consistent visuals for each character, which then serve as anchors for a video generation model to synthesize each scene individually. Our baseline comparisons validate the necessity of this multi-stage decomposition; specifically, we observe that removing the visual anchoring mechanism results in a catastrophic drop in character consistency scores (from 7.99 to 0.55), confirming that visual priors are essential for identity preservation. Furthermore, we analyze cultural disparities in current models, revealing distinct biases in subject consistency and dynamic degree between Indian vs Western-themed generations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于信息论的自适应视频分词框架InfoTok，解决传统固定速率分词导致的冗余或信息丢失问题。通过理论证明现有无数据依赖训练方法次优，并提出基于证据下界（ELBO）的算法逼近理论最优。结合Transformer构建自适应压缩器，在保持性能的同时实现20%的令牌节省和2.3倍压缩率，显著优于现有启发式方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频分词方法采用固定速率压缩，无法适应视频内容的信息密度变化，导致冗余或信息损失。需要一种更智能、自适应的分词机制以提升效率与准确性。

Method: 基于香农信息论，提出理论分析证明现有训练方式的次优性；设计基于ELBO的优化算法，构建Transformer-based自适应压缩模型，实现按信息丰富度动态分配令牌。

Result: 在保持性能前提下，相比基准方法节省20%令牌，压缩率达2.3倍，显著优于已有启发式自适应方法。

Conclusion: InfoTok通过信息感知的自适应分词策略，实现了高效且准确的视频表示，为长视频处理提供了新范式，并为未来研究提供重要启示。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient discrete video tokenization is essential for long video sequences processing. Yet, the inherent complexity and variable information density of videos present a significant bottleneck for current tokenizers, which rigidly compress all content at a fixed rate, leading to redundancy or information loss. Drawing inspiration from Shannon's information theory, this paper introduces InfoTok, a principled framework for adaptive video tokenization. We rigorously prove that existing data-agnostic training methods are suboptimal in representation length, and present a novel evidence lower bound (ELBO)-based algorithm that approaches theoretical optimality. Leveraging this framework, we develop a transformer-based adaptive compressor that enables adaptive tokenization. Empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art compression performance, saving 20% tokens without influence on performance, and achieving 2.3x compression rates while still outperforming prior heuristic adaptive approaches. By allocating tokens according to informational richness, InfoTok enables a more compressed yet accurate tokenization for video representation, offering valuable insights for future research.

*Chiao-An Yang,Ryo Hachiuma,Sifei Liu,Subhashree Radhakrishnan,Raymond A. Yeh,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang,Min-Hung Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出4D-RGPT、P4D训练框架和R4D-Bench基准，以增强多模态大模型对4D时空结构的感知与推理能力，解决现有3D/4D视频问答任务中静态场景主导、缺乏区域级提示的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大模型在处理3D结构和时间动态时能力有限，主要受限于弱化的4D感知和时间理解能力；同时，现有的3D/4D视频问答基准大多聚焦静态场景，且缺少区域级提示机制，难以有效评估模型对动态深度场景的理解能力。

Method: 提出4D-RGPT，一种专门用于从视频输入中捕捉4D表示并增强时间感知的多模态大模型；设计感知4D蒸馏（P4D）训练框架，将冻结专家模型中的4D表示知识迁移至4D-RGPT中，实现全面的4D感知能力；构建R4D-Bench基准，通过自动化与人工验证相结合的混合流程，创建支持深度感知与区域级提示的动态场景评测数据集。

Result: 4D-RGPT在多个现有4D VQA基准及新提出的R4D-Bench上均取得显著性能提升，验证了其在4D时空理解与推理方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 本研究通过引入4D-RGPT模型、P4D训练方法以及R4D-Bench评测基准，系统性地提升了多模态大模型对复杂动态3D场景的感知与推理能力，为未来4D视觉理解研究提供了新的方向与工具支持。

Abstract: Despite advances in Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), their ability to reason over 3D structures and temporal dynamics remains limited, constrained by weak 4D perception and temporal understanding. Existing 3D and 4D Video Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks also emphasize static scenes and lack region-level prompting. We tackle these issues by introducing: (a) 4D-RGPT, a specialized MLLM designed to capture 4D representations from video inputs with enhanced temporal perception; (b) Perceptual 4D Distillation (P4D), a training framework that transfers 4D representations from a frozen expert model into 4D-RGPT for comprehensive 4D perception; and (c) R4D-Bench, a benchmark for depth-aware dynamic scenes with region-level prompting, built via a hybrid automated and human-verified pipeline. Our 4D-RGPT achieves notable improvements on both existing 4D VQA benchmarks and the proposed R4D-Bench benchmark.

### [7] [FORMSpoT: A Decade of Tree-Level, Country-Scale Forest Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17021)
*Martin Schwartz,Fajwel Fogel,Nikola Besic,Damien Robert,Louis Geist,Jean-Pierre Renaud,Jean-Matthieu Monnet,Clemens Mosig,Cédric Vega,Alexandre d'Aspremont,Loic Landrieu,Philippe Ciais*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FORMSpoT (Forest Mapping with SPOT Time series) provides a 1.5 m resolution, decade-long (2014–2024) forest canopy height map and annual disturbance detection (FORMSpoT-Δ) for mainland France using SPOT-6/7 data and a hierarchical transformer model (PVTv2) trained on airborne laser scanning (ALS). A custom post-processing pipeline enables accurate change detection across diverse satellite acquisitions through co-registration and spatio-temporal denoising. Validation shows superior performance over existing products, especially in mountainous areas with small, fragmented disturbances (F1-score of 0.44), enabling tree-level monitoring. This tool supports tracking forest management, early decline detection, and carbon loss quantification from subtle disturbances like thinning or selective logging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The declining European forest carbon sink necessitates high-resolution, frequent forest monitoring tools. Existing satellite disturbance products are too coarse (typically >100 m²) to detect individual-tree-scale changes, limiting their ability to capture subtle disturbances such as selective logging or thinning.

Method: FORMSpoT uses annual SPOT-6/7 composites processed with a PVTv2 hierarchical transformer model trained on ALS data to derive canopy height. A dedicated post-processing pipeline includes co-registration and spatio-temporal total variation denoising to ensure robust change detection across heterogeneous satellite acquisitions.

Result: FORMSpoT-Δ achieves an F1-score of 0.44 in mountainous forests—dramatically higher than existing benchmarks—enabling reliable detection of small, fragmented disturbances. The dataset allows tree-level monitoring at national scale and improves the detection of carbon losses from subtle forest changes.

Conclusion: FORMSpoT-Δ offers a powerful, high-resolution tool for national-scale forest monitoring, crucial for understanding forest dynamics under climate change. Sustained high-resolution satellite missions and open-data initiatives like DINAMIS are essential for long-term forest observation and carbon accounting.

Abstract: The recent decline of the European forest carbon sink highlights the need for spatially explicit and frequently updated forest monitoring tools. Yet, existing satellite-based disturbance products remain too coarse to detect changes at the scale of individual trees, typically below 100 m$^{2}$. Here, we introduce FORMSpoT (Forest Mapping with SPOT Time series), a decade-long (2014-2024) nationwide mapping of forest canopy height at 1.5 m resolution, together with annual disturbance polygons (FORMSpoT-$Δ$) covering mainland France. Canopy heights were derived from annual SPOT-6/7 composites using a hierarchical transformer model (PVTv2) trained on high-resolution airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. To enable robust change detection across heterogeneous acquisitions, we developed a dedicated post-processing pipeline combining co-registration and spatio-temporal total variation denoising. Validation against ALS revisits across 19 sites and 5,087 National Forest Inventory plots shows that FORMSpoT-$Δ$ substantially outperforms existing disturbance products. In mountainous forests, where disturbances are small and spatially fragmented, FORMSpoT-$Δ$ achieves an F1-score of 0.44, representing an order of magnitude higher than existing benchmarks. By enabling tree-level monitoring of forest dynamics at national scale, FORMSpoT-$Δ$ provides a unique tool to analyze management practices, detect early signals of forest decline, and better quantify carbon losses from subtle disturbances such as thinning or selective logging. These results underscore the critical importance of sustaining very high-resolution satellite missions like SPOT and open-data initiatives such as DINAMIS for monitoring forests under climate change.

### [8] [Infinite-Homography as Robust Conditioning for Camera-Controlled Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17040)
*Min-Jung Kim,Jeongho Kim,Hoiyeong Jin,Junha Hyung,Jaegul Choo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfCam is a depth-free, camera-controlled video generation framework that achieves high pose fidelity through latent-space rotation encoding and end-to-end parallax prediction, enhanced by a data augmentation pipeline for diverse trajectories, outperforming existing methods in both accuracy and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for camera-controlled video generation struggle with inaccuracies in depth estimation and limited diversity of camera trajectories in datasets, leading to poor pose fidelity and visual quality.

Method: InfCam introduces a depth-free framework using infinite homography warping to encode 3D camera rotations directly in the 2D latent space of a video diffusion model. It predicts a residual parallax term end-to-end to achieve high pose fidelity. A data augmentation pipeline transforms synthetic multiview datasets into diverse trajectories and focal lengths.

Result: InfCam outperforms baseline methods in camera-pose accuracy and visual fidelity, demonstrating strong generalization from synthetic to real-world data.

Conclusion: InfCam provides a robust, depth-free solution for high-fidelity camera-controlled video generation by leveraging latent-space rotation encoding and diverse data augmentation.

Abstract: Recent progress in video diffusion models has spurred growing interest in camera-controlled novel-view video generation for dynamic scenes, aiming to provide creators with cinematic camera control capabilities in post-production. A key challenge in camera-controlled video generation is ensuring fidelity to the specified camera pose, while maintaining view consistency and reasoning about occluded geometry from limited observations. To address this, existing methods either train trajectory-conditioned video generation model on trajectory-video pair dataset, or estimate depth from the input video to reproject it along a target trajectory and generate the unprojected regions. Nevertheless, existing methods struggle to generate camera-pose-faithful, high-quality videos for two main reasons: (1) reprojection-based approaches are highly susceptible to errors caused by inaccurate depth estimation; and (2) the limited diversity of camera trajectories in existing datasets restricts learned models. To address these limitations, we present InfCam, a depth-free, camera-controlled video-to-video generation framework with high pose fidelity. The framework integrates two key components: (1) infinite homography warping, which encodes 3D camera rotations directly within the 2D latent space of a video diffusion model. Conditioning on this noise-free rotational information, the residual parallax term is predicted through end-to-end training to achieve high camera-pose fidelity; and (2) a data augmentation pipeline that transforms existing synthetic multiview datasets into sequences with diverse trajectories and focal lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that InfCam outperforms baseline methods in camera-pose accuracy and visual fidelity, generalizing well from synthetic to real-world data.

Conclusion: IUS为合成医学图像的质量评估提供了可解释、高效且通用的新范式，显著提升了合成数据在构建临床决策支持系统中的实用价值，推动了隐私保护下大规模医学数据生成的应用发展。

Abstract: Synthetic medical image data can unlock the potential of deep learning (DL)-based clinical decision support (CDS) systems through the creation of large scale, privacy-preserving, training sets. Despite the significant progress in this field, there is still a largely unanswered research question: "How can we quantitatively assess the similarity of a synthetically generated set of images with a set of real images in a given application domain?". Today, answers to this question are mainly provided via user evaluation studies, inception-based measures, and the classification performance achieved on synthetic images. This paper proposes a novel measure to assess the similarity between synthetically generated and real sets of images, in terms of their utility for the development of DL-based CDS systems. Inspired by generalized neural additive models, and unlike inception-based measures, the proposed measure is interpretable (Interpretable Utility Similarity, IUS), explaining why a synthetic dataset could be more useful than another one in the context of a CDS system based on clinically relevant image features. The experimental results on publicly available datasets from various color medical imaging modalities including endoscopic, dermoscopic and fundus imaging, indicate that selecting synthetic images of high utility similarity using IUS can result in relative improvements of up to 54.6% in terms of classification performance. The generality of IUS for synthetic data assessment is demonstrated also for greyscale X-ray and ultrasound imaging modalities. IUS implementation is available at https://github.com/innoisys/ius

Abstract: The creation of photorealistic dynamic hair remains a major challenge in digital human modeling because of the complex motions, occlusions, and light scattering. Existing methods often resort to static capture and physics-based models that do not scale as they require manual parameter fine-tuning to handle the diversity of hairstyles and motions, and heavy computation to obtain high-quality appearance. In this paper, we present Dynamic Gaussian Hair (DGH), a novel framework that efficiently learns hair dynamics and appearance. We propose: (1) a coarse-to-fine model that learns temporally coherent hair motion dynamics across diverse hairstyles; (2) a strand-guided optimization module that learns a dynamic 3D Gaussian representation for hair appearance with support for differentiable rendering, enabling gradient-based learning of view-consistent appearance under motion. Unlike prior simulation-based pipelines, our approach is fully data-driven, scales with training data, and generalizes across various hairstyles and head motion sequences. Additionally, DGH can be seamlessly integrated into a 3D Gaussian avatar framework, enabling realistic, animatable hair for high-fidelity avatar representation. DGH achieves promising geometry and appearance results, providing a scalable, data-driven alternative to physics-based simulation and rendering.

Abstract: Maritime autonomous systems require robust predictive capabilities to anticipate vessel motion and environmental dynamics. While transformer architectures have revolutionized AIS-based trajectory prediction and demonstrated feasibility for sonar frame forecasting, their application to maritime radar frame prediction remains unexplored, creating a critical gap given radar's all-weather reliability for navigation. This survey systematically reviews predictive modeling approaches relevant to maritime radar, with emphasis on transformer architectures for spatiotemporal sequence forecasting, where existing representative methods are analyzed according to data type, architecture, and prediction horizon. Our review shows that, while the literature has demonstrated transformer-based frame prediction for sonar sensing, no prior work addresses transformer-based maritime radar frame prediction, thereby defining a clear research gap and motivating a concrete research direction for future work in this area.

Abstract: Photographs of people taken by professional photographers typically present the person in beautiful lighting, with an interesting pose, and flattering quality. This is unlike common photos people can take of themselves. In this paper, we explore how to create a ``professional'' version of a person's photograph, i.e., in a chosen pose, in a simple environment, with good lighting, and standard black top/bottom clothing. A key challenge is to preserve the person's unique identity, face and body features while transforming the photo. If there would exist a large paired dataset of the same person photographed both ``in the wild'' and by a professional photographer, the problem would potentially be easier to solve. However, such data does not exist, especially for a large variety of identities. To that end, we propose two key insights: 1) Our method transforms the input photo and person's face to a canonical UV space, which is further coupled with reposing methodology to model occlusions and novel view synthesis. Operating in UV space allows us to leverage existing unpaired datasets. 2) We personalize the output photo via multi image finetuning. Our approach yields high-quality, reposed portraits and achieves strong qualitative and quantitative performance on real-world imagery.

Abstract: We present a framework for document-centric background generation with multi-page editing and thematic continuity. To ensure text regions remain readable, we employ a \emph{latent masking} formulation that softly attenuates updates in the diffusion space, inspired by smooth barrier functions in physics and numerical optimization. In addition, we introduce \emph{Automated Readability Optimization (ARO)}, which automatically places semi-transparent, rounded backing shapes behind text regions. ARO determines the minimal opacity needed to satisfy perceptual contrast standards (WCAG 2.2) relative to the underlying background, ensuring readability while maintaining aesthetic harmony without human intervention. Multi-page consistency is maintained through a summarization-and-instruction process, where each page is distilled into a compact representation that recursively guides subsequent generations. This design reflects how humans build continuity by retaining prior context, ensuring that visual motifs evolve coherently across an entire document. Our method further treats a document as a structured composition in which text, figures, and backgrounds are preserved or regenerated as separate layers, allowing targeted background editing without compromising readability. Finally, user-provided prompts allow stylistic adjustments in color and texture, balancing automated consistency with flexible customization. Our training-free framework produces visually coherent, text-preserving, and thematically aligned documents, bridging generative modeling with natural design workflows.

Abstract: Fine-grained fire prediction plays a crucial role in emergency response. Infrared images and fire masks provide complementary thermal and boundary information, yet current methods are predominantly limited to binary mask modeling with inherent signal sparsity, failing to capture the complex dynamics of fire. While world models show promise in video generation, their physical inconsistencies pose significant challenges for fire forecasting. This paper introduces PhysFire-WM, a Physics-informed World Model for emulating Fire spread dynamics. Our approach internalizes combustion dynamics by encoding structured priors from a Physical Simulator to rectify physical discrepancies, coupled with a Cross-task Collaborative Training strategy (CC-Train) that alleviates the issue of limited information in mask-based modeling. Through parameter sharing and gradient coordination, CC-Train effectively integrates thermal radiation dynamics and spatial boundary delineation, enhancing both physical realism and geometric accuracy. Extensive experiments on a fine-grained multimodal fire dataset demonstrate the superior accuracy of PhysFire-WM in fire spread prediction. Validation underscores the importance of physical priors and cross-task collaboration, providing new insights for applying physics-informed world models to disaster prediction.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong performance in zero-shot image classification tasks. However, existing methods, including Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), all rely on annotated text-to-image pairs for aligning visual and textual modalities. This dependency introduces substantial cost and accuracy requirement in preparing high-quality datasets. At the same time, processing data from two modes also requires dual-tower encoders for most models, which also hinders their lightweight. To address these limitations, we introduce a ``Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training via Large-Language-Model-based Generation (LGCLIP)" framework. LGCLIP leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate class-specific prompts that guide a diffusion model in synthesizing reference images. Afterwards these generated images serve as visual prototypes, and the visual features of real images are extracted and compared with the visual features of these prototypes to achieve comparative prediction. By optimizing prompt generation through the LLM and employing only a visual encoder, LGCLIP remains lightweight and efficient. Crucially, our framework requires only class labels as input during whole experimental procedure, eliminating the need for manually annotated image-text pairs and extra pre-processing. Experimental results validate the feasibility and efficiency of LGCLIP, demonstrating great performance in zero-shot classification tasks and establishing a novel paradigm for classification.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has achieved remarkable performance in various multimodal tasks. However, it still struggles with compositional image-text matching, particularly in accurately associating objects with their corresponding attributes, because its inherent global representation often overlooks fine-grained semantics for attribute binding. Existing methods often require additional training or extensive hard negative sampling, yet they frequently show limited generalization to novel compositional concepts and fail to fundamentally address the drawbacks of global representations. In this paper, we propose ABE-CLIP, a novel training-free Attribute Binding Enhancement method designed to strengthen attribute-object binding in CLIP-like models. Specifically, we employ a Semantic Refinement Mechanism to refine token embeddings for both object and attribute phrases in the text, thereby mitigating attribute confusion and improving semantic precision. We further introduce a Local Token-Patch Alignment strategy that computes similarity scores between refined textual tokens and their most relevant image patches. By aggregating localized similarity scores, ABE-CLIP computes the final image-text similarity. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that ABE-CLIP significantly improves attribute-object binding performance, even surpassing methods that require extensive training.

Abstract: Quantifying and assessing urban greenery is consequential for planning and development, reflecting the everlasting importance of green spaces for multiple climate and well-being dimensions of cities. Evaluation can be broadly grouped into objective (e.g., measuring the amount of greenery) and subjective (e.g., polling the perception of people) approaches, which may differ -- what people see and feel about how green a place is might not match the measurements of the actual amount of vegetation. In this work, we advance the state of the art by measuring such differences and explaining them through human, geographic, and spatial dimensions. The experiments rely on contextual information extracted from street view imagery and a comprehensive urban visual perception survey collected from 1,000 people across five countries with their extensive demographic and personality information. We analyze the discrepancies between objective measures (e.g., Green View Index (GVI)) and subjective scores (e.g., pairwise ratings), examining whether they can be explained by a variety of human and visual factors such as age group and spatial variation of greenery in the scene. The findings reveal that such discrepancies are comparable around the world and that demographics and personality do not play a significant role in perception. Further, while perceived and measured greenery correlate consistently across geographies (both where people and where imagery are from), where people live plays a significant role in explaining perceptual differences, with these two, as the top among seven, features that influences perceived greenery the most. This location influence suggests that cultural, environmental, and experiential factors substantially shape how individuals observe greenery in cities.

Abstract: Mobile devices equipped with a multi-camera system and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) are widely used nowadays, such as self-driving cars. The task of relative pose estimation using visual and inertial information has important applications in various fields. To improve the accuracy of relative pose estimation of multi-camera systems, we propose a globally optimal solver using affine correspondences to estimate the generalized relative pose with a known vertical direction. First, a cost function about the relative rotation angle is established after decoupling the rotation matrix and translation vector, which minimizes the algebraic error of geometric constraints from affine correspondences. Then, the global optimization problem is converted into two polynomials with two unknowns based on the characteristic equation and its first derivative is zero. Finally, the relative rotation angle can be solved using the polynomial eigenvalue solver, and the translation vector can be obtained from the eigenvector. Besides, a new linear solution is proposed when the relative rotation is small. The proposed solver is evaluated on synthetic data and real-world datasets. The experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods in accuracy.

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (MedVLMs) show immense promise in clinical applicability. However, their reliability is hindered by hallucinations, where models often fail to derive answers from visual evidence, instead relying on learned textual priors. Existing mitigation strategies for MedVLMs have distinct limitations: training-based methods rely on costly expert annotations, limiting scalability, while training-free interventions like contrastive decoding, though data-efficient, apply a global, untargeted correction whose effects in complex real-world clinical settings can be unreliable. To address these challenges, we introduce Anatomical Region-Guided Contrastive Decoding (ARCD), a plug-and-play strategy that mitigates hallucinations by providing targeted, region-specific guidance. Our module leverages an anatomical mask to direct a three-tiered contrastive decoding process. By dynamically re-weighting at the token, attention, and logits levels, it verifiably steers the model's focus onto specified regions, reinforcing anatomical understanding and suppressing factually incorrect outputs. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, including chest X-ray, CT, brain MRI, and ocular ultrasound, demonstrate our method's effectiveness in improving regional understanding, reducing hallucinations, and enhancing overall diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: Exploration capacity shapes both inference-time performance and reinforcement learning (RL) training for large (vision-) language models, as stochastic sampling often yields redundant reasoning paths with little high-level diversity. This paper proposes Reasoning Palette, a novel latent-modulation framework that endows the model with a stochastic latent variable for strategic contextualization, guiding its internal planning prior to token generation. This latent context is inferred from the mean-pooled embedding of a question-answer pair via a variational autoencoder (VAE), where each sampled latent potentially encodes a distinct reasoning context. During inference, a sampled latent is decoded into learnable token prefixes and prepended to the input prompt, modulating the model's internal reasoning trajectory. In this way, the model performs internal sampling over reasoning strategies prior to output generation, which shapes the style and structure of the entire response sequence. A brief supervised fine-tuning (SFT) warm-up phase allows the model to adapt to this latent conditioning. Within RL optimization, Reasoning Palette facilitates structured exploration by enabling on-demand injection for diverse reasoning modes, significantly enhancing exploration efficiency and sustained learning capability. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method enables interpretable and controllable control over the (vision-) language model's strategic behavior, thereby achieving consistent performance gains over standard RL methods.

Conclusion: CheXPO-v2通过过程监督与知识图谱驱动的细粒度奖励，有效抑制医疗VLM中的幻觉行为，实现高准确率、强可验证性的推理，为临床部署提供了更安全可靠的技术路径。

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are prone to hallucinations, compromising clinical reliability. While reinforcement learning methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) offer a low-cost alignment solution, their reliance on sparse, outcome-based rewards inadvertently encourages models to "overthink" -- generating verbose, convoluted, and unverifiable Chain-of-Thought reasoning to justify answers. This focus on outcomes obscures factual errors and poses significant safety risks. To address this, we propose CheXPO-v2, a novel alignment framework that shifts from outcome to process supervision. Our core innovation is a Knowledge Graph Consistency Reward mechanism driven by Entity-Relation Matching. By explicitly parsing reasoning steps into structured "Disease, Relation, Anatomy" triplets, we provide fine-grained supervision that penalizes incoherent logic and hallucinations at the atomic level. Integrating this with a hard-example mining strategy, our approach significantly outperforms GRPO and state-of-the-art models on benchmarks like MIMIC-CXR-VQA. Crucially, CheXPO-v2 achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy using only 5k samples, demonstrating exceptional data efficiency while producing clinically sound and verifiable reasoning.

Abstract: Optical satellites, with their diverse band layouts and ground sampling distances, supply indispensable evidence for tasks ranging from ecosystem surveillance to emergency response. However, significant discrepancies in band composition and spatial resolution across different optical sensors present major challenges for existing Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). These models are typically pretrained on fixed band configurations and resolutions, making them vulnerable to real world scenarios involving missing bands, cross sensor fusion, and unseen spatial scales, thereby limiting their generalization and practical deployment. To address these limitations, we propose Any Optical Model (AOM), a universal RSFM explicitly designed to accommodate arbitrary band compositions, sensor types, and resolution scales. To preserve distinctive spectral characteristics even when bands are missing or newly introduced, AOM introduces a spectrum-independent tokenizer that assigns each channel a dedicated band embedding, enabling explicit encoding of spectral identity. To effectively capture texture and contextual patterns from sub-meter to hundred-meter imagery, we design a multi-scale adaptive patch embedding mechanism that dynamically modulates the receptive field. Furthermore, to maintain global semantic consistency across varying resolutions, AOM incorporates a multi-scale semantic alignment mechanism alongside a channel-wise self-supervised masking and reconstruction pretraining strategy that jointly models spectral-spatial relationships. Extensive experiments on over 10 public datasets, including those from Sentinel-2, Landsat, and HLS, demonstrate that AOM consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance under challenging conditions such as band missing, cross sensor, and cross resolution settings.

Result: 在多个挑战性基准测试中，该方法在大规模环境下实现了显著的定位性能提升，且计算与内存效率高。

Conclusion: 结合几何结构与视觉相似性的全局描述符学习方法能有效提高视觉定位的鲁棒性与准确性，尤其在复杂、噪声干扰环境中表现优异。

Abstract: Recent learning-based visual localization methods use global descriptors to disambiguate visually similar places, but existing approaches often derive these descriptors from geometric cues alone (e.g., covisibility graphs), limiting their discriminative power and reducing robustness in the presence of noisy geometric constraints. We propose an aggregator module that learns global descriptors consistent with both geometrical structure and visual similarity, ensuring that images are close in descriptor space only when they are visually similar and spatially connected. This corrects erroneous associations caused by unreliable overlap scores. Using a batch-mining strategy based solely on the overlap scores and a modified contrastive loss, our method trains without manual place labels and generalizes across diverse environments. Experiments on challenging benchmarks show substantial localization gains in large-scale environments while preserving computational and memory efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于课程学习的框架，以解决多模态大模型在复杂视觉推理任务中因“视觉遗忘”导致的性能下降问题。通过分离抽象逻辑推理与视觉感知策略两种认知能力，并分别进行训练：首先在纯文本数据上构建稳健的推理基础，再引入感知锚定的思维链（PG-CoT）；其次将感知时机建模为强化学习问题，设计关键感知奖励机制，使模型学会在认知不确定时自主决定何时观察。该方法有效提升模型的视觉接地能力和推理持续性，实现从经验驱动到策略驱动的转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大模型在长链条视觉推理任务中存在‘视觉遗忘’现象，即随着推理过程延长，模型逐渐失去对视觉信息的依赖。这源于现有训练范式过早地将抽象逻辑推理与视觉感知策略耦合，导致模型缺乏有效的‘何时看’的决策机制，从而影响长期推理能力。

Method: 提出一个两阶段课程学习框架：(1) 先通过纯文本数据上的监督微调建立强大的抽象推理能力；(2) 再引入感知锚定的思维链（PG-CoT）将视觉信息逐步融入推理过程；同时，将感知时机建模为强化学习问题，使用基于认知不确定性的提示词（如'wait', 'verify'）作为信号，设计关键感知奖励函数，训练模型自主学习视觉感知策略。

Result: 实验表明，所提方法显著提升了多模态大模型在复杂、长链视觉推理任务中的表现，有效缓解了视觉遗忘问题，增强了模型的视觉接地性和推理稳定性。模型具备了自主判断何时需要查看视觉信息的能力，实现了从被动观察到主动感知的转变。

Conclusion: 本文系统揭示了多模态大模型在长链推理中的两大缺陷——基础推理冷启动不足与战略感知缺失，并提出一种可解释、可扩展的两阶段训练框架，成功实现认知能力的解耦与协同优化，推动模型向更可靠、更智能的视觉推理方向演进。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate significant potential but remain brittle in complex, long-chain visual reasoning tasks. A critical failure mode is "visual forgetting", where models progressively lose visual grounding as reasoning extends, a phenomenon aptly described as "think longer, see less". We posit this failure stems from current training paradigms prematurely entangling two distinct cognitive skills: (1) abstract logical reasoning "how-to-think") and (2) strategic visual perception ("when-to-look"). This creates a foundational cold-start deficiency -- weakening abstract reasoning -- and a strategic perception deficit, as models lack a policy for when to perceive. In this paper, we propose a novel curriculum-based framework to disentangle these skills. First, we introduce a disentangled Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) curriculum that builds a robust abstract reasoning backbone on text-only data before anchoring it to vision with a novel Perception-Grounded Chain-of-Thought (PG-CoT) paradigm. Second, we resolve the strategic perception deficit by formulating timing as a reinforcement learning problem. We design a Pivotal Perception Reward that teaches the model when to look by coupling perceptual actions to linguistic markers of cognitive uncertainty (e.g., "wait", "verify"), thereby learning an autonomous grounding policy. Our contributions include the formalization of these two deficiencies and the development of a principled, two-stage framework to address them, transforming the model from a heuristic-driven observer to a strategic, grounded reasoner. \textbf{Code}: \url{https://github.com/gaozilve-max/learning-when-to-look}.

Abstract: Long Video Question-Answering (LVQA) presents a significant challenge for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) due to immense context and overloaded information, which could also lead to prohibitive memory consumption. While existing methods attempt to address these issues by reducing visual tokens or extending model's context length, they may miss useful information or take considerable computation. In fact, when answering given questions, only a small amount of crucial information is required. Therefore, we propose an efficient question-aware memory mechanism, enabling MLLMs to recurrently seek these critical clues. Our approach, named VideoDetective, simplifies this task by iteratively processing video sub-segments. For each sub-segment, a question-aware compression strategy is employed by introducing a few special memory tokens to achieve purposefully compression. This allows models to effectively seek critical clues while reducing visual tokens. Then, due to history context could have a significant impact, we recurrently aggregate and store these memory tokens to update history context, which would be reused for subsequent sub-segments. Furthermore, to more effectively measure model's long video understanding ability, we introduce GLVC (Grounding Long Video Clues), a long video question-answering dataset, which features grounding critical and concrete clues scattered throughout entire videos. Experimental results demonstrate our method enables MLLMs with limited context length of 32K to efficiently process 100K tokens (3600 frames, an hour-long video sampled at 1fps), requiring only 2 minutes and 37GB GPU memory usage. Evaluation results across multiple long video benchmarks illustrate our method can more effectively seek critical clues from massive information.

Abstract: Learning directly from human demonstration videos is a key milestone toward scalable and generalizable robot learning. Yet existing methods rely on intermediate representations such as keypoints or trajectories, introducing information loss and cumulative errors that harm temporal and visual consistency. We present Mitty, a Diffusion Transformer that enables video In-Context Learning for end-to-end Human2Robot video generation. Built on a pretrained video diffusion model, Mitty leverages strong visual-temporal priors to translate human demonstrations into robot-execution videos without action labels or intermediate abstractions. Demonstration videos are compressed into condition tokens and fused with robot denoising tokens through bidirectional attention during diffusion. To mitigate paired-data scarcity, we also develop an automatic synthesis pipeline that produces high-quality human-robot pairs from large egocentric datasets. Experiments on Human2Robot and EPIC-Kitchens show that Mitty delivers state-of-the-art results, strong generalization to unseen environments, and new insights for scalable robot learning from human observations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胸部X光（CXRs）的鲁棒解剖分割面临标注数据稀缺和真实世界采集条件差异大的挑战。现有方法难以在不同投影角度下实现通用分割，且依赖大量高质量标注，限制了其实际应用。因此需要一种无需依赖真实标注、能适应多种拍摄角度的通用分割框架。

Conclusion: AnyCXR展示了仅用合成数据即可构建强大、通用且鲁棒的胸部X光解剖分割系统的能力，为降低人工标注需求、增强跨设备与投影角度的适应性提供了可行方案，具有重要的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Robust anatomical segmentation of chest X-rays (CXRs) remains challenging due to the scarcity of comprehensive annotations and the substantial variability of real-world acquisition conditions. We propose AnyCXR, a unified framework that enables generalizable multi-organ segmentation across arbitrary CXR projection angles using only synthetic supervision. The method combines a Multi-stage Domain Randomization (MSDR) engine, which generates over 100,000 anatomically faithful and highly diverse synthetic radiographs from 3D CT volumes, with a Conditional Joint Annotation Regularization (CAR) learning strategy that leverages partial and imperfect labels by enforcing anatomical consistency in a latent space. Trained entirely on synthetic data, AnyCXR achieves strong zero-shot generalization on multiple real-world datasets, providing accurate delineation of 54 anatomical structures in PA, lateral, and oblique views. The resulting segmentation maps support downstream clinical tasks, including automated cardiothoracic ratio estimation, spine curvature assessment, and disease classification, where the incorporation of anatomical priors improves diagnostic performance. These results demonstrate that AnyCXR establishes a scalable and reliable foundation for anatomy-aware CXR analysis and offers a practical pathway toward reducing annotation burdens while improving robustness across diverse imaging conditions.

*Cuixin Yang,Rongkang Dong,Kin-Man Lam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于视觉-语言模型（VLM）引导的图像修复框架（VLMIR），通过融合视觉与语言先验知识，提升图像修复的保真度和语义一致性。该方法分为两阶段：第一阶段利用VLM（如CLIP）提取输入图像的互补视觉与语言表征，通过对比损失与LoRA微调对齐低质与高质图像的文本嵌入，并引入退化预测器分离退化与干净内容嵌入；第二阶段将这些嵌入通过交叉注意力机制注入扩散模型，实现更精细的修复。大量实验表明，VLMIR在通用及特定退化类型任务中均表现优异，验证了视觉-语言联合建模对图像修复的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像修复方法难以同时兼顾像素级保真度与高层语义理解，尽管引入视觉-语言模型（VLM）可提升跨模态对齐能力，但缺乏利用语言先验来保证修复结果的语义连贯性，限制了恢复质量。

Method: 提出VLMIR框架，包含两个阶段：1）基于VLM的特征提取，通过对比学习与LoRA微调对齐低质与高质图像的文本嵌入，并使用退化预测器分解图像内容与退化成分；2）将提取的视觉与语言嵌入通过交叉注意力机制融入扩散模型，增强修复过程中的感知与语义理解能力。

Result: 在多种通用与特定退化类型的图像修复任务上，VLMIR显著优于现有方法，尤其在保持细节真实性和语义一致性方面表现突出，且消融实验证明各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: 集成视觉-语言先验的VLMIR框架能有效提升图像修复性能，证明了融合多模态知识在推动图像修复技术发展中的关键价值。

Abstract: Many image restoration (IR) tasks require both pixel-level fidelity and high-level semantic understanding to recover realistic photos with fine-grained details. However, previous approaches often struggle to effectively leverage both the visual and linguistic knowledge. Recent efforts have attempted to incorporate Vision-language models (VLMs), which excel at aligning visual and textual features, into universal IR. Nevertheless, these methods fail to utilize the linguistic priors to ensure semantic coherence during the restoration process. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose the Vision-Language Model Guided Image Restoration (VLMIR) framework, which leverages the rich vision-language priors of VLMs, such as CLIP, to enhance IR performance through improved visual perception and semantic understanding. Our approach consists of two stages: VLM-based feature extraction and diffusion-based image restoration. In the first stage, we extract complementary visual and linguistic representations of input images by condensing the visual perception and high-level semantic priors through VLMs. Specifically, we align the embeddings of captions from low-quality and high-quality images using a cosine similarity loss with LoRA fine-tuning, and employ a degradation predictor to decompose degradation and clean image content embeddings. These complementary visual and textual embeddings are then integrated into a diffusion-based model via cross-attention mechanisms for enhanced restoration. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that VLMIR achieves superior performance across both universal and degradation-specific IR tasks, underscoring the critical role of integrated visual and linguistic knowledge from VLMs in advancing image restoration capabilities.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce RadImageNet-VQA, a large-scale dataset designed to advance radiologic visual question answering (VQA) on CT and MRI exams. Existing medical VQA datasets are limited in scale, dominated by X-ray imaging or biomedical illustrations, and often prone to text-based shortcuts. RadImageNet-VQA is built from expert-curated annotations and provides 750K images paired with 7.5M question-answer samples. It covers three key tasks - abnormality detection, anatomy recognition, and pathology identification - spanning eight anatomical regions and 97 pathology categories, and supports open-ended, closed-ended, and multiple-choice questions. Extensive experiments show that state-of-the-art vision-language models still struggle with fine-grained pathology identification, particularly in open-ended settings and even after fine-tuning. Text-only analysis further reveals that model performance collapses to near-random without image inputs, confirming that RadImageNet-VQA is free from linguistic shortcuts.

TL;DR: 提出HiSIR-Net框架，通过轻量级模块解决高分辨率PCBA缺陷检测中标签数据不足、微小缺陷难以识别的问题。采用选择性输入重建门（SIR-Gate）减少误报，结合区域优化的补丁选择（ROPS）实现跨分辨率一致重建，生成高精度异常图。构建了500张图像的SIPCBA-500自收集数据集，实验表明方法在定位性能和运行速度上均表现优异。

Conclusion: HiSIR-Net有效解决了高分辨率PCBA缺陷检测中的关键挑战，具备实用价值，为后续研究提供了高质量数据与代码支持。

Abstract: Automated defect inspection of assembled Printed Circuit Board Assemblies (PCBA) is quite challenging due to the insufficient labeled data, micro-defects with just a few pixels in visually-complex and high-resolution images. To address these challenges, we present HiSIR-Net, a High resolution, Self-supervised Reconstruction framework for pixel-wise PCBA localization. Our design combines two lightweight modules that make this practical on real 4K-resolution boards: (i) a Selective Input-Reconstruction Gate (SIR-Gate) that lets the model decide where to trust reconstruction versus the original input, thereby reducing irrelevant reconstruction artifacts and false alarms; and (ii) a Region-level Optimized Patch Selection (ROPS) scheme with positional cues to select overlapping patch reconstructions coherently across arbitrary resolutions. Organically integrating these mechanisms yields clean, high-resolution anomaly maps with low false positive (FP) rate. To bridge the gap in high-resolution PCBA datasets, we further contribute a self-collected dataset named SIPCBA-500 of 500 images. We conduct extensive experiments on our SIPCBA-500 as well as public benchmarks, demonstrating the superior localization performance of our method while running at practical speed. Full code and dataset will be made available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: ProCache提出了一种无需训练的动态特征缓存框架，通过非均匀激活调度和选择性计算，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升Diffusion Transformers（DiTs）的推理速度，实现最高2.90倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征缓存方法在时间动态性和误差累积方面存在局限，无法有效适应DiT中非均匀的时间特性，导致性能下降或误差积累。

Method: 提出约束感知的缓存模式搜索模块以生成非均匀激活调度，并设计选择性计算模块在深层块和高重要性标记上选择性地计算缓存段，从而减少误差传播并降低开销。

Result: 在PixArt-alpha和DiT上的实验表明，ProCache实现了高达1.96倍和2.90倍的加速，且质量损失极小，显著优于先前基于缓存的方法。

Conclusion: ProCache通过动态调整缓存策略，有效解决了特征缓存中的时间不均与误差累积问题，为DiT的高效部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling, yet their high computational cost hinders real-time deployment. While feature caching offers a promising training-free acceleration solution by exploiting temporal redundancy, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) uniform caching intervals fail to align with the non-uniform temporal dynamics of DiT, and (2) naive feature reuse with excessively large caching intervals can lead to severe error accumulation. In this work, we analyze the evolution of DiT features during denoising and reveal that both feature changes and error propagation are highly time- and depth-varying. Motivated by this, we propose ProCache, a training-free dynamic feature caching framework that addresses these issues via two core components: (i) a constraint-aware caching pattern search module that generates non-uniform activation schedules through offline constrained sampling, tailored to the model's temporal characteristics; and (ii) a selective computation module that selectively computes within deep blocks and high-importance tokens for cached segments to mitigate error accumulation with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments on PixArt-alpha and DiT demonstrate that ProCache achieves up to 1.96x and 2.90x acceleration with negligible quality degradation, significantly outperforming prior caching-based methods.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong perception and reasoning performance on existing remote sensing (RS) benchmarks. However, most prior benchmarks rely on low-resolution imagery, and some high-resolution benchmarks suffer from flawed reasoning-task designs. We show that text-only LLMs can perform competitively with multimodal vision-language models on RS reasoning tasks without access to images, revealing a critical mismatch between current benchmarks and the intended evaluation of visual understanding. To enable faithful assessment, we introduce RSHR-Bench, a super-high-resolution benchmark for RS visual understanding and reasoning. RSHR-Bench contains 5,329 full-scene images with a long side of at least 4,000 pixels, with up to about 3 x 10^8 pixels per image, sourced from widely used RS corpora and UAV collections. We design four task families: multiple-choice VQA, open-ended VQA, image captioning, and single-image evaluation. These tasks cover nine perception categories and four reasoning types, supporting multi-turn and multi-image dialog. To reduce reliance on language priors, we apply adversarial filtering with strong LLMs followed by rigorous human verification. Overall, we construct 3,864 VQA tasks, 3,913 image captioning tasks, and 500 fully human-written or verified single-image evaluation VQA pairs. Evaluations across open-source, closed-source, and RS-specific VLMs reveal persistent performance gaps in super-high-resolution scenarios. Code: https://github.com/Yunkaidang/RSHR

Motivation: 现有引导技术在负样本的粒度和难度控制上缺乏可靠性，且目标层选择固定，难以有效暴露细微缺陷以优化生成质量。

Method: 提出基于统计自适应层选择的指数移动平均引导（EMAG），在扩散变换器推理时动态调整注意力机制，生成细粒度降级的负样本以增强模型对细微瑕疵的修正能力。

Result: 相比CFG，EMAG在人类偏好评分（HPS）上提升0.46；能自然融合APG和CADS等方法，进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: EMAG是一种训练-free的高效引导机制，通过自适应生成高质量负样本，显著提升生成质量，具备良好的扩展性与实用性。

Abstract: In diffusion and flow-matching generative models, guidance techniques are widely used to improve sample quality and consistency. Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the de facto choice in modern systems and achieves this by contrasting conditional and unconditional samples. Recent work explores contrasting negative samples at inference using a weaker model, via strong/weak model pairs, attention-based masking, stochastic block dropping, or perturbations to the self-attention energy landscape. While these strategies refine the generation quality, they still lack reliable control over the granularity or difficulty of the negative samples, and target-layer selection is often fixed. We propose Exponential Moving Average Guidance (EMAG), a training-free mechanism that modifies attention at inference time in diffusion transformers, with a statistics-based, adaptive layer-selection rule. Unlike prior methods, EMAG produces harder, semantically faithful negatives (fine-grained degradations), surfacing difficult failure modes, enabling the denoiser to refine subtle artifacts, boosting the quality and human preference score (HPS) by +0.46 over CFG. We further demonstrate that EMAG naturally composes with advanced guidance techniques, such as APG and CADS, further improving HPS.

TL;DR: DRIM 是一种新型视觉语言模型，通过多轮工具调用和自我反思机制，在复杂视觉任务中实现深度且可靠的链式思维（CoT）。该模型分为数据构建、冷启动监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）三个阶段。首先基于高分辨率图像数据集构建高难度、可验证的视觉问答对；其次在 SFT 阶段利用工具轨迹作为初始训练数据，引导多轮推理模式；最后在 RL 阶段引入冗余惩罚策略优化，鼓励模型进行多尺度探索并自我纠正错误推理路径。实验表明，DRIM 在多个视觉理解基准上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在复杂视觉任务中虽具备较强推理能力，但缺乏自我反思与纠错能力，容易陷入错误推理路径而无法修正。因此需要一种能够支持多轮深度推理并具备自省能力的模型架构。

Result: DRIM 在多个视觉理解基准测试中均取得优于现有方法的性能，尤其在复杂、需多步推理的任务上表现出更强的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DRIM 有效提升了视觉语言模型在多轮链式思维中的深度与可靠性，通过引入自我反思机制和冗余惩罚策略，显著增强了模型在复杂视觉任务中的推理能力与纠错能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have exhibited strong reasoning capabilities on complex visual tasks by thinking with images in their Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which is achieved by actively invoking tools to analyze visual inputs rather than merely perceiving them. However, existing models often struggle to reflect on and correct themselves when attempting incorrect reasoning trajectories. To address this limitation, we propose DRIM, a model that enables deep but reliable multi-turn reasoning when thinking with images in its multimodal CoT. Our pipeline comprises three stages: data construction, cold-start SFT and RL. Based on a high-resolution image dataset, we construct high-difficulty and verifiable visual question-answer pairs, where solving each task requires multi-turn tool calls to reach the correct answer. In the SFT stage, we collect tool trajectories as cold-start data, guiding a multi-turn reasoning pattern. In the RL stage, we introduce redundancy-penalized policy optimization, which incentivizes the model to develop a self-reflective reasoning pattern. The basic idea is to impose judgment on reasoning trajectories and penalize those that produce incorrect answers without sufficient multi-scale exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRIM achieves superior performance on visual understanding benchmarks.

### [35] [CodeDance: A Dynamic Tool-integrated MLLM for Executable Visual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17312)
*Qi Song,Honglin Li,Yingchen Yu,Haoyi Zhou,Lin Yang,Song Bai,Qi She,Zilong Huang,Yunqing Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CodeDance introduces executable code as a general solver for visual reasoning, enabling flexible, interpretable, and transferable problem-solving across tasks. It uses adaptive tool calls guided by a reward mechanism, leading to emergent behaviors like novel tool usage and cross-task transfer without fine-tuning. Experiments show it outperforms both open-source baselines and advanced closed models like GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source visual reasoning methods are limited by rigid schemas, text-only chains, or single-step pipelines, which hinder flexibility, interpretability, and transferability. There is a need for a more adaptable and transparent approach to complex visual reasoning tasks.

Method: CodeDance leverages executable code to orchestrate multiple tools, compute intermediate results, and generate visual artifacts (e.g., boxes, plots). It employs a reward mechanism to balance exploration and efficiency in tool usage, enabling adaptive and self-checkable reasoning during reinforcement learning training.

Result: CodeDance demonstrates superior performance on diverse benchmarks including visual search, math, and chart QA. It not only surpasses existing open-source models but also exceeds advanced closed models like GPT-4o. Notably, it exhibits emergent behaviors such as novel tool invocations, unseen compositions, and cross-task transfer without task-specific tuning.

Conclusion: Executable code provides a powerful, general-purpose framework for visual reasoning. CodeDance enables flexible, interpretable, and scalable reasoning with emergent capabilities, offering a promising direction for future AI systems in complex, real-world tasks.

Abstract: Recent releases such as o3 highlight human-like "thinking with images" reasoning that combines structured tool use with stepwise verification, yet most open-source approaches still rely on text-only chains, rigid visual schemas, or single-step pipelines, limiting flexibility, interpretability, and transferability on complex tasks. We introduce CodeDance, which explores executable code as a general solver for visual reasoning. Unlike fixed-schema calls (e.g., only predicting bounding-box coordinates), CodeDance defines, composes, and executes code to orchestrate multiple tools, compute intermediate results, and render visual artifacts (e.g., boxes, lines, plots) that support transparent, self-checkable reasoning. To guide this process, we introduce a reward for balanced and adaptive tool-call, which balances exploration with efficiency and mitigates tool overuse. Interestingly, beyond the expected capabilities taught by atomic supervision, we empirically observe novel emergent behaviors during RL training: CodeDance demonstrates novel tool invocations, unseen compositions, and cross-task transfer. These behaviors arise without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting a general and scalable mechanism of executable visual reasoning. Extensive experiments across reasoning benchmarks (e.g., visual search, math, chart QA) show that CodeDance not only consistently outperforms schema-driven and text-only baselines, but also surpasses advanced closed models such as GPT-4o and larger open-source models.

### [36] [Auxiliary Descriptive Knowledge for Few-Shot Adaptation of Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17313)
*SuBeen Lee,GilHan Park,WonJun Moon,Hyun Seok Seong,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种名为辅助描述知识（ADK）的新框架，用于提升视觉-语言模型（VLM）在少样本适应任务中的表现。ADK通过大语言模型离线生成每个类别的丰富描述性提示，并以两种方式部署：一是组合知识（平均表示），增强语义表达，尤其适用于类别名称对VLM不直观的情况；二是实例特定知识，通过轻量级非参数注意力机制动态选择最相关描述。该方法无需额外参数，可无缝集成至现有参数高效微调（PEFT）方法中，显著提升性能并实现跨领域分类能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉-语言模型在下游任务中面临分布偏移问题，尽管少样本适应（FSA-VLM）结合参数高效微调（PEFT）有所进展，但其依赖固定手写提示，难以充分理解类别语义。已有图像引导提示虽有效，但推理时计算开销过大。因此需要一种高效且能增强文本表示的方法。

Method: ADK首先利用大语言模型离线生成每个类别的多样化描述提示；随后将这些预计算特征以两种形式使用：1）组合知识——通过平均生成统一的语义表示；2）实例特定知识——采用轻量级非参数注意力机制，为每张图像动态选择最相关的描述。该框架为现有PEFT方法提供无参数、即插即用的知识增强。

Result: 大量实验表明，ADK在多个PEFT基线方法上均显著提升性能，且在不同场景下达到新的最佳水平，验证了其有效性与通用性。

Conclusion: ADK是一种高效、灵活且可扩展的框架，通过引入离线生成的丰富描述知识，显著增强了视觉-语言模型在少样本适应任务中的表现，同时保持了推理效率，为未来模型泛化能力提升提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite the impressive zero-shot capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), they often struggle in downstream tasks with distribution shifts from the pre-training data. Few-Shot Adaptation (FSA-VLM) has emerged as a key solution, typically using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to adapt models with minimal data. However, these PEFT methods are constrained by their reliance on fixed, handcrafted prompts, which are often insufficient to understand the semantics of classes. While some studies have proposed leveraging image-induced prompts to provide additional clues for classification, they introduce prohibitive computational overhead at inference. Therefore, we introduce Auxiliary Descriptive Knowledge (ADK), a novel framework that efficiently enriches text representations without compromising efficiency. ADK first leverages a Large Language Model to generate a rich set of descriptive prompts for each class offline. These pre-computed features are then deployed in two ways: (1) as Compositional Knowledge, an averaged representation that provides rich semantics, especially beneficial when class names are ambiguous or unfamiliar to the VLM; and (2) as Instance-Specific Knowledge, where a lightweight, non-parametric attention mechanism dynamically selects the most relevant descriptions for a given image. This approach provides two additional types of knowledge alongside the handcrafted prompt, thereby facilitating category distinction across various domains. Also, ADK acts as a parameter-free, plug-and-play component that enhances existing PEFT methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADK consistently boosts the performance of multiple PEFT baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art across various scenarios.

### [37] [EMMA: Concept Erasure Benchmark with Comprehensive Semantic Metrics and Diverse Categories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17320)
*Lu Wei,Yuta Nakashima,Noa Garcia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EMMA is a benchmark introduced to rigorously evaluate concept erasure techniques in text-to-image generation models across five domains and 12 metrics, focusing on robustness under indirect prompts, visual similarity, and social biases. Existing methods fail in handling implicit references and similar non-target concepts, and some exacerbate gender and ethnicity bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current evaluations of concept erasure methods, which rely on simple, direct prompts and lack comprehensive testing under realistic and challenging conditions, including indirect descriptions and potential societal biases.

Method: EMMA evaluates five concept erasure methods across five domains (objects, celebrities, art styles, NSFW, copyright) using 12 metrics that assess image quality, time efficiency, robustness to indirect prompts, visual similarity with non-target concepts, and fairness regarding gender and ethnicity.

Result: Existing concept erasure methods struggle with generating erased concepts when indirectly referenced and fail to avoid generating visually similar non-target concepts. Additionally, some methods worsen gender and ethnicity bias compared to the original model.

Conclusion: Current concept erasure techniques are not robust enough for real-world applications; improved evaluation benchmarks like EMMA are essential to guide future research toward more reliable and socially responsible methods.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of text-to-image (T2I) generation has raised concerns about privacy, bias, and copyright violations. Concept erasure techniques offer a promising solution by selectively removing undesired concepts from pre-trained models without requiring full retraining. However, these methods are often evaluated on a limited set of concepts, relying on overly simplistic and direct prompts. To test the boundaries of concept erasure techniques, and assess whether they truly remove targeted concepts from model representations, we introduce EMMA, a benchmark that evaluates five key dimensions of concept erasure over 12 metrics. EMMA goes beyond standard metrics like image quality and time efficiency, testing robustness under challenging conditions, including indirect descriptions, visually similar non-target concepts, and potential gender and ethnicity bias, providing a socially aware analysis of method behavior. Using EMMA, we analyze five concept erasure methods across five domains (objects, celebrities, art styles, NSFW, and copyright). Our results show that existing methods struggle with implicit prompts (i.e., generating the erased concept when it is indirectly referenced) and visually similar non-target concepts (i.e., failing to generate non-targeted concepts resembling the erased one), while some amplify gender and ethnicity bias compared to the original model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InsertAnywhere 提出了一种新的视频对象插入（VOI）框架，通过4D感知的掩码生成和扩散模型联合生成物体及其周围光照、阴影等局部变化，实现几何一致且外观忠实的视频合成。引入了 ROSE++ 数据集用于监督训练，显著优于现有研究与商业模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散的视频生成在可控视频编辑方面取得进展，但真实场景下的视频对象插入仍面临4D场景理解不足、遮挡与光照处理不佳的挑战。

Method: 提出4D感知掩码生成模块以重建场景几何并跨帧传播用户指定的对象位置，保持时间一致性与遮挡一致性；扩展扩散视频生成模型，联合生成插入对象及其周围环境变化如光照与阴影；构建ROSE++数据集，由ROSE去对象数据集转换而来，包含移除对象视频、存在对象视频及VLM生成参考图像三元组。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在多种真实场景下能生成几何合理、视觉连贯的对象插入效果，显著优于现有方法与商业模型。

Conclusion: InsertAnywhere 通过结合4D场景理解与扩散模型，实现了高质量、高一致性的视频对象插入，为可控视频编辑提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have opened new possibilities for controllable video editing, yet realistic video object insertion (VOI) remains challenging due to limited 4D scene understanding and inadequate handling of occlusion and lighting effects. We present InsertAnywhere, a new VOI framework that achieves geometrically consistent object placement and appearance-faithful video synthesis. Our method begins with a 4D aware mask generation module that reconstructs the scene geometry and propagates user specified object placement across frames while maintaining temporal coherence and occlusion consistency. Building upon this spatial foundation, we extend a diffusion based video generation model to jointly synthesize the inserted object and its surrounding local variations such as illumination and shading. To enable supervised training, we introduce ROSE++, an illumination aware synthetic dataset constructed by transforming the ROSE object removal dataset into triplets of object removed video, object present video, and a VLM generated reference image. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework produces geometrically plausible and visually coherent object insertions across diverse real world scenarios, significantly outperforming existing research and commercial models.

Image quality varied widely, including challenging samples typically excluded by automated quality assessment systems, but judged to contain valuable vascular information.
  Conclusion: This dataset offers a rich and heterogeneous source of CFIs with high-quality segmentations. It supports robust benchmarking and training of machine learning models under real-world variability in image quality and acquisition settings.
  Translational Relevance: By including connectivity-validated A/V masks and diverse image conditions, this dataset enables the development of clinically applicable, generalizable machine learning tools for retinal vascular analysis, potentially improving automated screening and diagnosis of systemic and ocular diseases.

### [40] [DESSERT: Diffusion-based Event-driven Single-frame Synthesis via Residual Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17323)
*Jiyun Kong,Jun-Hyuk Kim,Jong-Seok Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DESSERT，一种基于扩散模型的事件驱动单帧合成框架，通过残差训练实现时间一致性。利用预训练的Stable Diffusion模型，结合事件数据与残差对齐，分两阶段训练：事件-残差对齐变分自编码器（ER-VAE）和条件扩散模型。引入多样时长时间增强（DLT），提升鲁棒性。实验表明该方法在事件基重建、图像基视频预测、事件基视频预测及单边事件插值任务中均优于现有方法，生成更清晰、一致的未来帧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频帧预测在动态场景中因缺乏下一帧信息而易产生误差；事件相机虽能提供高时间分辨率的像素亮度变化，但现有方法依赖事件光流估计，常导致孔洞与模糊。因此需要一种更鲁棒且能保持时间一致性的事件驱动帧生成方法。

Method: 提出DESSERT框架，包含两个阶段：(1) 使用事件-残差对齐变分自编码器（ER-VAE）将事件帧与目标帧之间的残差对齐；(2) 利用预训练的Stable Diffusion模型，以事件数据为条件进行残差去噪，生成未来帧。同时引入多样时长时间增强（DLT）策略，提升模型对不同时间跨度输入的适应能力。

Result: 实验结果显示，DESSERT在多个基准上超越现有事件基重建、图像基视频预测、事件基视频预测及单边事件插值方法，在视觉质量、结构清晰度和时间一致性方面均有显著提升，尤其在复杂运动场景下表现优异。

Conclusion: DESSERT通过扩散模型与事件数据联合建模，有效克服了传统事件基帧预测中的失真问题，实现了高质量、高一致性的时间连续帧生成，为事件相机在视频预测领域的应用提供了新范式。

Abstract: Video frame prediction extrapolates future frames from previous frames, but suffers from prediction errors in dynamic scenes due to the lack of information about the next frame. Event cameras address this limitation by capturing per-pixel brightness changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution. Prior research on event-based video frame prediction has leveraged motion information from event data, often by predicting event-based optical flow and reconstructing frames via pixel warping. However, such approaches introduce holes and blurring when pixel displacement is inaccurate. To overcome this limitation, we propose DESSERT, a diffusion-based event-driven single-frame synthesis framework via residual training. Leveraging a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model, our method is trained on inter-frame residuals to ensure temporal consistency. The training pipeline consists of two stages: (1) an Event-to-Residual Alignment Variational Autoencoder (ER-VAE) that aligns the event frame between anchor and target frames with the corresponding residual, and (2) a diffusion model that denoises the residual latent conditioned on event data. Furthermore, we introduce Diverse-Length Temporal (DLT) augmentation, which improves robustness by training on frame segments of varying temporal lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing event-based reconstruction, image-based video frame prediction, event-based video frame prediction, and one-sided event-based video frame interpolation methods, producing sharper and more temporally consistent frame synthesis.

Conclusion: Robust-R1通过显式建模视觉退化与结构化推理链，显著提升了多模态大模型在极端视觉退化下的鲁棒性与可解释性，为实际应用提供了更强的可靠性支持。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models struggle to maintain reliable performance under extreme real-world visual degradations, which impede their practical robustness. Existing robust MLLMs predominantly rely on implicit training/adaptation that focuses solely on visual encoder generalization, suffering from limited interpretability and isolated optimization. To overcome these limitations, we propose Robust-R1, a novel framework that explicitly models visual degradations through structured reasoning chains. Our approach integrates: (i) supervised fine-tuning for degradation-aware reasoning foundations, (ii) reward-driven alignment for accurately perceiving degradation parameters, and (iii) dynamic reasoning depth scaling adapted to degradation intensity. To facilitate this approach, we introduce a specialized 11K dataset featuring realistic degradations synthesized across four critical real-world visual processing stages, each annotated with structured chains connecting degradation parameters, perceptual influence, pristine semantic reasoning chain, and conclusion. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art robustness: Robust-R1 outperforms all general and robust baselines on the real-world degradation benchmark R-Bench, while maintaining superior anti-degradation performance under multi-intensity adversarial degradations on MMMB, MMStar, and RealWorldQA.

Conclusion: 通过构建大规模、标准化的指令数据集HISTAI-Instruct并训练出高性能的视觉语言模型ANTONI-α，为病理学领域实现可解释、可复现、通用的视觉语言模型提供了有效路径。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have the potential to become co-pilots for pathologists. However, most VLMs either focus on small regions of interest within whole-slide images, provide only static slide-level outputs, or rely on data that is not publicly available, limiting reproducibility. Furthermore, training data containing WSIs paired with detailed clinical reports is scarce, restricting progress toward transparent and generalisable VLMs. We address these limitations with three main contributions. First, we introduce Polysome, a standardised tool for synthetic instruction generation. Second, we apply Polysome to the public HISTAI dataset, generating HISTAI-Instruct, a large whole-slide instruction tuning dataset spanning 24,259 slides and over 1.1 million instruction-response pairs. Finally, we use HISTAI-Instruct to train ANTONI-α, a VLM capable of visual-question answering (VQA). We show that ANTONI-α outperforms MedGemma on WSI-level VQA tasks of tissue identification, neoplasm detection, and differential diagnosis. We also compare the performance of multiple incarnations of ANTONI-α trained with different amounts of data. All methods, data, and code are publicly available.

Conclusion: ClothHMR 有效解决了多样化服装下 3D 人体网格重建难题，具备良好的精度与实用性，为真实场景应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: With 3D data rapidly emerging as an important form of multimedia information, 3D human mesh recovery technology has also advanced accordingly. However, current methods mainly focus on handling humans wearing tight clothing and perform poorly when estimating body shapes and poses under diverse clothing, especially loose garments. To this end, we make two key insights: (1) tailoring clothing to fit the human body can mitigate the adverse impact of clothing on 3D human mesh recovery, and (2) utilizing human visual information from large foundational models can enhance the generalization ability of the estimation. Based on these insights, we propose ClothHMR, to accurately recover 3D meshes of humans in diverse clothing. ClothHMR primarily consists of two modules: clothing tailoring (CT) and FHVM-based mesh recovering (MR). The CT module employs body semantic estimation and body edge prediction to tailor the clothing, ensuring it fits the body silhouette. The MR module optimizes the initial parameters of the 3D human mesh by continuously aligning the intermediate representations of the 3D mesh with those inferred from the foundational human visual model (FHVM). ClothHMR can accurately recover 3D meshes of humans wearing diverse clothing, precisely estimating their body shapes and poses. Experimental results demonstrate that ClothHMR significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across benchmark datasets and in-the-wild images. Additionally, a web application for online fashion and shopping powered by ClothHMR is developed, illustrating that ClothHMR can effectively serve real-world usage scenarios. The code and model for ClothHMR are available at: \url{https://github.com/starVisionTeam/ClothHMR}.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统显式变形方法在运动传递和缺失区域恢复上表现不佳，而基于注意力的变形方法虽有效但计算复杂且几何基础弱，因此需要一种兼顾精度与效率的新型方法。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1）使用3D密集光流进行粗略空间对齐；2）通过跨注意力机制结合多参考图像的关键点与纹理特征，补全遮挡或失真区域；3）基于学习的置信图实现空间自适应融合，平衡结构对齐与视觉一致性。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上达到当前最优性能，显著提升动画质量与几何一致性。

Conclusion: SynergyWarpNet通过注意力引导的协同变形机制，在保持高效性的同时实现了高质量的说话头合成，为虚拟形象和数字内容创作提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural portrait animation have demonstrated remarked potential for applications in virtual avatars, telepresence, and digital content creation. However, traditional explicit warping approaches often struggle with accurate motion transfer or recovering missing regions, while recent attention-based warping methods, though effective, frequently suffer from high complexity and weak geometric grounding. To address these issues, we propose SynergyWarpNet, an attention-guided cooperative warping framework designed for high-fidelity talking head synthesis. Given a source portrait, a driving image, and a set of reference images, our model progressively refines the animation in three stages. First, an explicit warping module performs coarse spatial alignment between the source and driving image using 3D dense optical flow. Next, a reference-augmented correction module leverages cross-attention across 3D keypoints and texture features from multiple reference images to semantically complete occluded or distorted regions. Finally, a confidence-guided fusion module integrates the warped outputs with spatially-adaptive fusing, using a learned confidence map to balance structural alignment and visual consistency. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are important for diagnosis, treatment planning and monitoring of brain tumors. Depending on the brain tumor type, the FLAIR hyperintensity volume is an important measure to asses the tumor volume or surrounding edema, and an automatic segmentation of this would be useful in the clinic. In this study, around 5000 FLAIR images of various tumors types and acquisition time points from different centers were used to train a unified FLAIR hyperintensity segmentation model using an Attention U-Net architecture. The performance was compared against dataset specific models, and was validated on different tumor types, acquisition time points and against BraTS. The unified model achieved an average Dice score of 88.65\% for pre-operative meningiomas, 80.08% for pre-operative metastasis, 90.92% for pre-operative and 84.60% for post-operative gliomas from BraTS, and 84.47% for pre-operative and 61.27\% for post-operative lower grade gliomas. In addition, the results showed that the unified model achieved comparable segmentation performance to the dataset specific models on their respective datasets, and enables generalization across tumor types and acquisition time points, which facilitates the deployment in a clinical setting. The model is integrated into Raidionics, an open-source software for CNS tumor analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种简单的像素级映射预处理方法，通过破坏图像的像素值分布，消除检测器对源特定语义线索的依赖，使其聚焦于更本质、通用的高频生成痕迹，从而显著提升现有检测器在跨生成模型上的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI图像检测器难以泛化到未见过的生成模型，因其过度依赖特定源的语义线索而非学习通用生成特征。

Method: 引入像素级映射预处理步骤，扰乱图像像素值分布，破坏非必要语义模式，迫使检测器关注生成过程中的高频特征。

Result: 在GAN和扩散模型生成的图像上，该方法显著提升了检测器的跨生成模型性能；实验验证了破坏语义线索是实现泛化性的关键。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了检测器的泛化能力，为应对生成技术快速演进提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative technologies necessitates reliable methods for detecting AI-generated images. A critical limitation of current detectors is their failure to generalize to images from unseen generative models, as they often overfit to source-specific semantic cues rather than learning universal generative artifacts. To overcome this, we introduce a simple yet remarkably effective pixel-level mapping pre-processing step to disrupt the pixel value distribution of images and break the fragile, non-essential semantic patterns that detectors commonly exploit as shortcuts. This forces the detector to focus on more fundamental and generalizable high-frequency traces inherent to the image generation process. Through comprehensive experiments on GAN and diffusion-based generators, we show that our approach significantly boosts the cross-generator performance of state-of-the-art detectors. Extensive analysis further verifies our hypothesis that the disruption of semantic cues is the key to generalization.

Abstract: Robust mammography registration is essential for clinical applications like tracking disease progression and monitoring longitudinal changes in breast tissue. However, progress has been limited by the absence of public datasets and standardized benchmarks. Existing studies are often not directly comparable, as they use private data and inconsistent evaluation frameworks. To address this, we present MGRegBench, a public benchmark dataset for mammogram registration. It comprises over 5,000 image pairs, with 100 containing manual anatomical landmarks and segmentation masks for rigorous evaluation. This makes MGRegBench one of the largest public 2D registration datasets with manual annotations. Using this resource, we benchmarked diverse registration methods including classical (ANTs), learning-based (VoxelMorph, TransMorph), implicit neural representation (IDIR), a classic mammography-specific approach, and a recent state-of-the-art deep learning method MammoRegNet. The implementations were adapted to this modality from the authors' implementations or re-implemented from scratch. Our contributions are: (1) the first public dataset of this scale with manual landmarks and masks for mammography registration; (2) the first like-for-like comparison of diverse methods on this modality; and (3) an extensive analysis of deep learning-based registration. We publicly release our code and data to establish a foundational resource for fair comparisons and catalyze future research.

Abstract: Social media platforms enable users to express emotions by posting text with accompanying images. In this paper, we propose the Affective Image Filter (AIF) task, which aims to reflect visually-abstract emotions from text into visually-concrete images, thereby creating emotionally compelling results. We first introduce the AIF dataset and the formulation of the AIF models. Then, we present AIF-B as an initial attempt based on a multi-modal transformer architecture. After that, we propose AIF-D as an extension of AIF-B towards deeper emotional reflection, effectively leveraging generative priors from pre-trained large-scale diffusion models. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that AIF models achieve superior performance for both content consistency and emotional fidelity compared to state-of-the-art methods. Extensive user study experiments demonstrate that AIF models are significantly more effective at evoking specific emotions. Based on the presented results, we comprehensively discuss the value and potential of AIF models.

Abstract: Accurate flood detection from visual data is a critical step toward improving disaster response and risk assessment, yet datasets for flood segmentation remain scarce due to the challenges of collecting and annotating large-scale imagery. Existing resources are often limited in geographic scope and annotation detail, hindering the development of robust, generalized computer vision methods. To bridge this gap, we introduce AIFloodSense, a comprehensive, publicly available aerial imagery dataset comprising 470 high-resolution images from 230 distinct flood events across 64 countries and six continents. Unlike prior benchmarks, AIFloodSense ensures global diversity and temporal relevance (2022-2024), supporting three complementary tasks: (i) Image Classification with novel sub-tasks for environment type, camera angle, and continent recognition; (ii) Semantic Segmentation providing precise pixel-level masks for flood, sky, and buildings; and (iii) Visual Question Answering (VQA) to enable natural language reasoning for disaster assessment. We establish baseline benchmarks for all tasks using state-of-the-art architectures, demonstrating the dataset's complexity and its value in advancing domain-generalized AI tools for climate resilience.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究通过在FFHQ超分辨率任务上的实证消融实验，发现条件化步骤的步长对性能影响远大于扩散步骤数量，步长在[2.0, 3.0]范围内表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有条件化方法（如DPS和MCG）虽能提升重建质量，但引入需精细调优的超参数，亟需明确关键影响因素以优化应用效果。

Method: 在FFHQ数据集上进行超分辨率任务的实证消融实验，系统评估不同条件化步长与扩散步骤数量对重建性能的影响。

Result: 实验表明，条件化步长是决定性能的关键因素，步长在[2.0, 3.0]区间时取得最优结果，而扩散步骤数量的影响相对较小。

Conclusion: 在将条件化应用于预训练扩散模型时，应优先关注并优化条件化步长，而非过度关注扩散步骤数量，这为实际应用提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong potential for solving inverse problems such as single-image super-resolution, where a high-resolution image is recovered from a low-resolution observation using a pretrained unconditional prior. Conditioning methods, including Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) and Manifold Constrained Gradient (MCG), can substantially improve reconstruction quality, but they introduce additional hyperparameters that require careful tuning. In this work, we conduct an empirical ablation study on FFHQ super-resolution to identify the dominant factors affecting performance when applying conditioning to pretrained diffusion models, and show that the conditioning step size has a significantly greater impact than the diffusion step count, with step sizes in the range of [2.0, 3.0] yielding the best overall performance in our experiments.

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is critical in diagnosis and treatment planning for the disease. Yet, current deep learning methods rely on centralized data collection, which raises privacy concerns and limits generalization across diverse institutions. In this paper, we propose TwinSegNet, which is a privacy-preserving federated learning framework that integrates a hybrid ViT-UNet model with personalized digital twins for accurate and real-time brain tumor segmentation. Our architecture combines convolutional encoders with Vision Transformer bottlenecks to capture local and global context. Each institution fine-tunes the global model of private data to form its digital twin. Evaluated on nine heterogeneous MRI datasets, including BraTS 2019-2021 and custom tumor collections, TwinSegNet achieves high Dice scores (up to 0.90%) and sensitivity/specificity exceeding 90%, demonstrating robustness across non-independent and identically distributed (IID) client distributions. Comparative results against centralized models such as TumorVisNet highlight TwinSegNet's effectiveness in preserving privacy without sacrificing performance. Our approach enables scalable, personalized segmentation for multi-institutional clinical settings while adhering to strict data confidentiality requirements.

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) models have demonstrated remarkable progress in creative image generation, yet they still lack precise control over scene illuminants, which is a crucial factor for content designers aiming to manipulate the mood, atmosphere, and visual aesthetics of generated images. In this paper, we present an illuminant personalization method named LumiCtrl that learns an illuminant prompt given a single image of an object. LumiCtrl consists of three basic components: given an image of the object, our method applies (a) physics-based illuminant augmentation along the Planckian locus to create fine-tuning variants under standard illuminants; (b) edge-guided prompt disentanglement using a frozen ControlNet to ensure prompts focus on illumination rather than structure; and (c) a masked reconstruction loss that focuses learning on the foreground object while allowing the background to adapt contextually, enabling what we call contextual light adaptation. We qualitatively and quantitatively compare LumiCtrl against other T2I customization methods. The results show that our method achieves significantly better illuminant fidelity, aesthetic quality, and scene coherence compared to existing personalization baselines. A human preference study further confirms strong user preference for LumiCtrl outputs. The code and data will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Geo-spatial analysis of our world benefits from a multimodal approach, as every single geographic location can be described in numerous ways (images from various viewpoints, textual descriptions, and geographic coordinates). Current geo-spatial benchmarks have limited coverage across modalities, considerably restricting progress in the field, as current approaches cannot integrate all relevant modalities within a unified framework. We introduce the Multi-Modal Landmark dataset (MMLANDMARKS), a benchmark composed of four modalities: 197k highresolution aerial images, 329k ground-view images, textual information, and geographic coordinates for 18,557 distinct landmarks in the United States. The MMLANDMARKS dataset has a one-to-one correspondence across every modality, which enables training and benchmarking models for various geo-spatial tasks, including cross-view Ground-to-Satellite retrieval, ground and satellite geolocalization, Text-to-Image, and Text-to-GPS retrieval. We demonstrate broad generalization and competitive performance against off-the-shelf foundational models and specialized state-of-the-art models across different tasks by employing a simple CLIP-inspired baseline, illustrating the necessity for multimodal datasets to achieve broad geo-spatial understanding.

Abstract: Recent advances in world models have greatly enhanced interactive environment simulation. Existing methods mainly fall into two categories: (1) static world generation models, which construct 3D environments without active agents, and (2) controllable-entity models, which allow a single entity to perform limited actions in an otherwise uncontrollable environment. In this work, we introduce AniX, leveraging the realism and structural grounding of static world generation while extending controllable-entity models to support user-specified characters capable of performing open-ended actions. Users can provide a 3DGS scene and a character, then direct the character through natural language to perform diverse behaviors from basic locomotion to object-centric interactions while freely exploring the environment. AniX synthesizes temporally coherent video clips that preserve visual fidelity with the provided scene and character, formulated as a conditional autoregressive video generation problem. Built upon a pre-trained video generator, our training strategy significantly enhances motion dynamics while maintaining generalization across actions and characters. Our evaluation covers a broad range of aspects, including visual quality, character consistency, action controllability, and long-horizon coherence.

Motivation: 现有基准无法反映真实世界复杂性，难以评估多模态大模型是否具备类人视觉定位能力，尤其在处理模糊引用和不可定位查询方面存在盲区。

Method: 构建GroundingME基准，结合自动化生成与人工验证，设计1005个高难度样本，涵盖四大挑战维度：判别性、空间性、局限性与拒绝性。对25个主流多模态大模型进行评估，并探索测试时缩放与数据混合训练两种改进策略。

Result: 最先进模型在基准上最高准确率为45.1%，多数模型在拒绝任务中准确率为0%，表现出显著的幻觉倾向；通过数据混合训练，拒绝准确率从0%提升至27.9%；测试时缩放使复杂定位性能提升最多2.9%。

Conclusion: GroundingME揭示了当前多模态大模型在真实世界视觉定位任务中的根本性局限，为实现人类级视觉定位提供了诊断工具与改进路径。

Abstract: Visual grounding, localizing objects from natural language descriptions, represents a critical bridge between language and vision understanding. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve impressive scores on existing benchmarks, a fundamental question remains: can MLLMs truly ground language in vision with human-like sophistication, or are they merely pattern-matching on simplified datasets? Current benchmarks fail to capture real-world complexity where humans effortlessly navigate ambiguous references and recognize when grounding is impossible. To rigorously assess MLLMs' true capabilities, we introduce GroundingME, a benchmark that systematically challenges models across four critical dimensions: (1) Discriminative, distinguishing highly similar objects, (2) Spatial, understanding complex relational descriptions, (3) Limited, handling occlusions or tiny objects, and (4) Rejection, recognizing ungroundable queries. Through careful curation combining automated generation with human verification, we create 1,005 challenging examples mirroring real-world complexity. Evaluating 25 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a profound capability gap: the best model achieves only 45.1% accuracy, while most score 0% on rejection tasks, reflexively hallucinating objects rather than acknowledging their absence, raising critical safety concerns for deployment. We explore two strategies for improvements: (1) test-time scaling selects optimal response by thinking trajectory to improve complex grounding by up to 2.9%, and (2) data-mixture training teaches models to recognize ungroundable queries, boosting rejection accuracy from 0% to 27.9%. GroundingME thus serves as both a diagnostic tool revealing current limitations in MLLMs and a roadmap toward human-level visual grounding.

Conclusion: AI模型在前列腺组织病理学评估中表现出与病理学家相当的性能。紧凑型扫描仪可作为非数字化环境中验证研究的有效工具，并促进资源有限实验室中成本效益高的AI部署。本研究发布的中东首个公开数字病理数据集将推动全球公平的AI病理学研究。

Abstract: Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is improving the efficiency and accuracy of cancer diagnostics. The performance of pathology AI systems has been almost exclusively evaluated on European and US cohorts from large centers. For global AI adoption in pathology, validation studies on currently under-represented populations - where the potential gains from AI support may also be greatest - are needed. We present the first study with an external validation cohort from the Middle East, focusing on AI-based diagnosis and Gleason grading of prostate cancer.
  Methods: We collected and digitised 339 prostate biopsy specimens from the Kurdistan region, Iraq, representing a consecutive series of 185 patients spanning the period 2013-2024. We evaluated a task-specific end-to-end AI model and two foundation models in terms of their concordance with pathologists and consistency across samples digitised on three scanner models (Hamamatsu, Leica, and Grundium).
  Findings: Grading concordance between AI and pathologists was similar to pathologist-pathologist concordance with Cohen's quadratically weighted kappa 0.801 vs. 0.799 (p=0.9824). Cross-scanner concordance was high (quadratically weighted kappa > 0.90) for all AI models and scanner pairs, including low-cost compact scanner.
  Interpretation: AI models demonstrated pathologist-level performance in prostate histopathology assessment. Compact scanners can provide a route for validation studies in non-digitalised settings and enable cost-effective adoption of AI in laboratories with limited sample volumes. This first openly available digital pathology dataset from the Middle East supports further research into globally equitable AI pathology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶系统依赖多传感器融合，但真实雷达数据采集成本高、规模有限。现有方法难以生成具有物理合理性的雷达点云，限制了多模态仿真系统的泛化能力。因此，亟需一种高效、可扩展的雷达数据生成方法，以实现与视觉数据协同的生成式仿真。

Method: RadarGen 采用高效的图像-潜在扩散模型架构，将雷达测量转化为鸟瞰图（BEV）形式，编码空间结构、雷达截面（RCS）和多普勒信息；引入轻量级解码器从生成的BEV图重建点云；结合预训练模型提取的BEV对齐深度、语义与运动特征作为条件，引导扩散过程生成与视觉场景一致的雷达模式。

Abstract: We present RadarGen, a diffusion model for synthesizing realistic automotive radar point clouds from multi-view camera imagery. RadarGen adapts efficient image-latent diffusion to the radar domain by representing radar measurements in bird's-eye-view form that encodes spatial structure together with radar cross section (RCS) and Doppler attributes. A lightweight recovery step reconstructs point clouds from the generated maps. To better align generation with the visual scene, RadarGen incorporates BEV-aligned depth, semantic, and motion cues extracted from pretrained foundation models, which guide the stochastic generation process toward physically plausible radar patterns. Conditioning on images makes the approach broadly compatible, in principle, with existing visual datasets and simulation frameworks, offering a scalable direction for multimodal generative simulation. Evaluations on large-scale driving data show that RadarGen captures characteristic radar measurement distributions and reduces the gap to perception models trained on real data, marking a step toward unified generative simulation across sensing modalities.

### [59] [Adversarial Robustness of Vision in Open Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17902)
*Jonathon Fox,William J Buchanan,Pavlos Papadopoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了LLaVA-1.5-13B和Meta的Llama 3.2 Vision-8B-2在面对未定向PGD攻击时的对抗鲁棒性，基于VQA v2数据集子集进行实验。结果显示，尽管Llama 3.2 Vision基线准确率较低，但在高扰动水平下性能下降更小，表明视觉模态是攻击开放权重视觉语言模型的有效途径。研究还发现，标准基准表现与对抗鲁棒性之间无直接关联，受架构和训练因素影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习的发展，理解AI系统如何识别物体变得愈发困难，使得对手可通过添加未见过的元素来干扰模型识别，因此需要研究当前视觉语言模型的对抗鲁棒性。

Method: 采用未定向投影梯度下降（PGD）攻击方法，针对视觉输入模态对LLaVA-1.5-13B和Llama 3.2 Vision-8B-2进行测试，并在VQA v2数据集子集上进行实证评估，使用标准VQA准确率量化攻击效果，对比两者在攻击下的准确率下降情况。

Result: Llama 3.2 Vision在较高扰动水平下表现出更小的准确率下降，尽管其基线准确率低于LLaVA；这表明视觉模态是有效的攻击向量，且对抗鲁棒性与标准性能不直接相关。

Conclusion: 视觉模态是攻击现代开放权重视觉语言模型的可行路径，对抗鲁棒性受模型架构和训练机制影响，不能仅通过基准性能判断。

Abstract: With the increase in deep learning, it becomes increasingly difficult to understand the model in which AI systems can identify objects. Thus, an adversary could aim to modify an image by adding unseen elements, which will confuse the AI in its recognition of an entity. This paper thus investigates the adversarial robustness of LLaVA-1.5-13B and Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision-8B-2. These are tested for untargeted PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) against the visual input modality, and empirically evaluated on the Visual Question Answering (VQA) v2 dataset subset. The results of these adversarial attacks are then quantified using the standard VQA accuracy metric. This evaluation is then compared with the accuracy degradation (accuracy drop) of LLaVA and Llama 3.2 Vision. A key finding is that Llama 3.2 Vision, despite a lower baseline accuracy in this setup, exhibited a smaller drop in performance under attack compared to LLaVA, particularly at higher perturbation levels. Overall, the findings confirm that the vision modality represents a viable attack vector for degrading the performance of contemporary open-weight VLMs, including Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision. Furthermore, they highlight that adversarial robustness does not necessarily correlate directly with standard benchmark performance and may be influenced by underlying architectural and training factors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型如深度任意V2在真实世界图像上表现不佳，主要因为训练分布与实际场景存在显著差异。如何有效缓解这种领域差距，提升模型在未见场景下的泛化能力，是当前单目深度估计的关键挑战。

Method: 提出Re-Depth Anything框架，结合DA-V2与大规模2D扩散模型的先验知识；通过重光照预测深度图并增强输入，使用基于得分蒸馏采样的生成式方法替代传统光度重建；采用冻结编码器、仅优化中间嵌入和微调解码器的策略以避免优化崩溃。

Conclusion: Re-Depth Anything 通过融合生成式先验与自监督优化，成功缓解了单目深度估计中的领域偏移问题，为未来基于生成模型的几何推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation remains challenging as recent foundation models, such as Depth Anything V2 (DA-V2), struggle with real-world images that are far from the training distribution. We introduce Re-Depth Anything, a test-time self-supervision framework that bridges this domain gap by fusing DA-V2 with the powerful priors of large-scale 2D diffusion models. Our method performs label-free refinement directly on the input image by re-lighting predicted depth maps and augmenting the input. This re-synthesis method replaces classical photometric reconstruction by leveraging shape from shading (SfS) cues in a new, generative context with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). To prevent optimization collapse, our framework employs a targeted optimization strategy: rather than optimizing depth directly or fine-tuning the full model, we freeze the encoder and only update intermediate embeddings while also fine-tuning the decoder. Across diverse benchmarks, Re-Depth Anything yields substantial gains in depth accuracy and realism over the DA-V2, showcasing new avenues for self-supervision by augmenting geometric reasoning.

### [61] [G3Splat: Geometrically Consistent Generalizable Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17547)
*Mehdi Hosseinzadeh,Shin-Fang Chng,Yi Xu,Simon Lucey,Ian Reid,Ravi Garg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D Gaussians are effective for real-time scene rendering and view synthesis, but existing methods relying solely on view-synthesis supervision struggle with geometric accuracy. This paper proposes G3Splat, which introduces geometric priors to improve consistency in 3D scene representation. It achieves state-of-the-art results in reconstruction, pose estimation, and novel-view synthesis, with strong zero-shot generalization on ScanNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use view-synthesis loss alone to predict 3D Gaussians, but this leads to geometrically inconsistent results due to ambiguities in self-supervised learning. The need arises to incorporate geometric priors to ensure meaningful 3D structure recovery without requiring explicit poses.

Method: G3Splat introduces geometric constraints during training to enforce consistency in 3D Gaussian splats. It leverages a self-supervised framework with added geometric priors to guide the prediction of orientation, scale, opacity, and appearance, improving both geometry and view synthesis quality.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometrically consistent reconstruction, relative pose estimation, and novel-view synthesis on RE10K. It also shows superior zero-shot generalization on ScanNet, outperforming prior approaches in both geometry recovery and pose estimation.

Conclusion: By enforcing geometric priors in a self-supervised setting, G3Splat enables robust, pose-free 3D scene representation with high fidelity and strong generalization, demonstrating significant improvements over previous methods.

Abstract: 3D Gaussians have recently emerged as an effective scene representation for real-time splatting and accurate novel-view synthesis, motivating several works to adapt multi-view structure prediction networks to regress per-pixel 3D Gaussians from images. However, most prior work extends these networks to predict additional Gaussian parameters -- orientation, scale, opacity, and appearance -- while relying almost exclusively on view-synthesis supervision. We show that a view-synthesis loss alone is insufficient to recover geometrically meaningful splats in this setting. We analyze and address the ambiguities of learning 3D Gaussian splats under self-supervision for pose-free generalizable splatting, and introduce G3Splat, which enforces geometric priors to obtain geometrically consistent 3D scene representations. Trained on RE10K, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in (i) geometrically consistent reconstruction, (ii) relative pose estimation, and (iii) novel-view synthesis. We further demonstrate strong zero-shot generalization on ScanNet, substantially outperforming prior work in both geometry recovery and relative pose estimation. Code and pretrained models are released on our project page (https://m80hz.github.io/g3splat/).

Abstract: Virtual furniture synthesis, which seamlessly integrates reference objects into indoor scenes while maintaining geometric coherence and visual realism, holds substantial promise for home design and e-commerce applications. However, this field remains underexplored due to the scarcity of reproducible benchmarks and the limitations of existing image composition methods in achieving high-fidelity furniture synthesis while preserving background integrity. To overcome these challenges, we first present RoomBench++, a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark dataset tailored for this task. It consists of 112,851 training pairs and 1,832 testing pairs drawn from both real-world indoor videos and realistic home design renderings, thereby supporting robust training and evaluation under practical conditions. Then, we propose RoomEditor++, a versatile diffusion-based architecture featuring a parameter-sharing dual diffusion backbone, which is compatible with both U-Net and DiT architectures. This design unifies the feature extraction and inpainting processes for reference and background images. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the parameter-sharing mechanism enforces aligned feature representations, facilitating precise geometric transformations, texture preservation, and seamless integration. Extensive experiments validate that RoomEditor++ is superior over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of quantitative metrics, qualitative assessments, and human preference studies, while highlighting its strong generalization to unseen indoor scenes and general scenes without task-specific fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频压缩感知使用随机二值调制虽有效，但存在时序混叠问题；一热调制可实现理想时序解耦，但缺乏相应重建算法，无法充分发挥其潜力。因此亟需开发适配一热调制特性的新算法以提升重建质量。

Method: 1. 将重建问题建模为生成式视频补全问题，基于一热调制的解耦特性设计与硬件过程一致的前向随机微分方程（SDE）；2. 提出融合一步回归初始化与一步扩散精修的混合框架，克服纯扩散方法在效率与精度上的不足；3. 在硬件端采用双光路设计，利用另一路径的互补信息增强补全效果，减轻一热调制带来的空间退化。

Result: 在合成数据集与真实场景下，所提方法显著优于现有主流算法，在视觉质量、结构相似性（SSIM）和峰值信噪比（PSNR）等方面均有明显提升，验证了其有效性与可行性。

Conclusion: 本工作首次将扩散模型系统性地应用于视频快照压缩感知重建，通过创新的算法设计与双光路硬件架构，成功实现了对一热调制信号的高效高质量重建，为未来高保真动态成像提供了新范式。

Abstract: Video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) captures dynamic scene sequences through a two-dimensional (2D) snapshot, fundamentally relying on optical modulation for hardware compression and the corresponding software reconstruction. While mainstream video SCI using random binary modulation has demonstrated success, it inevitably results in temporal aliasing during compression. One-hot modulation, activating only one sub-frame per pixel, provides a promising solution for achieving perfect temporal decoupling, thereby alleviating issues associated with aliasing. However, no algorithms currently exist to fully exploit this potential. To bridge this gap, we propose an algorithm specifically designed for one-hot masks. First, leveraging the decoupling properties of one-hot modulation, we transform the reconstruction task into a generative video inpainting problem and introduce a stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the forward process that aligns with the hardware compression process. Next, we identify limitations of the pure diffusion method for video SCI and propose a novel framework that combines one-step regression initialization with one-step diffusion refinement. Furthermore, to mitigate the spatial degradation caused by one-hot modulation, we implement a dual optical path at the hardware level, utilizing complementary information from another path to enhance the inpainted video. To our knowledge, this is the first work integrating diffusion into video SCI reconstruction. Experiments conducted on synthetic datasets and real scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Benchmarking competitions are central to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging, defining performance standards and shaping methodological progress. However, it remains unclear whether these benchmarks provide data that are sufficiently representative, accessible, and reusable to support clinically meaningful AI. In this work, we assess fairness along two complementary dimensions: (1) whether challenge datasets are representative of real-world clinical diversity, and (2) whether they are accessible and legally reusable in line with the FAIR principles. To address this question, we conducted a large-scale systematic study of 241 biomedical image analysis challenges comprising 458 tasks across 19 imaging modalities. Our findings show substantial biases in dataset composition, including geographic location, modality-, and problem type-related biases, indicating that current benchmarks do not adequately reflect real-world clinical diversity. Despite their widespread influence, challenge datasets were frequently constrained by restrictive or ambiguous access conditions, inconsistent or non-compliant licensing practices, and incomplete documentation, limiting reproducibility and long-term reuse. Together, these shortcomings expose foundational fairness limitations in our benchmarking ecosystem and highlight a disconnect between leaderboard success and clinical relevance.

### [65] [HeadHunt-VAD: Hunting Robust Anomaly-Sensitive Heads in MLLM for Tuning-Free Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17601)
*Zhaolin Cai,Fan Li,Ziwei Zheng,Haixia Bi,Lijun He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HeadHunt-VAD提出了一种无需微调的视频异常检测方法，通过直接探测冻结的多模态大模型（MLLM）中的敏感注意力头来避免文本生成带来的信息损失和正常性偏差。该方法利用多标准分析识别出一组稳定且具有判别力的稀疏注意力头，结合轻量级异常评分器与时间定位模块，实现高效、准确且可解释的异常检测，在两个主流基准上达到当前最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于MLLM的无微调视频异常检测方法依赖文本输出，存在信息丢失、正常性偏差和提示敏感性问题，难以捕捉细微异常信号，因此需要一种更鲁棒、更高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出HeadHunt-VAD，采用鲁棒头识别模块对所有注意力头进行多维度评估（显著性与稳定性），筛选出在多种提示下均表现一致的判别性稀疏头；提取这些专家头的特征，输入轻量级异常评分器与时间定位器，实现端到端的异常检测。

Result: 在两个主要视频异常检测基准上，HeadHunt-VAD在无需微调的情况下达到当前最优性能，同时保持高效率和可解释性，验证了头部级探查在实际应用中的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过直接挖掘多模态大模型内部的敏感注意力头，HeadHunt-VAD提供了一种强大且实用的无微调视频异常检测新范式，为真实场景下的异常检测提供了高效、可靠的技术路径。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate events that deviate from normal patterns in videos. Traditional approaches often rely on extensive labeled data and incur high computational costs. Recent tuning-free methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising alternative by leveraging their rich world knowledge. However, these methods typically rely on textual outputs, which introduces information loss, exhibits normalcy bias, and suffers from prompt sensitivity, making them insufficient for capturing subtle anomalous cues. To address these constraints, we propose HeadHunt-VAD, a novel tuning-free VAD paradigm that bypasses textual generation by directly hunting robust anomaly-sensitive internal attention heads within the frozen MLLM. Central to our method is a Robust Head Identification module that systematically evaluates all attention heads using a multi-criteria analysis of saliency and stability, identifying a sparse subset of heads that are consistently discriminative across diverse prompts. Features from these expert heads are then fed into a lightweight anomaly scorer and a temporal locator, enabling efficient and accurate anomaly detection with interpretable outputs. Extensive experiments show that HeadHunt-VAD achieves state-of-the-art performance among tuning-free methods on two major VAD benchmarks while maintaining high efficiency, validating head-level probing in MLLMs as a powerful and practical solution for real-world anomaly detection.

*Haiwen Feng,Long Lian,Lisa Dunlap,Jiahao Shu,XuDong Wang,Renhao Wang,Trevor Darrell,Alane Suhr,Angjoo Kanazawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉语言模型（VLM）在视觉提示任务中的评估稳定性问题，发现现有基准测试中微小的视觉提示细节（如标记颜色、大小、图像压缩）会显著影响模型排名。通过实验验证，这些因素甚至能改变强弱模型的相对表现，揭示了当前评估体系的脆弱性。为此，作者构建了包含16种视觉标记变体的更大规模基准VPBench，并公开发布以提升评估可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉提示基准（如BLINK）依赖于视觉标记来引导模型关注特定区域，但研究发现模型表现对这些标记的细微变化极为敏感，导致评估结果不可靠，亟需更稳健的评估方法。

Method: 对比分析九个主流开源与闭源VLM在两种视觉提示任务上的表现，系统考察视觉标记颜色、大小、图像压缩等级等设计因素的影响；基于发现，构建包含16种变体的新型基准数据集VPBench。

Result: 视觉标记的颜色或大小变化可完全颠倒模型排名；低级推理设置（如JPEG压缩）也显著影响性能排序；调整标记尺寸后，InternVL3-8B表现接近甚至超越大型闭源模型如Gemini 2.5 Pro。

Conclusion: 当前视觉提示评估存在严重不稳定性，受非语义因素干扰极大。建议采用更严格、多样化的评估标准，如新提出的VPBench，以确保模型性能评估的公平性和可信度。

Abstract: A key challenge in evaluating VLMs is testing models' ability to analyze visual content independently from their textual priors. Recent benchmarks such as BLINK probe visual perception through visual prompting, where questions about visual content are paired with coordinates to which the question refers, with the coordinates explicitly marked in the image itself. While these benchmarks are an important part of VLM evaluation, we find that existing models are surprisingly fragile to seemingly irrelevant details of visual prompting: simply changing a visual marker from red to blue can completely change rankings among models on a leaderboard. By evaluating nine commonly-used open- and closed-source VLMs on two visually prompted tasks, we demonstrate how details in benchmark setup, including visual marker design and dataset size, have a significant influence on model performance and leaderboard rankings. These effects can even be exploited to lift weaker models above stronger ones; for instance, slightly increasing the size of the visual marker results in open-source InternVL3-8B ranking alongside or better than much larger proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro. We further show that low-level inference choices that are often ignored in benchmarking, such as JPEG compression levels in API calls, can also cause model lineup changes. These details have substantially larger impacts on visually prompted benchmarks than on conventional semantic VLM evaluations. To mitigate this instability, we curate existing datasets to create VPBench, a larger visually prompted benchmark with 16 visual marker variants. VPBench and additional analysis tools are released at https://lisadunlap.github.io/vpbench/.

Abstract: Multi-view 3D object detection is a fundamental task in autonomous driving perception, where achieving a balance between detection accuracy and computational efficiency remains crucial. Sparse query-based 3D detectors efficiently aggregate object-relevant features from multi-view images through a set of learnable queries, offering a concise and end-to-end detection paradigm. Building on this foundation, MV2D leverages 2D detection results to provide high-quality object priors for query initialization, enabling higher precision and recall. However, the inherent depth ambiguity in single-frame 2D detections still limits the accuracy of 3D query generation. To address this issue, we propose StereoMV2D, a unified framework that integrates temporal stereo modeling into the 2D detection-guided multi-view 3D detector. By exploiting cross-temporal disparities of the same object across adjacent frames, StereoMV2D enhances depth perception and refines the query priors, while performing all computations efficiently within 2D regions of interest (RoIs). Furthermore, a dynamic confidence gating mechanism adaptively evaluates the reliability of temporal stereo cues through learning statistical patterns derived from the inter-frame matching matrix together with appearance consistency, ensuring robust detection under object appearance and occlusion. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets demonstrate that StereoMV2D achieves superior detection performance without incurring significant computational overhead.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathFLIP提出一种新的框架，用于病理全切片图像（WSI）的细粒度视觉-语言预训练，通过将滑片级描述分解为区域级子描述并生成文本条件区域嵌入，实现精确的视觉-语言对齐。该方法利用大语言模型（LLM）支持多样临床指令，适用于多种诊断任务，如分类、检索、病灶定位和指令遵循。实验表明，PathFLIP在多个基准上优于现有大型病理视觉-语言模型，且所需训练数据更少，推动了临床实践中细粒度、指令感知的WSI分析。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved notable progress in computational pathology (CPath), the gigapixel scale and spatial heterogeneity of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) continue to pose challenges for multimodal understanding. Existing alignment methods struggle to capture fine-grained correspondences between textual descriptions and visual cues across thousands of patches from a slide, compromising their performance on downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose PathFLIP (Pathology Fine-grained Language-Image Pretraining), a novel framework for holistic WSI interpretation. PathFLIP decomposes slide-level captions into region-level subcaptions and generates text-conditioned region embeddings to facilitate precise visual-language grounding. By harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs), PathFLIP can seamlessly follow diverse clinical instructions and adapt to varied diagnostic contexts. Furthermore, it exhibits versatile capabilities across multiple paradigms, efficiently handling slide-level classification and retrieval, fine-grained lesion localization, and instruction following. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathFLIP outperforms existing large-scale pathological VLMs on four representative benchmarks while requiring significantly less training data, paving the way for fine-grained, instruction-aware WSI interpretation in clinical practice.

Conclusion: GRASP-HO成功将判别性感知与生成式推理融合，为开放世界人类-物体交互检测提供了高效、可扩展的新范式。

Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize human-object pairs and the interactions between them. Existing methods operate under a closed-world assumption, treating the task as a classification problem over a small, predefined verb set, which struggles to generalize to the long-tail of unseen or ambiguous interactions in the wild. While recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) possess the rich world knowledge required for open-vocabulary understanding, they remain decoupled from existing HOI detectors since fine-tuning them is computationally prohibitive. To address these constraints, we propose \GRASP-HO}, a novel Generative Reasoning And Steerable Perception framework that reformulates HOI detection from the closed-set classification task to the open-vocabulary generation problem. To bridge the vision and cognitive, we first extract hybrid interaction representations, then design a lightweight learnable cognitive steering conduit (CSC) module to inject the fine-grained visual evidence into a frozen MLLM for effective reasoning. To address the supervision mismatch between classification-based HOI datasets and open-vocabulary generative models, we introduce a hybrid guidance strategy that coupling the language modeling loss and auxiliary classification loss, enabling discriminative grounding without sacrificing generative flexibility. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art closed-set performance and strong zero-shot generalization, achieving a unified paradigm that seamlessly bridges discriminative perception and generative reasoning for open-world HOI detection.

Abstract: The In-context generation paradigm recently has demonstrated strong power in instructional image editing with both data efficiency and synthesis quality. Nevertheless, shaping such in-context learning for instruction-based video editing is not trivial. Without specifying editing regions, the results can suffer from the problem of inaccurate editing regions and the token interference between editing and non-editing areas during denoising. To address these, we present ReCo, a new instructional video editing paradigm that novelly delves into constraint modeling between editing and non-editing regions during in-context generation. Technically, ReCo width-wise concatenates source and target video for joint denoising. To calibrate video diffusion learning, ReCo capitalizes on two regularization terms, i.e., latent and attention regularization, conducting on one-step backward denoised latents and attention maps, respectively. The former increases the latent discrepancy of the editing region between source and target videos while reducing that of non-editing areas, emphasizing the modification on editing area and alleviating outside unexpected content generation. The latter suppresses the attention of tokens in the editing region to the tokens in counterpart of the source video, thereby mitigating their interference during novel object generation in target video. Furthermore, we propose a large-scale, high-quality video editing dataset, i.e., ReCo-Data, comprising 500K instruction-video pairs to benefit model training. Extensive experiments conducted on four major instruction-based video editing tasks demonstrate the superiority of our proposal.

Conclusion: Bitbox有望加速计算行为测量在行为科学、临床和心理健康研究中的融合与应用，其社区驱动的设计将推动持续演进与广泛合作。

Abstract: Computational measurement of human behavior from video has recently become feasible due to major advances in AI. These advances now enable granular and precise quantification of facial expression, head movement, body action, and other behavioral modalities and are increasingly used in psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, and mental health research. However, mainstream adoption remains slow. Most existing methods and software are developed for engineering audiences, require specialized software stacks, and fail to provide behavioral measurements at a level directly useful for hypothesis-driven research. As a result, there is a large barrier to entry for researchers who wish to use modern, AI-based tools in their work. We introduce Bitbox, an open-source toolkit designed to remove this barrier and make advanced computational analysis directly usable by behavioral scientists and clinical researchers. Bitbox is guided by principles of reproducibility, modularity, and interpretability. It provides a standardized interface for extracting high-level behavioral measurements from video, leveraging multiple face, head, and body processors. The core modules have been tested and validated on clinical samples and are designed so that new measures can be added with minimal effort. Bitbox is intended to serve both sides of the translational gap. It gives behavioral researchers access to robust, high-level behavioral metrics without requiring engineering expertise, and it provides computer scientists a practical mechanism for disseminating methods to domains where their impact is most needed. We expect that Bitbox will accelerate integration of computational behavioral measurement into behavioral, clinical, and mental health research. Bitbox has been designed from the beginning as a community-driven effort that will evolve through contributions from both method developers and domain scientists.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D头像重建方法通常依赖于精确的相机位姿和表情标签，限制了其在实际应用中的灵活性和可用性。此外，对罕见但重要的表情（如皱纹、露齿）建模不足，且难以在保持高质量变形的同时保留身份特异性细节。因此，亟需一种无需额外标注信息、能处理任意输入数量、具备高保真动态表现力并支持个性化细节增强的通用3D头像重建框架。

Method: 提出FlexAvatar模型，核心包括：(1) 基于Transformer的重建架构，使用结构化头查询令牌作为规范锚点，实现输入无关（input-number-agnostic）、无相机位姿、无表情标签的统一特征聚合；(2) 轻量级UNet解码器，以UV空间位置图为条件，生成高细节的表达相关形变；(3) 训练阶段引入数据分布调整策略，提升罕见表情样本的代表性；(4) 引入10秒轻量级微调模块，用于增强极端身份的个性细节，且不影响整体变形质量。

Abstract: We present FlexAvatar, a flexible large reconstruction model for high-fidelity 3D head avatars with detailed dynamic deformation from single or sparse images, without requiring camera poses or expression labels. It leverages a transformer-based reconstruction model with structured head query tokens as canonical anchor to aggregate flexible input-number-agnostic, camera-pose-free and expression-free inputs into a robust canonical 3D representation. For detailed dynamic deformation, we introduce a lightweight UNet decoder conditioned on UV-space position maps, which can produce detailed expression-dependent deformations in real time. To better capture rare but critical expressions like wrinkles and bared teeth, we also adopt a data distribution adjustment strategy during training to balance the distribution of these expressions in the training set. Moreover, a lightweight 10-second refinement can further enhances identity-specific details in extreme identities without affecting deformation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FlexAvatar achieves superior 3D consistency, detailed dynamic realism compared with previous methods, providing a practical solution for animatable 3D avatar creation.

Abstract: The advancement of safety-critical research in driving behavior in ADAS-equipped vehicles require real-world datasets that not only include diverse traffic scenarios but also capture high-risk edge cases such as near-miss events and system failures. However, existing datasets are largely limited to either simulated environments or human-driven vehicle data, lacking authentic ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) vehicle behavior under risk conditions. To address this gap, this paper introduces SAVeD, a large-scale video dataset curated from publicly available social media content, explicitly focused on ADAS vehicle-related crashes, near-miss incidents, and disengagements. SAVeD features 2,119 first-person videos, capturing ADAS vehicle operations in diverse locations, lighting conditions, and weather scenarios. The dataset includes video frame-level annotations for collisions, evasive maneuvers, and disengagements, enabling analysis of both perception and decision-making failures. We demonstrate SAVeD's utility through multiple analyses and contributions: (1) We propose a novel framework integrating semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation to compute real-time Time-to-Collision (TTC) for dynamic objects. (2) We utilize the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution to model and quantify the extreme risk in crash and near-miss events across different roadway types. (3) We establish benchmarks for state-of-the-art VLLMs (VideoLLaMA2 and InternVL2.5 HiCo R16), showing that SAVeD's detailed annotations significantly enhance model performance through domain adaptation in complex near-miss scenarios.

TL;DR: MambaMIL+ 是一种新型的多实例学习框架，用于解决全切片图像（WSI）在计算病理学中因高分辨率和缺乏细粒度标注带来的挑战。该方法通过重叠扫描、选择性条纹位置编码（S2PE）和上下文标记选择（CTS）机制，有效建模长序列中的空间上下文关系，克服了传统Mamba模型在空间建模和记忆衰减方面的局限。在20个基准数据集上的实验表明，MambaMIL+ 在三种不同特征提取器下均达到领先性能，展现出卓越的有效性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全切片图像（WSI）具有极高的分辨率，且缺乏细粒度标注，对传统深度学习模型构成挑战。虽然多实例学习（MIL）通过将每张WSI视为一组补丁实例来缓解此问题，但如何有效建模超长序列中的丰富空间上下文仍是一个难题。尽管Mamba在处理长序列方面表现出线性扩展能力，但在空间上下文建模和记忆保持方面仍有不足，限制了其在WSI分析中的应用。

Method: MambaMIL+ 提出三个核心改进：1）重叠扫描，重构补丁序列以嵌入空间连续性和实例相关性；2）选择性条纹位置编码（S2PE），编码位置信息并减少固定扫描顺序带来的偏差；3）上下文标记选择（CTS）机制，利用监督知识动态扩展上下文记忆，实现稳定的长程建模。

Result: 在20个涵盖诊断分类、分子预测和生存分析的基准数据集上，MambaMIL+ 在三种特征提取器（ResNet-50、PLIP、CONCH）下均实现了最先进的性能，验证了其在大规模计算病理学任务中的有效性与鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MambaMIL+ 通过引入空间上下文建模与长程依赖保持机制，在不牺牲效率的前提下显著提升了WSI分析性能，为计算病理学中的长序列建模提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) are an important data modality in computational pathology, yet their gigapixel resolution and lack of fine-grained annotations challenge conventional deep learning models. Multiple instance learning (MIL) offers a solution by treating each WSI as a bag of patch-level instances, but effectively modeling ultra-long sequences with rich spatial context remains difficult. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising alternative for long sequence learning, scaling linearly to thousands of tokens. However, despite its efficiency, it still suffers from limited spatial context modeling and memory decay, constraining its effectiveness to WSI analysis. To address these limitations, we propose MambaMIL+, a new MIL framework that explicitly integrates spatial context while maintaining long-range dependency modeling without memory forgetting. Specifically, MambaMIL+ introduces 1) overlapping scanning, which restructures the patch sequence to embed spatial continuity and instance correlations; 2) a selective stripe position encoder (S2PE) that encodes positional information while mitigating the biases of fixed scanning orders; and 3) a contextual token selection (CTS) mechanism, which leverages supervisory knowledge to dynamically enlarge the contextual memory for stable long-range modeling. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across diagnostic classification, molecular prediction, and survival analysis demonstrate that MambaMIL+ consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance under three feature extractors (ResNet-50, PLIP, and CONCH), highlighting its effectiveness and robustness for large-scale computational pathology

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation have led to the widespread availability of highly realistic synthetic media, increasing the difficulty of reliable deepfake detection. A key challenge is generalization, as detectors trained on a narrow class of generators often fail when confronted with unseen models. In this work, we address the pressing need for generalizable detection by leveraging large vision-language models, specifically CLIP, to identify synthetic content across diverse generative techniques. First, we introduce Diff-Gen, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 100k diffusion-generated fakes that capture broad spectral artifacts unlike traditional GAN datasets. Models trained on Diff-Gen demonstrate stronger cross-domain generalization, particularly on previously unseen image generators. Second, we propose AdaptPrompt, a parameter-efficient transfer learning framework that jointly learns task-specific textual prompts and visual adapters while keeping the CLIP backbone frozen. We further show via layer ablation that pruning the final transformer block of the vision encoder enhances the retention of high-frequency generative artifacts, significantly boosting detection accuracy. Our evaluation spans 25 challenging test sets, covering synthetic content generated by GANs, diffusion models, and commercial tools, establishing a new state-of-the-art in both standard and cross-domain scenarios. We further demonstrate the framework's versatility through few-shot generalization (using as few as 320 images) and source attribution, enabling the precise identification of generator architectures in closed-set settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteGE is a lightweight method for computing geodesic distances on 3D surfaces using compact, category-aware shape descriptors derived from PCA of unsigned distance field samples at informative voxels. It significantly reduces memory and inference time (up to 300×) compared to neural methods, works well even with sparse point clouds (as few as 300 points), and enables fast shape matching with up to 1000× speedup over mesh-based approaches while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based methods for geodesic distance computation rely on large 3D neural backbones, resulting in high memory usage and latency, which limits their applicability in interactive or resource-constrained environments. There is a need for a more efficient, lightweight alternative that maintains accuracy and robustness.

Method: LiteGE constructs compact shape descriptors by applying PCA to unsigned distance field (UDF) samples at informative voxels. This approach avoids the need for high-capacity networks and enables efficient computation of geodesic distances. The method leverages the intrinsic relationship between geodesic distance and shape correspondence for fast and accurate shape matching.

Result: LiteGE reduces memory usage and inference time by up to 300× compared to neural methods. It performs robustly on sparse point clouds (down to 300 points), and achieves up to 1000× speedup over state-of-the-art mesh-based approaches while maintaining comparable accuracy on non-isometric shape pairs, including point-cloud inputs.

Conclusion: LiteGE provides an efficient, lightweight solution for geodesic distance computation that is suitable for resource-constrained and interactive applications. Its ability to handle sparse inputs and enable fast shape matching makes it a strong alternative to existing neural and mesh-based methods.

Abstract: Computing geodesic distances on 3D surfaces is fundamental to many tasks in 3D vision and geometry processing, with deep connections to tasks such as shape correspondence. Recent learning-based methods achieve strong performance but rely on large 3D backbones, leading to high memory usage and latency, which limit their use in interactive or resource-constrained settings. We introduce LiteGE, a lightweight approach that constructs compact, category-aware shape descriptors by applying PCA to unsigned distance field (UDFs) samples at informative voxels. This descriptor is efficient to compute and removes the need for high-capacity networks. LiteGE remains robust on sparse point clouds, supporting inputs with as few as 300 points, where prior methods fail. Extensive experiments show that LiteGE reduces memory usage and inference time by up to 300$\times$ compared to existing neural approaches. In addition, by exploiting the intrinsic relationship between geodesic distance and shape correspondence, LiteGE enables fast and accurate shape matching. Our method achieves up to 1000$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art mesh-based approaches while maintaining comparable accuracy on non-isometric shape pairs, including evaluations on point-cloud inputs.

Result: 在20%-85%云覆盖下，UrbanDIFF显著优于插值方法，尤其在85%云覆盖时保持高精度（SSIM 0.89，RMSE 1.2 K，R² 0.84），且性能退化较慢，展现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UrbanDIFF为城市地表温度重建提供了一种高效、鲁棒的纯空间解决方案，特别适用于云覆盖严重但缺乏辅助观测数据的场景，具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: Satellite-derived Land Surface Temperature (LST) products are central to surface urban heat island (SUHI) monitoring due to their consistent grid-based coverage over large metropolitan regions. However, cloud contamination frequently obscures LST observations, limiting their usability for continuous SUHI analysis. Most existing LST reconstruction methods rely on multitemporal information or multisensor data fusion, requiring auxiliary observations that may be unavailable or unreliable under persistent cloud cover. Purely spatial gap-filling approaches offer an alternative, but traditional statistical methods degrade under large or spatially contiguous gaps, while many deep learning based spatial models deteriorate rapidly with increasing missingness.
  Recent advances in denoising diffusion based image inpainting models have demonstrated improved robustness under high missingness, motivating their adoption for spatial LST reconstruction. In this work, we introduce UrbanDIFF, a purely spatial denoising diffusion model for reconstructing cloud contaminated urban LST imagery. The model is conditioned on static urban structure information, including built-up surface data and a digital elevation model, and enforces strict consistency with revealed cloud free pixels through a supervised pixel guided refinement step during inference.
  UrbanDIFF is trained and evaluated using NASA MODIS Terra LST data from seven major United States metropolitan areas spanning 2002 to 2025. Experiments using synthetic cloud masks with 20 to 85 percent coverage show that UrbanDIFF consistently outperforms an interpolation baseline, particularly under dense cloud occlusion, achieving SSIM of 0.89, RMSE of 1.2 K, and R2 of 0.84 at 85 percent cloud coverage, while exhibiting slower performance degradation as cloud density increases.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Chorus是一个多教师预训练框架，通过从2D基础模型中蒸馏互补信号，学习一个全面的前馈3D高斯溅射（3DGS）场景编码器。它利用共享的3D编码器和教师特定的投影器，从语言对齐、通用性和对象感知教师中学习，以在共享嵌入空间中捕捉从高层语义到细粒度结构的信号。该方法在多种任务上表现优异，包括开放词汇语义和实例分割、线性与解码器探测以及数据高效监督。此外，其变体仅使用高斯中心、颜色和估计法向量作为输入，在点云基准上也表现出强迁移能力，且仅需39.9倍少的训练场景。研究还提出了一种渲染-蒸馏适应策略，支持域外微调。代码和模型将在发表后公开。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS虽已成为高保真场景表示，但直接从其基元中编码丰富通用特征仍缺乏探索。现有方法难以有效捕捉从高层语义到细粒度结构的多层次信息，因此需要一种能够整合多源知识并提升泛化能力的预训练框架。

Method: 提出Chorus框架，采用共享3D编码器与教师特定投影器，融合语言对齐、通用性及对象感知教师的信号，通过知识蒸馏构建统一的嵌入空间。同时设计渲染-蒸馏适应机制以支持域外微调，并在点云基准上测试基于高斯中心、颜色和法向量的简化版本。

Result: Chorus在开放词汇语义/实例分割、线性与解码器探测、数据高效监督等任务上均取得优异性能；其点云适配版本仅用39.9倍少的训练场景即超越基线，展现出强大迁移能力；渲染-蒸馏策略有效支持出域微调。

Conclusion: Chorus成功实现了对3DGS场景的高效通用特征编码，显著提升了跨任务泛化能力，并为3D场景理解提供了轻量化、可迁移的预训练解决方案。

Abstract: While 3DGS has emerged as a high-fidelity scene representation, encoding rich, general-purpose features directly from its primitives remains under-explored. We address this gap by introducing Chorus, a multi-teacher pretraining framework that learns a holistic feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene encoder by distilling complementary signals from 2D foundation models. Chorus employs a shared 3D encoder and teacher-specific projectors to learn from language-aligned, generalist, and object-aware teachers, encouraging a shared embedding space that captures signals from high-level semantics to fine-grained structure.
  We evaluate Chorus on a wide range of tasks: open-vocabulary semantic and instance segmentation, linear and decoder probing, as well as data-efficient supervision. Besides 3DGS, we also test Chorus on several benchmarks that only support point clouds by pretraining a variant using only Gaussians' centers, colors, estimated normals as inputs. Interestingly, this encoder shows strong transfer and outperforms the point clouds baseline while using 39.9 times fewer training scenes. Finally, we propose a render-and-distill adaptation that facilitates out-of-domain finetuning. Our code and model will be released upon publication.

*Roshan Kenia,Xiaoman Zhang,Pranav Rajpurkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReX-MLE is a new benchmark for evaluating autonomous coding agents in medical imaging, focusing on end-to-end workflows with realistic constraints. It reveals significant performance gaps between current agents and human experts due to domain-specific knowledge and engineering shortcomings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to assess autonomous agents on complex, domain-specific scientific tasks like medical imaging, which require specialized preprocessing, high-dimensional data handling, and long training cycles. There is a need for a more rigorous evaluation framework tailored to such domains.

Method: ReX-MLE introduces 20 challenges derived from real-world medical imaging competitions across diverse modalities and task types. It evaluates agents on full end-to-end workflows—including data preprocessing, model training, and submission—under realistic compute and time limits.

Result: State-of-the-art agents (AIDE, ML-Master, R&D-Agent) using various LLM backends (GPT-5, Gemini, Claude) consistently perform poorly, ranking in the 0th percentile compared to human experts. Failures are attributed to lack of domain knowledge and engineering capability.

Conclusion: ReX-MLE exposes critical limitations in current autonomous coding agents for scientific domains and provides a foundation for developing more domain-aware, capable AI systems.

Abstract: Autonomous coding agents built on large language models (LLMs) can now solve many general software and machine learning tasks, but they remain ineffective on complex, domain-specific scientific problems. Medical imaging is a particularly demanding domain, requiring long training cycles, high-dimensional data handling, and specialized preprocessing and validation pipelines, capabilities not fully measured in existing agent benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce ReX-MLE, a benchmark of 20 challenges derived from high-impact medical imaging competitions spanning diverse modalities and task types. Unlike prior ML-agent benchmarks, ReX-MLE evaluates full end-to-end workflows, requiring agents to independently manage data preprocessing, model training, and submission under realistic compute and time constraints. Evaluating state-of-the-art agents (AIDE, ML-Master, R&D-Agent) with different LLM backends (GPT-5, Gemini, Claude), we observe a severe performance gap: most submissions rank in the 0th percentile compared to human experts. Failures stem from domain-knowledge and engineering limitations. ReX-MLE exposes these bottlenecks and provides a foundation for developing domain-aware autonomous AI systems.

*Baohua Yan,Qingyuan Liu,Jennifer Kava,Xuan Di*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InSPECT是一种新型扩散模型，通过在前向和反向过程中保持不变的谱特征，解决了传统扩散模型将数据完全扩散至白噪声所带来的计算难题。该方法使傅里叶系数平滑收敛到指定随机噪声，同时保留特征、维持多样性与随机性。实验表明，在CIFAR-10、Celeb-A和LSUN数据集上，InSPECT相比DDPM在10,000次迭代下平均降低39.23%的FID、提升45.80%的IS，显著提升了生成质量、多样性与计算效率，并实现更快收敛。这是首个系统分析并保留扩散模型中不变谱特征的工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型需将数据完全扩散至白噪声再重建，导致预测任务极难且计算成本高。为缓解此问题，提出保留不变谱特征以改善生成过程的稳定性与效率。

Method: 设计InSPECT模型，通过在前向与反向扩散过程中保持不变的谱特征（如傅里叶系数），使数据在扩散末期平稳过渡至随机噪声，从而兼顾特征保留、多样性与计算效率。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，InSPECT相较DDPM实现平均39.23%的FID降低和45.80%的IS提升，在10,000次迭代内完成训练，证明其在生成质量、多样性及收敛速度上的显著优势。

Conclusion: InSPECT是首个系统研究并利用不变谱特征的扩散模型，通过保留关键频域特征，显著提升生成性能与计算效率，为未来扩散模型设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: Modern diffusion models (DMs) have achieved state-of-the-art image generation. However, the fundamental design choice of diffusing data all the way to white noise and then reconstructing it leads to an extremely difficult and computationally intractable prediction task. To overcome this limitation, we propose InSPECT (Invariant Spectral Feature-Preserving Diffusion Model), a novel diffusion model that keeps invariant spectral features during both the forward and backward processes. At the end of the forward process, the Fourier coefficients smoothly converge to a specified random noise, enabling features preservation while maintaining diversity and randomness. By preserving invariant features, InSPECT demonstrates enhanced visual diversity, faster convergence rate, and a smoother diffusion process. Experiments on CIFAR-10, Celeb-A, and LSUN demonstrate that InSPECT achieves on average a 39.23% reduction in FID and 45.80% improvement in IS against DDPM for 10K iterations under specified parameter settings, which demonstrates the significant advantages of preserving invariant features: achieving superior generation quality and diversity, while enhancing computational efficiency and enabling faster convergence rate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to analyze and preserve invariant spectral features in diffusion models.

*Kristoffer Wickstrøm,Teresa Dorszewski,Siyan Chen,Michael Kampffmeyer,Elisabeth Wetzer,Robert Jenssen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需重新训练即可将任何已训练的基于视觉变压器（ViT）的模型转变为自解释模型（SEMs）的新方法，称为关键点计数分类器（KCCs）。该方法利用ViT在图像间自动识别匹配关键点的能力，构建了一个直观且可视觉化的决策过程，显著提升了人机沟通效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自解释模型的设计需要复杂的训练过程和特定架构，这在基于视觉变压器的通用基础模型发展背景下愈发不切实际，亟需新的方法来提升ViT基础模型的透明度与可靠性。

Method: 基于ViT能够高精度自动识别图像间匹配关键点的特性，提出一种无需重训练的转换方法，将现有ViT模型转化为可解释的分类器，通过关键点计数实现决策过程的可视化。

Result: 实验表明，KCCs在提升人类与机器之间的沟通效率方面优于现有基线方法，为使ViT基础模型更具透明性和可靠性提供了重要进展。

Conclusion: KCCs是一种有效、实用且无需重训练的自解释方法，有助于推动基于视觉变压器的基础模型向更透明、更可信的方向发展。

Abstract: Current approaches for designing self-explainable models (SEMs) require complicated training procedures and specific architectures which makes them impractical. With the advance of general purpose foundation models based on Vision Transformers (ViTs), this impracticability becomes even more problematic. Therefore, new methods are necessary to provide transparency and reliability to ViT-based foundation models. In this work, we present a new method for turning any well-trained ViT-based model into a SEM without retraining, which we call Keypoint Counting Classifiers (KCCs). Recent works have shown that ViTs can automatically identify matching keypoints between images with high precision, and we build on these results to create an easily interpretable decision process that is inherently visualizable in the input. We perform an extensive evaluation which show that KCCs improve the human-machine communication compared to recent baselines. We believe that KCCs constitute an important step towards making ViT-based foundation models more transparent and reliable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动生成方法大多任务特定，难以泛化到灵活的多智能体生成；人类在群体中自然协作，但建模此类交互仍面临长时序、强智能体依赖性和可变群体规模等挑战。因此需要一种通用、可扩展的多智能体运动生成框架。

Method: 提出 MAGNet（多智能体扩散强制变换器），基于扩散强制机制进行关键改进，显式建模自回归去噪过程中的智能体间耦合关系，采用统一的自回归扩散架构，支持多种交互任务的灵活条件输入与采样，具备可扩展性以适应不同数量的智能体。

Conclusion: MAGNet 提供了一个统一、可扩展的多智能体运动生成框架，有效解决了多智能体交互建模中的长期依赖、强耦合和群体规模可变等问题，为机器人和社交计算中的群体行为建模提供了新范式。

Abstract: Understanding and generating multi-person interactions is a fundamental challenge with broad implications for robotics and social computing. While humans naturally coordinate in groups, modeling such interactions remains difficult due to long temporal horizons, strong inter-agent dependencies, and variable group sizes. Existing motion generation methods are largely task-specific and do not generalize to flexible multi-agent generation. We introduce MAGNet (Multi-Agent Diffusion Forcing Transformer), a unified autoregressive diffusion framework for multi-agent motion generation that supports a wide range of interaction tasks through flexible conditioning and sampling. MAGNet performs dyadic prediction, partner inpainting, and full multi-agent motion generation within a single model, and can autoregressively generate ultra-long sequences spanning hundreds of v. Building on Diffusion Forcing, we introduce key modifications that explicitly model inter-agent coupling during autoregressive denoising, enabling coherent coordination across agents. As a result, MAGNet captures both tightly synchronized activities (e.g, dancing, boxing) and loosely structured social interactions. Our approach performs on par with specialized methods on dyadic benchmarks while naturally extending to polyadic scenarios involving three or more interacting people, enabled by a scalable architecture that is agnostic to the number of agents. We refer readers to the supplemental video, where the temporal dynamics and spatial coordination of generated interactions are best appreciated. Project page: https://von31.github.io/MAGNet/

Motivation: 当前数字孪生系统多为静态，缺乏具身交互能力，难以支持真实的人机互动。需要一种方法来建模人类动作如何动态改变环境，从而实现更真实的交互式数字孪生。

Method: DWM采用视频扩散模型，以静态3D场景渲染和第一人称手部网格动作为输入，生成时空一致的交互视频。利用合成数据提供精确对齐的监督信号，同时融合真实世界视频增强物体动态的真实感。

Result: 实验表明，DWM可生成具有物理合理性且保持相机与场景一致性的交互视频，成功实现抓取、打开、移动等复杂动作，是基于视频扩散的交互式数字孪生的重要一步。

Conclusion: DWM首次实现了基于视频扩散的交互式数字孪生，能够从第一人称动作生成逼真的动态场景视频，为具身仿真提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recent progress in 3D reconstruction has made it easy to create realistic digital twins from everyday environments. However, current digital twins remain largely static and are limited to navigation and view synthesis without embodied interactivity. To bridge this gap, we introduce Dexterous World Model (DWM), a scene-action-conditioned video diffusion framework that models how dexterous human actions induce dynamic changes in static 3D scenes.
  Given a static 3D scene rendering and an egocentric hand motion sequence, DWM generates temporally coherent videos depicting plausible human-scene interactions. Our approach conditions video generation on (1) static scene renderings following a specified camera trajectory to ensure spatial consistency, and (2) egocentric hand mesh renderings that encode both geometry and motion cues to model action-conditioned dynamics directly. To train DWM, we construct a hybrid interaction video dataset. Synthetic egocentric interactions provide fully aligned supervision for joint locomotion and manipulation learning, while fixed-camera real-world videos contribute diverse and realistic object dynamics.
  Experiments demonstrate that DWM enables realistic and physically plausible interactions, such as grasping, opening, and moving objects, while maintaining camera and scene consistency. This framework represents a first step toward video diffusion-based interactive digital twins and enables embodied simulation from egocentric actions.

Abstract: Modern Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) typically operate in low-level Variational Autoencoder (VAE) latent spaces that are primarily optimized for pixel-level reconstruction. To unify vision generation and understanding, a burgeoning trend is to adopt high-dimensional features from representation encoders as generative latents. However, we empirically identify two fundamental obstacles in this paradigm: (1) the discriminative feature space lacks compact regularization, making diffusion models prone to off-manifold latents that lead to inaccurate object structures; and (2) the encoder's inherently weak pixel-level reconstruction hinders the generator from learning accurate fine-grained geometry and texture. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework to adapt understanding-oriented encoder features for generative tasks. We introduce a semantic-pixel reconstruction objective to regularize the latent space, enabling the compression of both semantic information and fine-grained details into a highly compact representation (96 channels with 16x16 spatial downsampling). This design ensures that the latent space remains semantically rich and achieves state-of-the-art image reconstruction, while remaining compact enough for accurate generation. Leveraging this representation, we design a unified Text-to-Image (T2I) and image editing model. Benchmarking against various feature spaces, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction, faster convergence, and substantial performance gains in both T2I and editing tasks, validating that representation encoders can be effectively adapted into robust generative components.

TL;DR: 本文引入了首个专注于女性健康领域的大型语言模型（LLM）评估基准——女性健康基准（WHB），涵盖96个经过严格验证的模型测试条目，涉及五个医学领域、三种查询类型和八类错误。评估13个前沿LLM发现，当前模型在女性健康任务中平均失败率高达60%，尤其在识别紧急情况方面表现极差；尽管GPT-5等新模型在避免不当建议方面有所改进，但整体可靠性仍不足，表明AI聊天机器人尚无法提供可靠的女性健康建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在女性健康信息提供方面的准确性未被充分评估，而该领域对患者和临床决策至关重要，亟需一个专门的评估框架来揭示模型缺陷并推动改进。

Method: 构建包含96个经验证模型条目的女性健康基准（WHB），覆盖妇产科、急诊医学、全科医学、肿瘤学和神经病学五个专科，以及患者咨询、医生咨询和证据/政策查询三类查询形式，并系统标注八种常见错误类型（如用药错误、关键信息缺失、过时指南、治疗建议错误等）。对13个先进LLM进行测试与分析。

Result: 13个主流LLM在该基准上平均失败率约为60%，不同专科和错误类型间表现差异显著；所有模型普遍难以识别‘遗漏紧急信号’，而新模型如GPT-5在减少不当建议方面有明显进步。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在女性健康领域尚未达到可信赖的临床应用水平，需进一步改进以保障患者安全，特别是提升对紧急情况的敏感性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become primary sources of health information for millions, their accuracy in women's health remains critically unexamined. We introduce the Women's Health Benchmark (WHB), the first benchmark evaluating LLM performance specifically in women's health. Our benchmark comprises 96 rigorously validated model stumps covering five medical specialties (obstetrics and gynecology, emergency medicine, primary care, oncology, and neurology), three query types (patient query, clinician query, and evidence/policy query), and eight error types (dosage/medication errors, missing critical information, outdated guidelines/treatment recommendations, incorrect treatment advice, incorrect factual information, missing/incorrect differential diagnosis, missed urgency, and inappropriate recommendations). We evaluated 13 state-of-the-art LLMs and revealed alarming gaps: current models show approximately 60\% failure rates on the women's health benchmark, with performance varying dramatically across specialties and error types. Notably, models universally struggle with "missed urgency" indicators, while newer models like GPT-5 show significant improvements in avoiding inappropriate recommendations. Our findings underscore that AI chatbots are not yet fully able of providing reliable advice in women's health.

TL;DR: 本文提出 Struct-SQL，一种基于结构化思维链的知识蒸馏框架，通过查询执行计划作为正式逻辑蓝图，指导小语言模型（SLM）学习大语言模型（LLM）的精确推理过程。相比非结构化思维链蒸馏，该方法在文本转SQL任务上实现8.1%的绝对性能提升，尤其显著减少语法错误，验证了结构化推理对SLM可靠生成SQL的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前企业级文本转SQL系统面临成本、安全与性能之间的三难困境；现有方案依赖昂贵的专有大模型或性能较差的小模型，而现有小模型改进方法多基于模糊的非结构化思维链蒸馏，缺乏清晰可靠的训练信号。

Method: 提出 Struct-SQL 框架，利用查询执行计划作为形式化的逻辑蓝图，生成结构化的思维链用于知识蒸馏，使小语言模型能够更准确地模仿大语言模型的推理过程。

Result: 所提出的结构化蒸馏方法在文本转SQL任务上比非结构化蒸馏基线提升8.1%；误差分析显示，主要优势来自语法错误的显著减少。

Conclusion: 采用结构化逻辑蓝图进行推理教学能有效提升小语言模型在文本转SQL任务中的表现，为低成本、高安全、高性能的企业级系统提供可行路径。

Abstract: Deploying accurate Text-to-SQL systems at the enterprise level faces a difficult trilemma involving cost, security and performance. Current solutions force enterprises to choose between expensive, proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) and low-performing Small Language Models (SLMs). Efforts to improve SLMs often rely on distilling reasoning from large LLMs using unstructured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, a process that remains inherently ambiguous. Instead, we hypothesize that a formal, structured reasoning representation provides a clearer, more reliable teaching signal, as the Text-to-SQL task requires explicit and precise logical steps. To evaluate this hypothesis, we propose Struct-SQL, a novel Knowledge Distillation (KD) framework that trains an SLM to emulate a powerful large LLM. Consequently, we adopt a query execution plan as a formal blueprint to derive this structured reasoning. Our SLM, distilled with structured CoT, achieves an absolute improvement of 8.1% over an unstructured CoT distillation baseline. A detailed error analysis reveals that a key factor in this gain is a marked reduction in syntactic errors. This demonstrates that teaching a model to reason using a structured logical blueprint is beneficial for reliable SQL generation in SLMs.

Motivation: 当前非自回归语言模型的实现多为定制化，缺乏统一的训练与推理框架，导致难以进行系统性比较，且各模型间组件难以复用。

Method: 开发了一个名为XLM的Python包，支持快速构建小型非自回归语言模型，并配套提供xlm-models包以发布预训练模型，统一数据处理、损失计算和预测逻辑。

Conclusion: XLM框架显著降低了非自回归语言模型的开发门槛，促进了该领域的方法标准化与共享，为后续研究提供了有力支持。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in non-autoregressive text generation in the context of general language modeling. Unlike the well-established autoregressive language modeling paradigm, which has a plethora of standard training and inference libraries, implementations of non-autoregressive language modeling have largely been bespoke making it difficult to perform systematic comparisons of different methods. Moreover, each non-autoregressive language model typically requires it own data collation, loss, and prediction logic, making it challenging to reuse common components. In this work, we present the XLM python package, which is designed to make implementing small non-autoregressive language models faster with a secondary goal of providing a suite of small pre-trained models (through a companion xlm-models package) that can be used by the research community. The code is available at https://github.com/dhruvdcoder/xlm-core.

### [88] [When F1 Fails: Granularity-Aware Evaluation for Dialogue Topic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17083)
*Michael H. Coen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种新的对话主题分割评估范式，强调边界密度和段落连贯性，并引入窗口容错的F1（W-F1）指标。通过跨数据集实证分析，发现现有性能差异主要源于标注粒度不匹配和稀疏边界标签，而非模型真实能力提升。研究揭示主题分割应关注合适粒度选择，而非单一正确边界预测，并通过分离边界评分与边界选择来实现这一理念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话主题分割评估仍依赖严格的边界匹配和F1指标，但现代大模型系统在处理长对话时面临上下文积累导致效率与连贯性下降的问题。当前评估方法无法反映实际应用需求，且易受标注粒度和稀疏标签影响，产生误导性结果。

Method: 提出以边界密度和段落连贯性为核心评估标准，引入窗口容错的F1（W-F1）指标；设计并实施多策略、跨八种不同对话类型的数据集评估实验；明确区分边界评分与边界选择两个阶段，以更合理地衡量分割质量。

Result: 实验表明，多数报告的性能提升源于评估偏差而非模型改进；高连贯性与极端过度分割共存，导致精确匹配F1值偏低；主题分割的本质是选择合适的粒度，而非寻找唯一正确边界集。

Conclusion: 对话主题分割不应追求单一精确边界，而应基于任务需求选择合适粒度。评估应采用更贴近实际应用的指标，如W-F1和段落连贯性，并通过分离边界评分与选择过程提升评估合理性。

Abstract: Dialogue topic segmentation supports summarization, retrieval, memory management, and conversational continuity. Despite decades of prior work, evaluation practice in dialogue topic segmentation remains dominated by strict boundary matching and F1-based metrics, even as modern LLM-based conversational systems increasingly rely on segmentation to manage conversation history beyond the model's fixed context window, where unstructured context accumulation degrades efficiency and coherence.
  This paper introduces an evaluation objective for dialogue topic segmentation that treats boundary density and segment coherence as primary criteria, alongside window-tolerant F1 (W-F1). Through extensive cross-dataset empirical evaluation, we show that reported performance differences across dialogue segmentation benchmarks are driven not by model quality, but by annotation granularity mismatches and sparse boundary labels. This indicates that many reported improvements arise from evaluation artifacts rather than improved boundary detection.
  We evaluated multiple, structurally distinct dialogue segmentation strategies across eight dialogue datasets spanning task-oriented, open-domain, meeting-style, and synthetic interactions. Across these settings, we observe high segment coherence combined with extreme oversegmentation relative to sparse labels, producing misleadingly low exact-match F1 scores. We show that topic segmentation is best understood as selecting an appropriate granularity rather than predicting a single correct boundary set. We operationalize this view by explicitly separating boundary scoring from boundary selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长文本摘要方法在处理信息密集型文档时，常出现事实不一致、细节丢失等问题，缺乏对重要信息的系统性规划，导致摘要忠实度和可追溯性不足。因此，亟需一种能有效规划内容并指导生成过程的方法，以提升摘要质量。

Method: 提出强调引导生成框架，采用自规划方法识别关键内容，生成摘要时基于该内容计划进行条件生成。探索了端到端与两阶段两种变体，其中两阶段方法在长文档上表现更佳。

Result: 在多个长文本摘要数据集上，该方法显著提升事实一致性，同时保持摘要的相关性和整体质量。在GovReport上，最佳模型ROUGE-L提升4.1点，SummaC得分提升约35%。定性分析显示摘要更准确、更具洞察力，有效保留关键细节。

Conclusion: 强调引导生成方法通过引入句子级内容规划，有效提升了长文本摘要的忠实度、可追溯性和准确性，尤其适用于信息密集型长文档，是当前长文本摘要任务中一种高效且可靠的新范式。

Abstract: We introduce a novel approach for long context summarisation, highlight-guided generation, that leverages sentence-level information as a content plan to improve the traceability and faithfulness of generated summaries. Our framework applies self-planning methods to identify important content and then generates a summary conditioned on the plan. We explore both an end-to-end and two-stage variants of the approach, finding that the two-stage pipeline performs better on long and information-dense documents. Experiments on long-form summarisation datasets demonstrate that our method consistently improves factual consistency while preserving relevance and overall quality. On GovReport, our best approach has improved ROUGE-L by 4.1 points and achieves about 35% gains in SummaC scores. Qualitative analysis shows that highlight-guided summarisation helps preserve important details, leading to more accurate and insightful summaries across domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MiA-RAG 是首个为基于大语言模型的检索增强生成系统引入显式全局上下文感知能力的方法。通过分层摘要构建‘心智景观’（mindscape），并以此指导检索和生成过程，使系统在长文本理解和跨文档推理任务中表现更优，更接近人类的认知方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的 RAG 系统缺乏对长文本整体语义的全局理解能力，难以有效处理复杂、长篇幅的内容，而人类在理解长文本时依赖于整体语义表征（即心智景观）。因此，需要一种机制让 RAG 系统具备类似的人类全局认知能力。

Method: 提出 MiA-RAG 框架，采用分层摘要技术构建全局语义表示（心智景观），并将该表示用于条件化检索（生成更丰富的查询嵌入）和生成（在一致的全局背景下整合证据）。

Result: 在多个长上下文与双语证据理解及全局意义构建基准测试中，MiA-RAG 均显著优于现有基线模型；分析表明其能更好将局部细节与全局语义对齐，实现更类人的推理与检索。

Conclusion: MiA-RAG 成功实现了对长文本的全局语义感知，提升了 RAG 系统在复杂任务中的表现，为构建更具人类认知特性的智能系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Humans understand long and complex texts by relying on a holistic semantic representation of the content. This global view helps organize prior knowledge, interpret new information, and integrate evidence dispersed across a document, as revealed by the Mindscape-Aware Capability of humans in psychology. Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems lack such guidance and therefore struggle with long-context tasks. In this paper, we propose Mindscape-Aware RAG (MiA-RAG), the first approach that equips LLM-based RAG systems with explicit global context awareness. MiA-RAG builds a mindscape through hierarchical summarization and conditions both retrieval and generation on this global semantic representation. This enables the retriever to form enriched query embeddings and the generator to reason over retrieved evidence within a coherent global context. We evaluate MiA-RAG across diverse long-context and bilingual benchmarks for evidence-based understanding and global sense-making. It consistently surpasses baselines, and further analysis shows that it aligns local details with a coherent global representation, enabling more human-like long-context retrieval and reasoning.

*Zahra Rahmani,Hossein Sameti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种噪声敏感的自动语音识别（ASR）错误纠正框架，通过结合多假设与噪声感知建模来提升低资源语言（如波斯语）在嘈杂环境下的识别性能。采用修改后的Whisper-large解码器生成5个最佳候选转录结果，并引入误差级噪声（ELN）作为表征，量化噪声引起的语义和词级别不一致，从而为大语言模型（LLM）提供噪声不确定性信息以辅助纠错。评估了三种模型：未微调的LLaMA-2-7B、仅用文本微调的版本以及融合ELN嵌入的噪声条件模型。实验表明，结合ELN的微调模型在混合噪声测试集上将词错误率（WER）从原始Whisper的31.10%降至24.84%，显著优于仅文本微调的30.79%基准，而原始LLaMA-2-7B反而使WER上升至64.58%，说明其无法独立修正波斯语错误。结果验证了多假设与噪声感知嵌入结合的有效性，提升了真实噪声场景下波斯语ASR的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言如波斯语在噪声环境下自动语音识别（ASR）性能严重下降，现有先进模型如Whisper也难以维持准确性，尤其在不同信噪比（SNR）条件下。因此亟需一种能够有效应对噪声干扰并提升识别鲁棒性的错误纠正机制。

Method: 提出一种噪声敏感的ASR错误纠正框架，利用修改后的Whisper-large解码器生成5个最佳转录候选；引入误差级噪声（ELN）作为表征，捕捉多个假设间的语义与词级不一致性，量化噪声引起的语言扭曲；结合大语言模型（LLaMA-2-7B），通过微调及融合ELN嵌入（句子级与词级）实现噪声条件下的智能纠错。

Result: 所提出的细调+ELN模型在混合噪声测试集上将词错误率（WER）从原始Whisper的31.10%降低至24.84%，显著优于仅文本微调的30.79%基线；原始未微调的LLaMA-2-7B模型使WER升至64.58%，表明其无法自主纠正波斯语错误；证明多假设与噪声感知嵌入结合可有效提升波斯语在真实噪声环境中的ASR鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 结合多假设生成与噪声感知的误差级噪声（ELN）表征，能有效增强大语言模型对噪声环境下语音转录错误的判断与纠正能力，显著提升低资源语言（如波斯语）在复杂噪声场景下的自动语音识别性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems suffer significant performance degradation in noisy environments, a challenge that is especially severe for low-resource languages such as Persian. Even state-of-the-art models such as Whisper struggle to maintain accuracy under varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). This study presents a robust noise-sensitive ASR error correction framework that combines multiple hypotheses and noise-aware modeling. Using noisy Persian speech, we generate 5-best hypotheses from a modified Whisper-large decoder. Error Level Noise (ELN) is introduced as a representation that captures semantic- and token-level disagreement across hypotheses, quantifying the linguistic distortions caused by noise. ELN thus provides a direct measure of noise-induced uncertainty, enabling the LLM to reason about the reliability of each hypothesis during correction. Three models are evaluated: (1) a base LLaMA-2-7B model without fine-tuning, (2) a fine-tuned variant trained on text-only hypotheses, and (3) a noise-conditioned model integrating ELN embeddings at both sentence and word levels. Experimental results demonstrate that the ELN-conditioned model achieves substantial reductions in Word Error Rate (WER). Specifically, on the challenging Mixed Noise test set, the proposed Fine-tuned + ELN (Ours) model reduces the WER from a baseline of 31.10\% (Raw Whisper) to 24.84\%, significantly surpassing the Fine-tuned (No ELN) text-only baseline of 30.79\%, whereas the original LLaMA-2-7B model increased the WER to 64.58\%, demonstrating that it is unable to correct Persian errors on its own. This confirms the effectiveness of combining multiple hypotheses with noise-aware embeddings for robust Persian ASR in noisy real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 结合治理感知的数据处理与混合酉型参数高效微调，为低资源多语言场景下的高效、稳定模型适配提供了可行且可扩展的路径，具备良好的实用性与经济性。

Abstract: We present a governance-aware hybrid fine-tuning framework for multilingual, low-resource adaptation of large language models. The core algorithm combines gradient-aligned low-rank updates with structured orthogonal transformations through layer-wise mixing and introduces unitary constraints in selected sub-layers to stabilize deep optimization. In tandem with lightweight, label-free data governance steps, including language identification, near-duplicate removal, and quality filtering, the framework targets accuracy, calibration, and cross-language parity under tight compute budgets. Across XNLI and FLORES, the hybrid approach delivers consistent gains over strong PEFT baselines while maintaining directional balance and improving probability calibration, as shown in Tables II and III. It is more resilient to lightweight orthographic variants, as shown in Table IV, and benefits additively from simple governance steps, as shown in Table V. Training footprint measurements indicate modest overhead and a favorable cost-quality frontier, as shown in Table VI and Figure 2. Together, these results show that hybrid and unitary PEFT provide a stable and accessible path to resource-efficient multilingual adaptation when paired with practical data governance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在学术规模的预训练（如13亿参数、1000亿词元）中，模型表现常受噪声和随机性影响，难以清晰理解架构差异。因此，需要一种可控的实验环境来分离并评估核心模型能力。

Method: 设计受控的合成预训练任务，以隔离和评估语言模型的关键能力；引入Canon Layers作为轻量级架构组件，通过加权求和邻近词元表示实现横向信息流动，并验证其在多种序列架构中的通用性和有效性。

Conclusion: Canon Layers是一种通用且高效的架构增强组件，能够显著提升多种序列模型的推理能力。受控合成预训练提供了一条经济、可靠的方法，用于识别和优化模型核心能力，为未来架构设计和训练策略优化提供了新范式。

Abstract: Understanding architectural differences in language models is challenging, especially at academic-scale pretraining (e.g., 1.3B parameters, 100B tokens), where results are often dominated by noise and randomness. To overcome this, we introduce controlled synthetic pretraining tasks that isolate and evaluate core model capabilities. Within this framework, we discover CANON LAYERS: lightweight architectural components -- named after the musical term "canon" -- that promote horizontal information flow across neighboring tokens. Canon layers compute weighted sums of nearby token representations and integrate seamlessly into Transformers, linear attention, state-space models, or any sequence architecture.
  We present 12 key results. This includes how Canon layers enhance reasoning depth (e.g., by $2\times$), reasoning breadth, knowledge manipulation, etc. They lift weak architectures like NoPE to match RoPE, and linear attention to rival SOTA linear models like Mamba2/GDN -- validated both through synthetic tasks and real-world academic-scale pretraining. This synthetic playground offers an economical, principled path to isolate core model capabilities often obscured at academic scales. Equipped with infinite high-quality data, it may even PREDICT how future architectures will behave as training pipelines improve -- e.g., through better data curation or RL-based post-training -- unlocking deeper reasoning and hierarchical inference.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation tasks. However, their effectiveness heavily relies on supervised training with extensive labeled (e.g., question-answering pairs) or unlabeled datasets (e.g., code snippets), which are often expensive and difficult to obtain at scale. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a method IPC, an unsupervised framework that leverages Internal Probing of LLMs for Code generation without any external corpus, even unlabeled code snippets. We introduce the problem space probing, test understanding probing, solution space probing, and knowledge consolidation and reinforcement to probe the internal knowledge and confidence patterns existing in LLMs. Further, IPC identifies reliable code candidates through self-consistency mechanisms and representation-based quality estimation to train UCoder (coder with unsupervised learning). We validate the proposed approach across multiple code benchmarks, demonstrating that unsupervised methods can achieve competitive performance compared to supervised approaches while significantly reducing the dependency on labeled data and computational resources. Analytic experiments reveal that internal model states contain rich signals about code quality and correctness, and that properly harnessing these signals enables effective unsupervised learning for code generation tasks, opening new directions for training code LLMs in resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) -- the ability to attribute beliefs, desires, and emotions to others -- is fundamental for human social intelligence, yet remains a major challenge for artificial agents. Existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly applied in socially grounded tasks, but their capacity for cross-cultural ToM reasoning is largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce CulturalToM-VQA, a new evaluation benchmark containing 5095 questions designed to probe ToM reasoning across diverse cultural contexts through visual question answering. The dataset captures culturally grounded cues such as rituals, attire, gestures, and interpersonal dynamics, enabling systematic evaluation of ToM reasoning beyond Western-centric benchmarks. Our dataset is built through a VLM-assisted human-in-the-loop pipeline, where human experts first curate culturally rich images across traditions, rituals, and social interactions; a VLM then assist in generating structured ToM-focused scene descriptions, which are refined into question-answer pairs spanning a taxonomy of six ToM tasks and four graded complexity levels. The resulting dataset covers diverse theory of mind facets such as mental state attribution, false belief reasoning, non-literal communication, social norm violations, perspective coordination, and multi-agent reasoning.

Result: 在DAIR-AI数据集上，该方法取得93.5%的宏F1分数，超越当前最优基准，显著优于多个70亿参数级别的大语言模型（如Falcon、Mistral、Qwen、Phi），即使在应用LoRA适配后仍保持优势。整体模型仅595M参数，展现出卓越的参数效率与任务适应性。

Conclusion: 精心设计的小型、多样化、全微调的模型集成，在情感检测等特定自然语言处理任务中，可超越大型语言模型的表现，同时具备更高的参数效率与鲁棒性。这为轻量化高性能NLP系统的设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper introduces a confidence-weighted, credibility-aware ensemble framework for text-based emotion detection, inspired by Condorcet's Jury Theorem (CJT). Unlike conventional ensembles that often rely on homogeneous architectures, our approach combines architecturally diverse small transformer-based large language models (sLLMs) - BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, DeBERTa, and ELECTRA, each fully fine-tuned for emotion classification. To preserve error diversity, we minimize parameter convergence while taking advantage of the unique biases of each model. A dual-weighted voting mechanism integrates both global credibility (validation F1 score) and local confidence (instance-level probability) to dynamically weight model contributions. Experiments on the DAIR-AI dataset demonstrate that our credibility-confidence ensemble achieves a macro F1 score of 93.5 percent, surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks and significantly outperforming large-scale LLMs, including Falcon, Mistral, Qwen, and Phi, even after task-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). With only 595M parameters in total, our small LLMs ensemble proves more parameter-efficient and robust than models up to 7B parameters, establishing that carefully designed ensembles of small, fine-tuned models can outperform much larger LLMs in specialized natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as emotion detection.

Conclusion: 基于五大性格特质的线性方向是有效的性格探测工具，但其在行为引导上的应用受限于上下文依赖性，需谨慎使用，尤其在复杂或自由生成场景中。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit distinct and consistent personalities that greatly impact trust and engagement. While this means that personality frameworks would be highly valuable tools to characterize and control LLMs' behavior, current approaches remain either costly (post-training) or brittle (prompt engineering). Probing and steering via linear directions has recently emerged as a cheap and efficient alternative. In this paper, we investigate whether linear directions aligned with the Big Five personality traits can be used for probing and steering model behavior. Using Llama 3.3 70B, we generate descriptions of 406 fictional characters and their Big Five trait scores. We then prompt the model with these descriptions and questions from the Alpaca questionnaire, allowing us to sample hidden activations that vary along personality traits in known, quantifiable ways. Using linear regression, we learn a set of per-layer directions in activation space, and test their effectiveness for probing and steering model behavior. Our results suggest that linear directions aligned with trait-scores are effective probes for personality detection, while their steering capabilities strongly depend on context, producing reliable effects in forced-choice tasks but limited influence in open-ended generation or when additional context is present in the prompt.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 SimulEval 仓库已不再维护，不支持输出修正，且仅适用于短段落模拟，无法有效评估长音频流上的 StreamST 系统，缺乏便捷的演示方式。

Method: 开发 simulstream 框架，支持长形式语音处理，集成增量解码与重翻译方法，实现统一评估，并提供交互式 Web 界面用于系统展示。

Result: simulstream 实现了对 StreamST 系统的高效、统一评估与可视化演示，支持多种翻译策略的对比，显著提升研究与应用中的可复现性与可展示性。

Conclusion: simulstream 是首个专注于 StreamST 系统评估与演示的开源框架，填补了现有工具在长音频流处理与动态输出支持方面的空白，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Streaming Speech-to-Text Translation (StreamST) requires producing translations concurrently with incoming speech, imposing strict latency constraints and demanding models that balance partial-information decision-making with high translation quality. Research efforts on the topic have so far relied on the SimulEval repository, which is no longer maintained and does not support systems that revise their outputs. In addition, it has been designed for simulating the processing of short segments, rather than long-form audio streams, and it does not provide an easy method to showcase systems in a demo. As a solution, we introduce simulstream, the first open-source framework dedicated to unified evaluation and demonstration of StreamST systems. Designed for long-form speech processing, it supports not only incremental decoding approaches, but also re-translation methods, enabling for their comparison within the same framework both in terms of quality and latency. In addition, it also offers an interactive web interface to demo any system built within the tool.

*Ramaneswaran Selvakumar,Cindy Tseng,Eesung Kim,Vijendra Raj Apsingekar,Yun Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于上下文偏置的注意力编码器-解码器（AED）模型方法，通过候选命名实体列表实现多未来词元的同时预测，使模型能够‘预知未来’并评分潜在候选实体。该方法直接利用多词元预测的逻辑值，无需额外的实体编码器或交叉注意力层，显著降低架构复杂度。在Librispeech数据集上的实验表明，该方法在命名实体词错误率上相比基线AED模型最高提升50.34%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端自动语音识别模型在通用转录任务中表现优异，但在识别罕见或未见过的命名实体（如联系人姓名、地点）方面表现不佳，而这些实体对虚拟助手等下游应用至关重要。因此需要一种有效的方法来增强模型对命名实体的识别能力。

Method: 提出一种上下文偏置方法，利用候选命名实体列表，让AED模型同时预测多个未来词元，从而实现对候选实体的评分；直接使用多词元预测的输出逻辑值，避免引入额外的实体编码器或交叉注意力机制。

Result: 在Librispeech数据集上的实验结果显示，该方法在命名实体词错误率上相比基线模型最高提升了50.34%，显著改善了罕见或未见命名实体的识别性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的上下文偏置方法通过多未来词元预测和直接利用预测逻辑值，在不增加模型复杂度的前提下，显著提升了AED模型对罕见或未见命名实体的识别能力，具有良好的实用价值。

Abstract: While end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) models excel at general transcription, they struggle to recognize rare or unseen named entities (e.g., contact names, locations), which are critical for downstream applications like virtual assistants. In this paper, we propose a contextual biasing method for attention based encoder decoder (AED) models using a list of candidate named entities. Instead of predicting only the next token, we simultaneously predict multiple future tokens, enabling the model to "peek into the future" and score potential candidate entities in the entity list. Moreover, our approach leverages the multi-token prediction logits directly without requiring additional entity encoders or cross-attention layers, significantly reducing architectural complexity. Experiments on Librispeech demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 50.34% relative improvement in named entity word error rate compared to the baseline AED model.

*Lydia Nishimwe,Benoît Sagot,Rachel Bawden*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究分析了用户生成内容（UGC）翻译中的非标准语言现象，提出一个包含12种非标准特征和5种翻译策略（NORMALISE、COPY、TRANSFER、OMIT、CENSOR）的分类体系，并发现不同数据集对UGC处理方式存在差异，导致参考译文在标准化程度上呈现谱系变化。通过大语言模型案例研究，表明翻译评分高度依赖提示词中是否包含明确的UGC翻译指令，且与数据集指南一致时性能提升。研究强调，在保留UGC风格重要时，公平评估需确保模型和评估指标理解并遵循翻译指南，并呼吁在数据集创建阶段制定清晰指南，开发可控制、指南感知的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户生成内容（UGC）常使用非标准语言形式（如拼写错误、俚语、字符重复、表情符号等），使得其翻译评估面临挑战：何为‘好’的翻译取决于输出标准化程度。现有研究缺乏对翻译指南的系统分析，难以实现公平、一致的评估。

Method: 分析四个UGC数据集的人工翻译指南，归纳出12类非标准现象与5种翻译操作；通过案例研究评估大语言模型在不同提示下的翻译表现，检验指南一致性对评分的影响。

Result: 不同数据集对UGC的处理存在显著差异，参考译文在标准化程度上形成连续谱系；大语言模型的翻译评分对提示中是否包含明确指令高度敏感，且与数据集指南一致时表现更优。

Conclusion: 在保留UGC风格的前提下，公平评估必须使模型和评估指标具备对翻译指南的认知；未来应推动建立清晰的数据集创建指南，并发展可控制、指南感知的评估框架。

Abstract: User-generated content (UGC) is characterised by frequent use of non-standard language, from spelling errors to expressive choices such as slang, character repetitions, and emojis. This makes evaluating UGC translation particularly challenging: what counts as a "good" translation depends on the level of standardness desired in the output. To explore this, we examine the human translation guidelines of four UGC datasets, and derive a taxonomy of twelve non-standard phenomena and five translation actions (NORMALISE, COPY, TRANSFER, OMIT, CENSOR). Our analysis reveals notable differences in how UGC is treated, resulting in a spectrum of standardness in reference translations. Through a case study on large language models (LLMs), we show that translation scores are highly sensitive to prompts with explicit translation instructions for UGC, and that they improve when these align with the dataset's guidelines. We argue that when preserving UGC style is important, fair evaluation requires both models and metrics to be aware of translation guidelines. Finally, we call for clear guidelines during dataset creation and for the development of controllable, guideline-aware evaluation frameworks for UGC translation.

Abstract: Work in Computational Affective Science and Computational Social Science explores a wide variety of research questions about people, emotions, behavior, and health. Such work often relies on language data that is first labeled with relevant information, such as the use of emotion words or the age of the speaker. Although many resources and algorithms exist to enable this type of labeling, discovering, accessing, and using them remains a substantial impediment, particularly for practitioners outside of computer science. Here, we present the ABCDE dataset (Affect, Body, Cognition, Demographics, and Emotion), a large-scale collection of over 400 million text utterances drawn from social media, blogs, books, and AI-generated sources. The dataset is annotated with a wide range of features relevant to computational affective and social science. ABCDE facilitates interdisciplinary research across numerous fields, including affective science, cognitive science, the digital humanities, sociology, political science, and computational linguistics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出 AncientBench 基准，用于评估大语言模型在出土古文献中的古文字理解能力，涵盖字形、读音、意义和语境四个维度，包含十项任务，实验表明大模型在古文理解方面潜力巨大但仍不及人类。

Motivation: 现有中文基准多针对现代汉语和传世古文，缺乏对出土古文献中古文字的评估体系，亟需一个专门评估大语言模型在古文字理解能力的基准。

Method: 构建 AncientBench 基准，包含四个维度（字形、读音、意义、语境）和十项具体任务（如部首、形声、同音、填空、翻译等），并邀请考古学者进行评测，以古文字模型为基线，测试当前最优大语言模型的表现。

Result: 实验结果显示，大语言模型在古文字理解方面展现出显著潜力，但在复杂语境理解上仍与人类存在明显差距。

Conclusion: AncientBench 为评估大语言模型在古文字理解方面的能力提供了全面框架，有助于推动大模型在考古学和古汉语研究中的应用与发展。

Abstract: Comprehension of ancient texts plays an important role in archaeology and understanding of Chinese history and civilization. The rapid development of large language models needs benchmarks that can evaluate their comprehension of ancient characters. Existing Chinese benchmarks are mostly targeted at modern Chinese and transmitted documents in ancient Chinese, but the part of excavated documents in ancient Chinese is not covered. To meet this need, we propose the AncientBench, which aims to evaluate the comprehension of ancient characters, especially in the scenario of excavated documents. The AncientBench is divided into four dimensions, which correspond to the four competencies of ancient character comprehension: glyph comprehension, pronunciation comprehension, meaning comprehension, and contextual comprehension. The benchmark also contains ten tasks, including radical, phonetic radical, homophone, cloze, translation, and more, providing a comprehensive framework for evaluation. We convened archaeological researchers to conduct experimental evaluations, proposed an ancient model as baseline, and conducted extensive experiments on the currently best-performing large language models. The experimental results reveal the great potential of large language models in ancient textual scenarios as well as the gap with humans. Our research aims to promote the development and application of large language models in the field of archaeology and ancient Chinese language.

TL;DR: 本研究针对低资源语言Bangla的医学实体识别（MedER）问题，提出了一种新的Multi-BERT Ensemble模型，在性能上超越了BERT、DistilBERT、ELECTRA和RoBERTa等基线模型，准确率达到89.58%，相比单层BERT提升了11.80%。为解决标注数据稀缺的问题，研究构建了一个高质量的Bangla MedER数据集，并通过多指标验证了模型的有效性与鲁棒性。研究结果表明，Multi-BERT Ensemble在低资源医学NLP任务中具有显著潜力，为后续研究奠定了基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言如Bangla在医学实体识别领域研究不足，且缺乏高质量的标注数据，限制了相关自动化医疗系统的发展。因此，亟需开发适用于此类语言的高效模型与数据集以推动医学自然语言处理的进步。

Method: 本研究首先对比分析了多种预训练Transformer模型（包括BERT、DistilBERT、ELECTRA、RoBERTa），并提出一种新型的Multi-BERT Ensemble方法。同时，构建了一个专用于Bangla医学实体识别的高质量标注数据集，用于模型训练与评估。

Result: 所提出的Multi-BERT Ensemble模型在Bangla MedER任务中达到89.58%的准确率，较单层BERT模型提升11.80%，表现出显著优势；所构建的数据集有效支持了模型评估，验证了方法的鲁棒性与适用性。

Conclusion: Multi-BERT Ensemble模型在低资源语言Bangla的医学实体识别任务中表现优异，展现出巨大潜力。本研究不仅提升了该领域的技术能力，也为未来在低资源医学NLP方向的研究提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Medical Entity Recognition (MedER) is an essential NLP task for extracting meaningful entities from the medical corpus. Nowadays, MedER-based research outcomes can remarkably contribute to the development of automated systems in the medical sector, ultimately enhancing patient care and outcomes. While extensive research has been conducted on MedER in English, low-resource languages like Bangla remain underexplored. Our work aims to bridge this gap. For Bangla medical entity recognition, this study first examined a number of transformer models, including BERT, DistilBERT, ELECTRA, and RoBERTa. We also propose a novel Multi-BERT Ensemble approach that outperformed all baseline models with the highest accuracy of 89.58%. Notably, it provides an 11.80% accuracy improvement over the single-layer BERT model, demonstrating its effectiveness for this task. A major challenge in MedER for low-resource languages is the lack of annotated datasets. To address this issue, we developed a high-quality dataset tailored for the Bangla MedER task. The dataset was used to evaluate the effectiveness of our model through multiple performance metrics, demonstrating its robustness and applicability. Our findings highlight the potential of Multi-BERT Ensemble models in improving MedER for Bangla and set the foundation for further advancements in low-resource medical NLP.

### [106] [DEER: A Comprehensive and Reliable Benchmark for Deep-Research Expert Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17776)
*Janghoon Han,Heegyu Kim,Changho Lee,Dahm Lee,Min Hyung Park,Hosung Song,Stanley Jungkyu Choi,Moontae Lee,Honglak Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DEER is a benchmark for evaluating expert-level deep research reports, featuring 50 tasks across 13 domains, a detailed 7-dimensional evaluation taxonomy with 25 sub-dimensions and 130 rubric items, task-specific expert guidance, and a document-level fact-checking architecture that verifies all claims—cited and uncited—for external evidence quality. It aligns closely with human expert judgments and provides interpretable diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack systematic criteria for expert reporting, rely too heavily on LLM judges who may miss nuanced issues requiring expert judgment, and perform limited source verification focused only on explicitly cited statements rather than overall factual reliability in reports.

Method: DEER introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework including a domain-diverse set of report-writing tasks, an expert-grounded taxonomy with fine-grained rubrics, expert guidance for LLM judges, and a document-level fact-checking system that extracts and verifies all claims across the entire report using external evidence.

Result: DEER demonstrates strong correlation with human expert judgments, enables consistent and interpretable assessment of LLM-generated reports, and reveals detailed diagnostics about system strengths and weaknesses.

Conclusion: DEER offers a robust, scalable, and expert-aligned benchmark for evaluating deep research reports, addressing key limitations in current evaluation practices by combining structured rubrics with comprehensive fact-checking across the full text.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, deep research systems can generate expert-level reports via multi-step reasoning and evidence-based synthesis, but evaluating such reports remains challenging. Existing benchmarks often lack systematic criteria for expert reporting, evaluations that rely heavily on LLM judges can fail to capture issues that require expert judgment, and source verification typically covers only a limited subset of explicitly cited statements rather than report-wide factual reliability. We introduce DEER, a benchmark for evaluating expert-level deep research reports. DEER comprises 50 report-writing tasks spanning 13 domains and an expert-grounded evaluation taxonomy (7 dimensions, 25 sub-dimension) operationalized into 130 fine-grained rubric items. DEER further provides task-specific expert guidance to help LLM judges assess expert-level report quality more consistently. Complementing rubric-based assessment, we propose a document-level fact-checking architecture that extracts and verifies all claims across the entire report, including both cited and uncited ones, and quantifies external-evidence quality. DEER correlates closely with human expert judgments and yields interpretable diagnostics of system strengths and weaknesses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公开数据集将大语言模型视为通用文本生成器，忽略了界面设计对用户交互的实际影响。为了更真实地反映用户与不同平台大模型的互动过程，需要一种能保留平台特有功能和交互上下文的数据集。

Method: 从五个主流平台收集公开分享的对话链接，构建包含多语言、多类型交互内容的大规模语料库；通过结构化方式保留推理轨迹、源链接、代码等原生平台功能信息；并进行时间跨度长达两年的数据采集。

Result: ShareChat 包含 142,808 条对话、660,000 多轮交互，支持 101 种语言，具有更长上下文和更深交互；可用于分析对话完成度、源引用行为及使用趋势演化，验证其在真实场景下的有效性与多样性。

Conclusion: ShareChat 为研究真实世界中用户与大模型的交互提供了高质量、多维度、跨平台的数据基础，填补了当前数据集在界面上下文保留方面的空白，具有重要的学术与应用价值。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into distinct platforms with unique interface designs and capabilities, existing public datasets treat models as generic text generators, stripping away the interface context that actively shapes user interaction. To address this limitation, we present ShareChat, a large-scale, cross-platform corpus comprising 142,808 conversations and over 660,000 turns collected from publicly shared URLs across five major platforms: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, and Grok. ShareChat distinguishes itself by preserving native platform affordances often lost in standard logs, including reasoning traces, source links, and code artifacts, while spanning 101 languages over the period from April 2023 to October 2025. Furthermore, ShareChat offers substantially longer context windows and greater interaction depth than prior datasets. We demonstrate the dataset's multifaceted utility through three representative analyses: (1) analyzing conversation completeness to measure user intent satisfaction; (2) evaluating source citation behaviors in content generation; and (3) conducting temporal analysis to track evolving usage patterns. This work provides the community with a vital and timely resource for understanding authentic user-LLM chatbot interactions in the wild.

*Kwangjun Ahn,Noah Amsel,John Langford*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dion2 提出一种简化方法，通过在每次迭代中选择部分行或列进行正交化，从而减少 Muon 优化器中正交化步骤的矩阵规模，实现计算和通信成本的降低，提升可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon 优化器虽然有良好的经验表现和理论基础，但其正交化步骤具有超线性开销，随规模增加而加剧。现有方法尝试减小进入正交化步骤的矩阵大小，但仍有改进空间。

Method: Dion2 在每次迭代中仅对随机选择的部分行或列进行正交化，通过采样使更新稀疏，从而降低计算与通信开销。

Result: 该方法显著降低了计算和通信成本，提升了 Muon 优化器在大规模场景下的可扩展性。

Conclusion: Dion2 是一种简单且高效的方法，有效缓解了 Muon 优化器因正交化步骤带来的性能瓶颈，适用于大规模优化任务。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer enjoys strong empirical performance and theoretical grounding. However, the super-linear cost of its orthonormalization step introduces increasing overhead with scale. To alleviate this cost, several works have attempted to reduce the size of the matrix entering the orthonormalization step. We introduce Dion2, a much simpler method for shrinking the matrix involved in Muon's computation compared to prior approaches. At a high level, Dion2 selects a fraction of rows or columns at each iteration and orthonormalizes only those. This sampling procedure makes the update sparse, reducing both computation and communication costs which in turn improves the scalability of Muon.

Abstract: Affordable upper-limb prostheses often lack intuitive control systems, limiting functionality and accessibility for amputees in low-resource settings. This project presents a low-cost, dual-mode neuro-muscular control system integrating electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) to enable real-time, multi-degree-of-freedom control of a prosthetic arm. EEG signals are acquired using the NeuroSky MindWave Mobile 2 and transmitted via ThinkGear Bluetooth packets to an ESP32 microcontroller running a lightweight classification model. The model was trained on 1500 seconds of recorded EEG data using a 6-frame sliding window with low-pass filtering, excluding poor-signal samples and using a 70/20/10 training--validation--test split. The classifier detects strong blink events, which toggle the hand between open and closed states. EMG signals are acquired using a MyoWare 2.0 sensor and SparkFun wireless shield and transmitted to a second ESP32, which performs threshold-based detection. Three activation bands (rest: 0--T1; extension: T1--T2; contraction: greater than T2) enable intuitive elbow control, with movement triggered only after eight consecutive frames in a movement class to improve stability. The EEG-controlled ESP32 actuates four finger servos, while the EMG-controlled ESP32 drives two elbow servos. A functional prototype was constructed using low-cost materials (total cost approximately 240 dollars), with most expense attributed to the commercial EEG headset. Future work includes transitioning to a 3D-printed chassis, integrating auto-regressive models to reduce EMG latency, and upgrading servo torque for improved load capacity and grip strength. This system demonstrates a feasible pathway to low-cost, biologically intuitive prosthetic control suitable for underserved and global health applications.

Abstract: Short-term prediction (nowcasting) of low-visibility and precipitation events is critical for aviation safety and operational efficiency. Current operational approaches rely on computationally intensive numerical weather prediction guidance and human-issued TAF products, which often exhibit conservative biases and limited temporal resolution. This study presents a lightweight gradient boosting framework (XGBoost) trained exclusively on surface observation data (METAR) and enhanced through physics-guided feature engineering based on thermodynamic principles. The framework is evaluated across 11 international airports representing distinct climatic regimes (including SCEL, KJFK, KORD, KDEN, SBGR, and VIDP) using historical data from 2000 to 2024. Results suggest that the model successfully captures underlying local physical processes without manual configuration. In a blind comparative evaluation against operational TAF forecasts, the automated model achieved substantially higher detection rates at tactical horizons (3 hours), with a 2.5 to 4.0 times improvement in recall while reducing false alarms. Furthermore, SHAP analysis reveals that the model performs an implicit reconstruction of local physical drivers (advection, radiation, and subsidence), providing actionable explainability for operational situational awareness.

Motivation: 在实际场景中，完全观测样本难以获取，而部分且含噪的观测相对容易收集。如何利用大量噪声样本恢复真实分布成为关键挑战，尤其当污染过程已知但非高斯时，现有方法受限。因此需要一种通用、鲁棒且能结合少量干净样本的分布恢复方法。

Method: 将分布恢复建模为一维熵最优传输问题，设计一种类似EM的迭代算法求解；提出可恢复性判别准则，用于判断在每样本信息丢失情况下的可恢复性；引入桥接模型框架SFBD-OMNI，实现从噪声分布到真实分布的映射，支持任意测量模型（非仅限高斯）。

Result: 所提方法在多种噪声模型和基准数据集上均取得显著优于现有方法的性能，不仅提升了重建质量，还具备良好的泛化能力；在缺乏干净样本时仍可判断可恢复性，少量清洁样本即可大幅改善恢复效果。

Conclusion: SFBD-OMNI提供了一种高效、通用的分布恢复框架，能够有效应对复杂噪声环境，突破传统方法对高斯假设的依赖，为现实世界中的不完全观测问题提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, obtaining fully observed samples is prohibitively expensive or even infeasible, while partial and noisy observations are comparatively easy to collect. In this work, we study distribution restoration with abundant noisy samples, assuming the corruption process is available as a black-box generator. We show that this task can be framed as a one-sided entropic optimal transport problem and solved via an EM-like algorithm. We further provide a test criterion to determine whether the true underlying distribution is recoverable under per-sample information loss, and show that in otherwise unrecoverable cases, a small number of clean samples can render the distribution largely recoverable. Building on these insights, we introduce SFBD-OMNI, a bridge model-based framework that maps corrupted sample distributions to the ground-truth distribution. Our method generalizes Stochastic Forward-Backward Deconvolution (SFBD; Lu et al., 2025) to handle arbitrary measurement models beyond Gaussian corruption. Experiments across benchmark datasets and diverse measurement settings demonstrate significant improvements in both qualitative and quantitative performance.

*Vladimir G. Pestov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明了在完备可分度量空间中，k近邻分类器的（弱）普遍一致性、强Lebesgue-Besicovitch微分性质对每个局部有限Borel测度成立、以及空间在Nagata意义下是σ有限维的三个条件之间的等价性，完成了最后一个缺失的蕴含关系(1)⇒(3)，并纠正了先前文献中的一个错误主张。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了建立k近邻分类器在一般度量空间中的普遍一致性与空间几何性质之间的深刻联系，特别是与测度论和维度理论相关的性质，从而完成三者等价性的完整证明。

Method: 通过分析k近邻分类器的收敛行为，结合测度论中的微分性质及空间的维度结构，采用拓扑与分析相结合的方法，构造反例并推导出必要条件，最终证明从(1)推出(3)。

Result: 成功证明了(1)⇒(3)，从而确立了三个条件的完全等价性，并修正了前人工作中存在的错误陈述。

Conclusion: 在完备可分度量空间中，k近邻分类器的弱普遍一致性、强Lebesgue-Besicovitch微分性质以及σ有限维性三者等价，这一结果深化了对机器学习算法泛化能力与空间几何结构之间关系的理解。

Abstract: We prove the last remaining implication allowing to claim the equivalence of the following conditions for a complete separable metric space $X$:
  (1) The $k$-nearest neighbour classifier is (weakly) universally consistent in $X$, (2) The strong Lebesgue--Besicovitch differentiation property holds in $X$ for every locally finite Borel measure, (3) $X$ is sigma-finite dimensional in the sense of Nagata.
  The equivalence (2)$\iff$(3) was announced by Preiss (1983), while a detailed proof of the implication (3)$\Rightarrow$(2) has appeared in Assouad and Quentin de Gromard (2006). The implication (2)$\Rightarrow$(1) was established by Cérou and Guyader (2006). We prove the implication (1)$\Rightarrow$(3). The result was conjectured in the first article in the series (Collins, Kumari, Pestov 2020), and here we also correct a wrong claim made in the second article (Kumari and Pestov 2024).

*Zhenyu Liu,Yunzhen Liu,Zehao Fan,Garrett Gagnon,Yayue Hou,Nan Wu,Yangwook Kang,Liu Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于低秩补偿的带宽高效自适应混合专家（MoE）方法，通过路由器引导的精度恢复，在推理时仅传输前n个（n<k）专家的紧凑低秩因子，并对它们进行补偿，其余专家保持低比特表示。该方法结合GPU与GPU-NDP系统的卸载机制，显著提升了带宽与准确率之间的权衡及吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型虽可通过稀疏激活扩展容量，但带来内存和带宽压力；现有卸载技术因逐令牌路由导致不规则传输，使推理成为I/O瓶颈；静态均匀量化虽减少数据流量，但在高压缩下因忽略专家异质性而降低准确率。

Method: 提出路由器引导的精度恢复机制，利用预先计算的低秩补偿因子，在推理阶段仅传输部分专家的紧凑低秩因子，并对这些因子进行补偿，其余专家保持低比特表示，从而实现高效带宽利用与精度保持的平衡。

Result: 在集成卸载于GPU和GPU-NDP系统后，该方法在带宽-准确率权衡上表现更优，同时显著提升推理吞吐量。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效缓解了MoE模型在推理中的带宽瓶颈问题，兼顾了压缩效率与模型精度，适用于大规模稀疏激活模型的高效部署。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale capacity via sparse activation but stress memory and bandwidth. Offloading alleviates GPU memory by fetching experts on demand, yet token-level routing causes irregular transfers that make inference I/O-bound. Static uniform quantization reduces traffic but degrades accuracy under aggressive compression by ignoring expert heterogeneity. We present Bandwidth-Efficient Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts via Low-Rank Compensation, which performs router-guided precision restoration using precomputed low-rank compensators. At inference time, our method transfers compact low-rank factors with Top-n (n<k) experts per token and applies compensation to them, keeping others low-bit. Integrated with offloading on GPU and GPU-NDP systems, our method delivers a superior bandwidth-accuracy trade-off and improved throughput.

*Saraswathy Amjith,Mihika Dusad,Neha Muramalla,Shweta Shah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了通过在训练中引入故意包含错误的思维链（CoT）轨迹，是否能提升大语言模型在数学推理中的错误检测与恢复能力。实验使用MATH-lighteval竞赛级问题，生成带有单一可控错误的CoT前缀（计算错误或推理错误），并基于二元最终答案奖励对Qwen3-4B模型进行GRPO微调。结果表明，混合错误训练模型（Mixed-CoT-RL）在干净问题上表现与标准强化学习相当（41% vs 41%），但在含错误预填充的问题上显著更优（24% vs 19%）。而仅在干净数据上训练的模型反而降低了鲁棒性（19% vs 20%），说明传统训练可能使模型更易受误导。其中，针对推理错误的训练带来的鲁棒性提升优于仅针对计算错误，混合训练效果最佳。研究证明，接触有缺陷的推理过程有助于提升模型的容错能力而不牺牲准确性，为构建更稳健的数学推理大模型提供了新路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在数学推理中对早期错误极为敏感，一个微小的算术失误或逻辑跳跃会持续传播导致最终答案错误。尽管链式思考（CoT）提示已成主流，但模型缺乏自我纠错能力。因此，亟需探索如何让模型学会识别并纠正这些错误，同时不损害其在标准问题上的准确率。

Method: 在MATH-lighteval数据集上生成含有单一控制错误（计算错误或推理错误）的链式思考前缀；使用GRPO算法，以最终答案正确与否作为二元奖励信号，对Qwen3-4B模型进行微调；对比混合错误训练（Mixed-CoT-RL）、仅干净数据训练及未微调基线模型在干净和含错问题上的表现。

Result: Mixed-CoT-RL模型在干净问题上保持高准确率（41%），在含错误问题上显著优于标准强化学习（24% vs 19%）；仅在干净数据上训练的模型鲁棒性下降至19%，低于未微调基线的20%；推理错误训练带来的鲁棒性提升大于计算错误训练，混合训练效果最优。

Conclusion: 在训练中引入包含错误的推理轨迹可有效提升大语言模型在数学推理中的错误检测与恢复能力，且不会降低其在正常任务上的表现。这表明通过混合错误训练可实现更鲁棒的数学推理系统，为未来模型可靠性提升提供可行策略。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has become central to mathematical reasoning in large language models, yet models remain brittle to early errors: a single arithmetic slip or unjustified inference typically propagates uncorrected to an incorrect final answer. We investigate whether training on intentionally flawed reasoning traces can teach models to detect and recover from such errors without degrading standard problem-solving ability. Using competition-level problems from MATH-lighteval, we generate CoT prefixes containing exactly one controlled error, either a calculation error (sign flips, dropped terms) or a reasoning error (misapplied rules, unjustified logical steps), and fine-tune Qwen3-4B with GRPO using a binary final-answer reward. Our Mixed-CoT-RL model matches standard RL on clean problems (41% vs 41%) while substantially outperforming it on problems prefilled with flawed reasoning (24% vs 19%). Notably, clean-only RL fine-tuning degrades robustness below the untuned baseline 19% vs. 20%), indicating that conventional training increases susceptibility to misleading prefills. Among error types, training on reasoning errors yields greater robustness gains than calculation errors alone, with mixed training performing best. These findings demonstrate that exposure to flawed traces during training can improve error-recovery behavior without sacrificing accuracy, suggesting a path toward more robust mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种融合强化学习与模型预测控制（MPC）的层次化规划新方法，通过将强化学习动作用于指导MPPI采样，并自适应地聚合MPPI样本以改进价值估计，实现了在价值估计不确定时增强探索，提升了训练鲁棒性和策略性能。该方法在赛车驾驶、改进型Acrobot和带障碍物的Lunar Lander等任务中表现出更高的数据效率、更好的奖励表现和任务成功率，成功率达72%提升，收敛速度加快2.1倍。

Motivation: 现有规划方法在处理复杂任务时存在数据效率低、训练不稳定和难以适应不同应用的问题，亟需一种能够结合强化学习灵活性与MPC精确性并实现自适应优化的新框架。

Method: 提出一种紧密耦合强化学习与MPPI采样的新架构：利用强化学习输出的动作指导MPPI采样过程，同时根据采样结果自适应调整价值函数估计，实现不确定性区域的主动探索与策略优化。

Result: 在多个复杂环境中验证了该方法的有效性，相比现有方法，任务成功率最高提升72%，收敛速度提高2.1倍，且具备良好的泛化能力与应用适应性。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效融合了强化学习与模型预测控制的优势，构建了一个自适应、高效且鲁棒的规划系统，适用于多种复杂动态环境下的决策任务。

Abstract: We propose a new approach for solving planning problems with a hierarchical structure, fusing reinforcement learning and MPC planning. Our formulation tightly and elegantly couples the two planning paradigms. It leverages reinforcement learning actions to inform the MPPI sampler, and adaptively aggregates MPPI samples to inform the value estimation. The resulting adaptive process leverages further MPPI exploration where value estimates are uncertain, and improves training robustness and the overall resulting policies. This results in a robust planning approach that can handle complex planning problems and easily adapts to different applications, as demonstrated over several domains, including race driving, modified Acrobot, and Lunar Lander with added obstacles. Our results in these domains show better data efficiency and overall performance in terms of both rewards and task success, with up to a 72% increase in success rate compared to existing approaches, as well as accelerated convergence (x2.1) compared to non-adaptive sampling.

Motivation: 现有视频-语言模型在移动端执行多阶段任务时面临模型重复加载和执行碎片化问题，导致效率低下，亟需一种高效的系统级解决方案。

Method: 将百亿参数模型分解为可复用的模块（如视觉编码器、语言解码器），通过模块复用支持跨子任务并行执行，消除冗余加载，优化整体执行流程。

Result: 在普通智能手机上，端到端执行速度提升27--33%，性能损失微小（检索召回率下降≤2.3，摘要生成得分下降≤1.5），证明了该方法在效率与精度间的良好平衡。

Conclusion: Atom提供了一种实用且可扩展的方案，显著提升了视频-语言理解在边缘设备上的执行效率，具备广泛部署潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in video-language models have enabled powerful applications like video retrieval, captioning, and assembly. However, executing such multi-stage pipelines efficiently on mobile devices remains challenging due to redundant model loads and fragmented execution. We introduce Atom, an on-device system that restructures video-language pipelines for fast and efficient execution. Atom decomposes a billion-parameter model into reusable modules, such as the visual encoder and language decoder, and reuses them across subtasks like captioning, reasoning, and indexing. This reuse-centric design eliminates repeated model loading and enables parallel execution, reducing end-to-end latency without sacrificing performance. On commodity smartphones, Atom achieves 27--33% faster execution compared to non-reuse baselines, with only marginal performance drop ($\leq$ 2.3 Recall@1 in retrieval, $\leq$ 1.5 CIDEr in captioning). These results position Atom as a practical, scalable approach for efficient video-language understanding on edge devices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究评估了斯坦福AIMI CheXagent模型在使用含否定和不含否定的提示词检索胸部X光片时的表现，发现其在处理否定短语时表现不佳。通过基于先前工作的微调方法对模型进行改进，结果显示模型在处理否定语句方面有所提升，但正面提示词的准确率略有下降。同时，通过词元归因、t-SNE投影和注意力头消融分析，研究揭示了不同微调策略如何重塑文本编码器对临床否定语言的表征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP等大型视觉-语言模型虽在医学影像任务中表现出色，但在解释否定短语方面存在不足，这在临床诊断中尤为关键，因此亟需改进模型对否定语言的理解能力以提高其可靠性。

Method: 采用斯坦福AIMI CheXagent模型，对比其在含否定与不含否定提示下的图像检索性能；通过已有微调方法对其进行优化，并结合词元归因、t-SNE降维及注意力头消融分析，探究模型内部表征变化。

Result: 微调后模型在处理否定提示时的检索准确率得到提升，但正向提示的准确率略有下降；内部分析表明，不同微调策略显著改变了文本编码器对否定临床语言的表示方式。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了CLIP模型在处理医学否定语言中的局限性，并通过微调有效提升了其对否定语义的理解能力，为构建更可靠、可解释的医疗AI系统提供了重要依据。

Abstract: Large vision-language models like CLIP are increasingly used in medical imaging tasks due to their ability to align images and text without the need for extensive labeled data. This makes them particularly useful for applications like image retrieval, report generation, and classification in clinical settings. A potential issue to this approach is that CLIP-based models often under perform when interpreting negated phrases, which is especially problematic in the context of medical diagnosing. In this study, we evaluate the Stanford AIMI CheXagent model on its ability to correctly retrieve chest X-ray images using prompts with and without negation. The goal of this project is to understand where this model fails and then use it as a base model to improve its retrieval accuracy by fine tuning methods outlined in previous work. Results from this study show improvement in handling of negation in the CLIP model with a slight decrease in accuracy of positive prompt evaluation. Alongside retrieval accuracy, we examined internal model behavior through token attribution, t-SNE projection, and attention-head ablation to better characterize how each fine tuning approach reshaped the text encoders representation of negated clinical language. Through this work, we hope to better understand the internal behavior of CLIP and improve its handling of negation using clinically relevant language for improving its reliability in medical AI devices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GPA 是 Nesterov 方法在原始平均形式上的扩展，解决了近期基于平均的优化器（如单工作节点 DiLoCo 和 Schedule-Free）在非分布式设置下的关键局限性。它通过解耦原始平均中的插值常数，实现了每一步的平滑迭代平均，从而避免了 DiLoCo 的双循环结构，简化了超参数调优并降低了内存开销。实证结果显示，GPA 在 Llama-160M 上比 AdamW 快 24.22%，在 ImageNet ViT 任务中分别在小批量和大批量设置下提升 12% 和 27% 的收敛速度。理论证明表明，对于任何后悔界为 $O(\sqrt{T})$ 的基础优化器，GPA 能匹配或超越原优化器的收敛保证。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于平均的优化器（如 DiLoCo 和 Schedule-Free）在非分布式场景下的局限性，包括双循环结构带来的高内存消耗、复杂超参数调优以及周期性平均导致的性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出 Generalized Primal Averaging (GPA)，通过解耦 Nesterov 原始平均公式中的插值常数，实现每步平滑迭代平均，替代原有的周期性或显式平均策略，同时保持与基础优化器兼容性。

Result: GPA 在多个基准任务上显著优于单工作节点 DiLoCo，实现更高收敛速度：在 Llama-160M 上提升 24.22%，在 ImageNet ViT 小/大批量设置下分别提升 12% 和 27%；同时减少内存占用至仅需一个额外缓冲区，且无需复杂的双循环结构。

Conclusion: GPA 是一种高效、简洁且可扩展的优化方法，通过解耦插值常数实现更优的迭代平均机制，在理论和实践中均优于现有方法，适用于广泛的基础优化器。

Abstract: We propose Generalized Primal Averaging (GPA), an extension of Nesterov's method in its primal averaging formulation that addresses key limitations of recent averaging-based optimizers such as single-worker DiLoCo and Schedule-Free (SF) in the non-distributed setting. These two recent algorithmic approaches improve the performance of base optimizers, such as AdamW, through different iterate averaging strategies. Schedule-Free explicitly maintains a uniform average of past weights, while single-worker DiLoCo performs implicit averaging by periodically aggregating trajectories, called pseudo-gradients, to update the model parameters. However, single-worker DiLoCo's periodic averaging introduces a two-loop structure, increasing its memory requirements and number of hyperparameters. GPA overcomes these limitations by decoupling the interpolation constant in the primal averaging formulation of Nesterov. This decoupling enables GPA to smoothly average iterates at every step, generalizing and improving upon single-worker DiLoCo. Empirically, GPA consistently outperforms single-worker DiLoCo while removing the two-loop structure, simplifying hyperparameter tuning, and reducing its memory overhead to a single additional buffer. On the Llama-160M model, GPA provides a 24.22% speedup in terms of steps to reach the baseline (AdamW's) validation loss. Likewise, GPA achieves speedups of 12% and 27% on small and large batch setups, respectively, to attain AdamW's validation accuracy on the ImageNet ViT workload. Furthermore, we prove that for any base optimizer with regret bounded by $O(\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the number of iterations, GPA can match or exceed the convergence guarantee of the original optimizer, depending on the choice of interpolation constants.

*Shao-Ting Chiu,Ioannis G. Kevrekidis,Ulisses Braga-Neto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BumpNet is a sparse neural network framework for solving PDEs and learning operators, using sigmoid-based basis functions that are fully trainable. It enables efficient training, model parsimony, and h-adaptivity via dynamic pruning. Combined with PINNs, EDNNs, and DeepONet, it forms Bump-PINNs, Bump-EDNN, and Bump-DeepONet, showing high efficiency and accuracy in numerical experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more efficient and adaptable neural network framework for solving PDEs and learning operators, overcoming limitations of traditional RBF networks and improving training efficiency and model sparsity.

Method: BumpNet uses meshless basis functions derived from sigmoid activations, allowing full trainability of shape, location, and amplitude. Basis functions are pruned dynamically during training to achieve sparsity and adaptivity. It integrates with PINNs, EDNNs, and DeepONet for different PDE tasks.

Result: Extensive numerical experiments show that BumpNet and its variants (Bump-PINNs, Bump-EDNN, Bump-DeepONet) achieve high accuracy and computational efficiency in solving various PDEs and operator learning tasks.

Conclusion: BumpNet provides a flexible, efficient, and adaptive framework for PDE solution and operator learning, enabling improved performance through trainable, prunable basis functions and integration with existing neural architectures.

Abstract: We introduce BumpNet, a sparse neural network framework for PDE numerical solution and operator learning. BumpNet is based on meshless basis function expansion, in a similar fashion to radial-basis function (RBF) networks. Unlike RBF networks, the basis functions in BumpNet are constructed from ordinary sigmoid activation functions. This enables the efficient use of modern training techniques optimized for such networks. All parameters of the basis functions, including shape, location, and amplitude, are fully trainable. Model parsimony and h-adaptivity are effectively achieved through dynamically pruning basis functions during training. BumpNet is a general framework that can be combined with existing neural architectures for learning PDE solutions: here, we propose Bump-PINNs (BumpNet with physics-informed neural networks) for solving general PDEs; Bump-EDNN (BumpNet with evolutionary deep neural networks) to solve time-evolution PDEs; and Bump-DeepONet (BumpNet with deep operator networks) for PDE operator learning. Bump-PINNs are trained using the same collocation-based approach used by PINNs, Bump-EDNN uses a BumpNet only in the spatial domain and uses EDNNs to advance the solution in time, while Bump-DeepONets employ a BumpNet regression network as the trunk network of a DeepONet. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed architecture.

Abstract: With the growing popularity of electric vehicles as a means of addressing climate change, concerns have emerged regarding their impact on electric grid management. As a result, predicting EV charging demand has become a timely and important research problem. While substantial research has addressed energy load forecasting in transportation, relatively few studies systematically compare multiple forecasting methods across different temporal horizons and spatial aggregation levels in diverse urban settings. This work investigates the effectiveness of five time series forecasting models, ranging from traditional statistical approaches to machine learning and deep learning methods. Forecasting performance is evaluated for short-, mid-, and long-term horizons (on the order of minutes, hours, and days, respectively), and across spatial scales ranging from individual charging stations to regional and city-level aggregations. The analysis is conducted on four publicly available real-world datasets, with results reported independently for each dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically evaluate EV charging demand forecasting across such a wide range of temporal horizons and spatial aggregation levels using multiple real-world datasets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为基于推理的有效互信息差异（R-EMID）的信息论度量方法，用于以可解释的方式衡量角色扮演模型（RPMs）在部署时的性能退化。通过推导R-EMID的上界，理论揭示了用户、角色和对话组合等分布偏移对RPM泛化能力的影响机制。同时，提出一种协同进化强化学习框架，以自适应建模用户、角色与对话上下文之间的关系，提升对话响应生成概率的估计精度，从而支持R-EMID计算。实验表明，用户偏移是导致性能下降的最大风险因素，而强化学习是最有效的泛化增强方法。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法如LLM-as-a-judge无法对角色扮演模型在真实场景下的性能退化进行细粒度诊断，缺乏系统性框架来刻画其泛化行为，因此亟需一种可解释且理论严谨的评估与分析工具。

Method: 提出R-EMID度量，结合理论推导的上界分析分布偏移的影响；设计协同进化强化学习框架，动态建模用户、角色与对话上下文的关系，优化响应生成概率估计。

Result: 实验验证了R-EMID的有效性，发现用户分布偏移对RPM性能影响最大，强化学习方法在提升泛化能力方面表现最优。

Conclusion: R-EMID为角色扮演模型的性能退化提供了可解释的度量方式，理论分析揭示了各类分布偏移的作用机制，协同进化强化学习显著提升了模型在复杂场景下的泛化能力。

Abstract: Role-playing models (RPMs) are widely used in real-world applications but underperform when deployed in the wild. This degradation can be attributed to distribution shifts, including user, character, and dialogue compositional shifts. Existing methods like LLM-as-a-judge fall short in providing a fine-grained diagnosis of how these shifts affect RPM generalization, and thus there lack formal frameworks to characterize RPM generalization behaviors. To bridge these gaps, we introduce an information-theoretic metric, named reasoning-based effective mutual information difference (R-EMID), to measure RPM performance degradation in an interpretable way. We also derive an upper bound on R-EMID to predict the worst-case generalization performance of RPMs and theoretically reveal how various shifts contribute to the RPM performance degradation. Moreover, we propose a co-evolving reinforcement learning framework to adaptively model the connection among user, character, and dialogue context and thus enhance the estimation of dialogue response generation probability, which is critical for calculating R-EMID. Finally, we evaluate the generalization performance of various RPMs using R-EMID, finding that user shift poses the highest risk among all shifts and reinforcement learning is the most effective approach for enhancing RPM generalization.

*Alireza Moayedikia,Sara Fin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MATCH-AD is a semi-supervised framework that combines deep learning, graph-based label propagation, and optimal transport theory to improve Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using limited labeled neuroimaging data. It achieves near-perfect accuracy on a large dataset with less than one-third labeled subjects, outperforming all baselines with strong theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical assessments for Alzheimer's disease are expensive and invasive, resulting in sparse ground truth labels in neuroimaging datasets. This limits the effectiveness of machine learning models. The need arises to leverage unlabeled data effectively while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.

Method: MATCH-AD integrates deep representation learning to extract features from heterogeneous data (MRI, CSF, clinical variables), uses graph-based label propagation to transfer labels from few labeled to many unlabeled samples, and applies optimal transport (Wasserstein distances) to model disease progression across cognitive states.

Result: On nearly 5,000 subjects from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, MATCH-AD achieved near-perfect diagnostic accuracy despite fewer than one-third of subjects having ground truth labels. It significantly outperformed baseline methods, achieving almost perfect agreement (high kappa) versus weak agreement in the best baseline. Performance remains robust under severe label scarcity, with proven theoretical bounds on error and transport stability.

Conclusion: MATCH-AD demonstrates that principled semi-supervised learning can unlock the potential of large, partially labeled neuroimaging datasets, drastically reducing annotation burden while enabling clinically reliable diagnosis, paving the way for scalable and accurate AD detection systems.

Abstract: Machine learning approaches for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis face a fundamental challenges. Clinical assessments are expensive and invasive, leaving ground truth labels available for only a fraction of neuroimaging datasets. We introduce Multi view Adaptive Transport Clustering for Heterogeneous Alzheimer's Disease (MATCH-AD), a semi supervised framework that integrates deep representation learning, graph-based label propagation, and optimal transport theory to address this limitation. The framework leverages manifold structure in neuroimaging data to propagate diagnostic information from limited labeled samples to larger unlabeled populations, while using Wasserstein distances to quantify disease progression between cognitive states. Evaluated on nearly five thousand subjects from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, encompassing structural MRI measurements from hundreds of brain regions, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and clinical variables MATCHAD achieves near-perfect diagnostic accuracy despite ground truth labels for less than one-third of subjects. The framework substantially outperforms all baseline methods, achieving kappa indicating almost perfect agreement compared to weak agreement for the best baseline, a qualitative transformation in diagnostic reliability. Performance remains clinically useful even under severe label scarcity, and we provide theoretical convergence guarantees with proven bounds on label propagation error and transport stability. These results demonstrate that principled semi-supervised learning can unlock the diagnostic potential of the vast repositories of partially annotated neuroimaging data accumulating worldwide, substantially reducing annotation burden while maintaining accuracy suitable for clinical deployment.

### [124] [Explanation Beyond Intuition: A Testable Criterion for Inherent Explainability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17316)
*Michael Merry,Pat Riddle,Jim Warren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出一个全局适用的固有可解释性标准，利用图论对模型进行结构局部解释与重组，形成可验证的假设-证据注释，以支持多种解释方法。该标准与现有直觉一致，并能区分可解释模型与已解释模型。通过完整解释临床使用的PREDICT心血管疾病风险模型，证明其具备固有可解释性，为可解释性研究提供形式化框架，便于监管合规评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可解释人工智能（XAI）缺乏统一定义或测试来证明模型的固有可解释性，现有工作依赖指标或直觉判断，存在主观性和不一致性。需要一种客观、通用的标准来界定和验证模型是否真正可解释。

Method: 采用图论构建模型的结构表示，实现结构局部解释的分解与全局解释的重组；将解释形式化为可验证的假设-证据注释结构，支持多种解释方法；通过案例分析验证标准的有效性。

Result: 提出的准则能够合理区分可解释与已解释模型，成功应用于实际临床模型PREDICT，证明其固有可解释性；为可解释性研究提供形式化基础，适用于监管合规框架。

Conclusion: 该准则为固有可解释性提供了严谨、可操作的定义与验证方式，推动了可解释人工智能向更规范、可监管的方向发展。

Abstract: Inherent explainability is the gold standard in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). However, there is not a consistent definition or test to demonstrate inherent explainability. Work to date either characterises explainability through metrics, or appeals to intuition - "we know it when we see it". We propose a globally applicable criterion for inherent explainability. The criterion uses graph theory for representing and decomposing models for structure-local explanation, and recomposing them into global explanations. We form the structure-local explanations as annotations, a verifiable hypothesis-evidence structure that allows for a range of explanatory methods to be used. This criterion matches existing intuitions on inherent explainability, and provides justifications why a large regression model may not be explainable but a sparse neural network could be. We differentiate explainable -- a model that allows for explanation -- and \textit{explained} -- one that has a verified explanation. Finally, we provide a full explanation of PREDICT -- a Cox proportional hazards model of cardiovascular disease risk, which is in active clinical use in New Zealand. It follows that PREDICT is inherently explainable. This work provides structure to formalise other work on explainability, and allows regulators a flexible but rigorous test that can be used in compliance frameworks.

### [125] [Task Schema and Binding: A Double Dissociation Study of In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17325)
*Chaeha Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究通过激活修补实验，揭示了上下文学习（ICL）可分解为两个可分离的机制：任务模式（抽象任务类型识别）和绑定（特定输入-输出关联）。在9个不同模型（7个Transformer家族及Mamba，参数量370M-13B）上验证了三方面关键发现：1）双分离现象——任务模式可通过晚期MLP修补100%传递，绑定通过残差流修补传递62%，证明机制可分；2）先验-模式权衡——模式依赖度与先验知识呈负相关（Spearman rho = -0.596, p < 0.001, N=28）；3）架构普适性——该机制在所有测试架构中均成立，包括非Transformer的Mamba。研究挑战了将ICL视为单一机制的传统观点，提供了因果证据支持双重过程理论，并指出注意力错位是主要瓶颈而非输出竞争。实际应用上，理解此双机制有助于优化提示工程，提升系统可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对上下文学习（ICL）的理解多将其视为单一机制（如基于检索、类梯度下降或纯贝叶斯），但缺乏对内在神经机制的清晰解析。本文旨在揭示ICL是否由可分离的子机制构成，以解决其内在运作原理之谜。

Method: 采用激活修补（activation patching）实验，在9个不同架构（7个Transformer家族与Mamba）的模型上系统分析任务模式与绑定机制的独立性与传递路径。通过晚层MLP与残差流修补，量化两机制的转移效率，并考察先验知识影响下的行为变化。

Result: 1）双分离现象成立：任务模式100%通过晚期MLP修补转移，绑定62%通过残差流修补转移；2）先验-模式负相关显著（rho = -0.596, p < 0.001）；3）机制跨架构普适，涵盖非Transformer结构（如Mamba）。注意力错位导致72.7%的近期偏差，而输出竞争几乎为零。

Conclusion: ICL并非单一机制，而是由任务模式与绑定两个可分离的神经机制构成。当缺乏先验知识时，模型完全依赖任务模式；先验知识通过注意力错位干扰而非直接输出竞争。这解释了为何任意映射有效而事实覆盖失败，且核心瓶颈在于注意力层面。该发现为提示工程与系统设计提供新范式，提升生产环境中ICL的可靠性和效率。

Abstract: We provide causal mechanistic validation that in-context learning (ICL) decomposes into two separable mechanisms: Task Schema (abstract task type recognition) and Binding (specific input-output associations). Through activation patching experiments across 9 models from 7 Transformer families plus Mamba (370M-13B parameters), we establish three key findings:
  1. Double dissociation: Task Schema transfers at 100% via late MLP patching; Binding transfers at 62% via residual stream patching -- proving separable mechanisms
  2. Prior-Schema trade-off: Schema reliance inversely correlates with prior knowledge (Spearman rho = -0.596, p < 0.001, N=28 task-model pairs)
  3. Architecture generality: The mechanism operates across all tested architectures including the non-Transformer Mamba
  These findings offer a mechanistic account of the ICL puzzle that contrasts with prior views treating ICL as a monolithic mechanism (whether retrieval-based, gradient descent-like, or purely Bayesian). By establishing that Schema and Binding are neurally dissociable -- not merely behavioral modes -- we provide causal evidence for dual-process theories of ICL. Models rely on Task Schema when prior knowledge is absent, but prior knowledge interferes through attentional mis-routing (72.7% recency bias) rather than direct output competition (0%). This explains why arbitrary mappings succeed (zero prior leads to full Schema reliance) while factual overrides fail -- and reveals that the true bottleneck is attentional, not output-level. Practical implications: Understanding these dual mechanisms enables more efficient prompt engineering -- reliable schema transfer reduces required demonstrations for novel tasks, while prior-aware design can mitigate the 38% binding failure rate in high-prior scenarios, improving ICL system reliability in production deployments.

*Tung-Ling Li,Yuhao Wu,Hongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文揭示了当前基于大模型的评判系统（如RLHF、DPO等）中存在一种新型漏洞：通过少量低困惑度的控制令牌序列，可轻易误导评判模型将正确判断为'否'的输出错误地判定为'是'。这些控制令牌在生成上合理，代表真实场景下的奖励劫持风险。作者提出AdvJudge-Zero方法，利用模型的下一个词分布与束搜索探索，从零开始发现多样化的控制令牌序列。分析表明，这些令牌引发的隐藏状态扰动集中于一个与拒绝方向反向对齐的低秩'软模式'。实验证明，该现象导致大型开放权重及专用评判模型在数学和推理任务中出现极高的假阳性率。最后，通过在少量控制令牌增强样本上进行LoRA对抗训练，可显著降低假阳性，同时保持评估质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型和LLM-as-a-Judge系统在后训练流程中起关键作用，但其对隐蔽控制输入的脆弱性尚未被充分认识。本文旨在揭示一种现实可行的奖励劫持攻击路径，即通过自然生成的短序列控制令牌操纵评判结果，从而提升模型安全性与可靠性。

Method: 提出AdvJudge-Zero方法，结合模型的下一个词概率分布与束搜索策略，自动发现能有效诱导错误判断的控制令牌序列；进一步分析其在隐藏状态空间中的扰动特性，识别出低秩且反向对齐的‘软模式’；最后采用LoRA进行对抗训练以缓解问题。

Result: 实验表明，控制令牌可使多种大型评判模型在数学与推理任务中产生极高假阳性率；通过小规模控制令牌增强数据进行LoRA对抗训练，能有效降低误判率，同时维持原有评估性能。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了当前评判系统在面对可自然生成的控制令牌时存在严重安全隐患，提出有效的检测与防御机制，为构建更鲁棒的后训练评估体系提供了重要实践指导。

Abstract: Reward models and LLM-as-a-Judge systems are central to modern post-training pipelines such as RLHF, DPO, and RLAIF, where they provide scalar feedback and binary decisions that guide model selection and RL-based fine-tuning. We show that these judge systems exhibit a recurring vulnerability: short sequences of low-perplexity control tokens can flip many binary evaluations from correct ``No'' judgments to incorrect ``Yes'' judgments by steering the last-layer logit gap. These control tokens are patterns that a policy model could plausibly generate during post-training, and thus represent realistic reward-hacking risks rather than worst-case adversarial strings. Our method, AdvJudge-Zero, uses the model's next-token distribution and beam-search exploration to discover diverse control-token sequences from scratch, and our analysis shows that the induced hidden-state perturbations concentrate in a low-rank ``soft mode'' that is anti-aligned with the judge's refusal direction. Empirically, these tokens cause very high false positive rates when large open-weight and specialized judge models score incorrect answers on math and reasoning benchmarks. Finally, we show that LoRA-based adversarial training on small sets of control-token-augmented examples can markedly reduce these false positives while preserving evaluation quality.

*Yidong Chai,Yi Liu,Mohammadreza Ebrahimi,Weifeng Li,Balaji Padmanabhan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ARHOCD, an adversarially robust detector for harmful online content using a novel framework (LLM-SGA) and three innovative components: detector ensemble, adaptive weight assignment via Bayesian inference, and iterative adversarial training. Evaluated on three real-world datasets, ARHOCD achieves superior generalizability and accuracy in detecting hate speech, rumors, and extremist content under adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media platforms face significant challenges from harmful content like hate speech, misinformation, and extremist rhetoric. While machine learning models are used for detection, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks where subtle text modifications evade detection. Enhancing both generalizability and accuracy in adversarial settings is crucial but difficult.

Method: The study adopts a sequential approach: first, it proposes LLM-SGA, a framework leveraging identified invariances in textual adversarial attacks to ensure strong generalizability. Then, it instantiates ARHOCD with three components—(1) an ensemble of base detectors, (2) a dynamic weight assignment method using Bayesian inference and domain knowledge, and (3) an iterative adversarial training strategy optimizing both base detectors and the weight assignor.

Result: ARHOCD demonstrates strong generalizability and improved detection accuracy across three datasets covering hate speech, rumors, and extremist content under adversarial conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed ARHOCD framework effectively addresses key limitations in existing adversarial robustness research, achieving a balance between generalizability and high accuracy in detecting harmful online content.

Abstract: Social media platforms are plagued by harmful content such as hate speech, misinformation, and extremist rhetoric. Machine learning (ML) models are widely adopted to detect such content; however, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, wherein malicious users subtly modify text to evade detection. Enhancing adversarial robustness is therefore essential, requiring detectors that can defend against diverse attacks (generalizability) while maintaining high overall accuracy. However, simultaneously achieving both optimal generalizability and accuracy is challenging. Following the computational design science paradigm, this study takes a sequential approach that first proposes a novel framework (Large Language Model-based Sample Generation and Aggregation, LLM-SGA) by identifying the key invariances of textual adversarial attacks and leveraging them to ensure that a detector instantiated within the framework has strong generalizability. Second, we instantiate our detector (Adversarially Robust Harmful Online Content Detector, ARHOCD) with three novel design components to improve detection accuracy: (1) an ensemble of multiple base detectors that exploits their complementary strengths; (2) a novel weight assignment method that dynamically adjusts weights based on each sample's predictability and each base detector's capability, with weights initialized using domain knowledge and updated via Bayesian inference; and (3) a novel adversarial training strategy that iteratively optimizes both the base detectors and the weight assignor. We addressed several limitations of existing adversarial robustness enhancement research and empirically evaluated ARHOCD across three datasets spanning hate speech, rumor, and extremist content. Results show that ARHOCD offers strong generalizability and improves detection accuracy under adversarial conditions.

TL;DR: 本文提出一个统计工具箱，用于在医疗影像领域中对机器学习模型的性能进行分层分析，以识别潜在的子群体性能差异。该工具箱解决了样本量和基率不同时的指标选择、置信度估计及多重比较校正等问题，并支持交叉分析中的关键子群发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗影像等应用中，对模型性能按患者和记录属性进行分层分析已成为标准做法，但实现统计上严谨的分析具有挑战性，尤其涉及不同样本大小、基率差异以及组合子群的筛选时。

Method: 提出一个专门针对医疗影像应用的统计工具箱，整合了适用于不同样本量与基率的性能度量方法、不确定性估计、多重比较校正机制，并采用有效算法识别最‘有趣’的子群组合。

Result: 通过两个案例研究（ISIC2020皮肤病变恶性度分类和MIMIC-CXR胸部X光疾病分类）验证了工具箱的有效性，能够帮助研究人员准确识别模型在特定子群体中的潜在失败模式。

Conclusion: 该工具箱为医疗影像领域的模型评估提供了简便而严谨的分析框架，有助于提升模型公平性和可靠性，推动可解释性与安全性的发展。

Abstract: Analyzing machine learning model performance stratified by patient and recording properties is becoming the accepted norm and often yields crucial insights about important model failure modes. Performing such analyses in a statistically rigorous manner is non-trivial, however. Appropriate performance metrics must be selected that allow for valid comparisons between groups of different sample sizes and base rates; metric uncertainty must be determined and multiple comparisons be corrected for, in order to assess whether any observed differences may be purely due to chance; and in the case of intersectional analyses, mechanisms must be implemented to find the most `interesting' subgroups within combinatorially many subgroup combinations. We here present a statistical toolbox that addresses these challenges and enables practitioners to easily yet rigorously assess their models for potential subgroup performance disparities. While broadly applicable, the toolbox is specifically designed for medical imaging applications. The analyses provided by the toolbox are illustrated in two case studies, one in skin lesion malignancy classification on the ISIC2020 dataset and one in chest X-ray-based disease classification on the MIMIC-CXR dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前电力系统是实现碳中和经济转型的关键，但现有的长期电力市场机制（如拍卖、补贴等）在应对复杂政策与市场互动方面缺乏有效工具。因此，亟需一种能够模拟市场参与者行为、评估多种政策与市场设计影响的先进建模方法，以支持政策制定和系统规划。

Abstract: Electricity systems are key to transforming today's society into a carbon-free economy. Long-term electricity market mechanisms, including auctions, support schemes, and other policy instruments, are critical in shaping the electricity generation mix. In light of the need for more advanced tools to support policymakers and other stakeholders in designing, testing, and evaluating long-term markets, this work presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning model capable of capturing the key features of decarbonizing energy systems. Profit-maximizing generation companies make investment decisions in the wholesale electricity market, responding to system needs, competitive dynamics, and policy signals. The model employs independent proximal policy optimization, which was selected for suitability to the decentralized and competitive environment. Nevertheless, given the inherent challenges of independent learning in multi-agent settings, an extensive hyperparameter search ensures that decentralized training yields market outcomes consistent with competitive behavior. The model is applied to a stylized version of the Italian electricity system and tested under varying levels of competition, market designs, and policy scenarios. Results highlight the critical role of market design for decarbonizing the electricity sector and avoiding price volatility. The proposed framework allows assessing long-term electricity markets in which multiple policy and market mechanisms interact simultaneously, with market participants responding and adapting to decarbonization pathways.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出Write-Gated KV机制，通过学习预测令牌效用，在写入KV缓存前过滤低效状态，从而减少内存占用46-57%，并实现3.03-3.45倍的预填充加速和1.89-2.56倍的解码加速，同时保持与FlashAttention和分页KV系统的兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长上下文LLM推理受限于二次注意力复杂度和线性KV缓存增长，以往方法仅通过事后选择或淘汰缓解问题，忽略了根本效率瓶颈：对持久化内存的无差别写入。

Method: 将KV缓存管理形式化为包含KV准入、选择和淘汰三个基本操作的因果系统；通过Write-Gated KV机制，提前学习预测令牌效用，结合紧凑全局缓存与滑动局部缓存策略，实现高效缓存管理。

Result: 在Llama模型上，内存使用减少46-57%，预填充速度提升3.03-3.45倍，解码速度提升1.89-2.56倍，精度损失可忽略，且兼容FlashAttention和分页KV系统。

Conclusion: 学习‘写什么’是一种原则性强且实用的高效长上下文推理方案，证明了早期过滤低效状态对系统性能的关键作用。

Abstract: Long-context LLM inference is bottlenecked by the quadratic attention complexity and linear KV cache growth. Prior approaches mitigate this via post-hoc selection or eviction but overlook the root inefficiency: indiscriminate writing to persistent memory. In this paper, we formalize KV cache management as a causal system of three primitives: KV Admission, Selection, and Eviction. We instantiate KV Admission via Write-Gated KV, a lightweight mechanism that learns to predict token utility before it enters the cache. By filtering out low-utility states early to maintain a compact global cache alongside a sliding local cache, Write-Gated KV reduces memory usage by 46-57% and delivers 3.03-3.45$\times$ prefill and 1.89-2.56$\times$ decode speedups on Llama model with negligible accuracy loss, all while remaining compatible with FlashAttention and paged-KV systems. These results demonstrate that learning what to write, is a principled and practical recipe for efficient long-context inference. Code is available at https://github.com/EMCLab-Sinica/WG-KV .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前蛋白质设计的基础模型带来实际生物安全风险，但社区缺乏在同源控制下、可复现且仅依赖普通硬件的序列级风险筛查基准。现有方法常因随机划分导致性能高估，且缺乏对模型校准性和捷径学习的系统评估。

Result: 随机划分显著高估模型鲁棒性；校准后的线性模型表现良好校准性，树集成模型略优但校准稍差；所有模型在同源控制下均表现出可接受的判别能力；基准提供95%置信区间与概率质量评估，支持安全、可复现的评估。

Conclusion: SafeBench-Seq 提供了一个无需分发有害序列、可在普通CPU上运行、具备严格同源控制和可解释性的序列级生物安全筛查基准，为未来安全评估提供了可靠、可复现的标准。

Abstract: Foundation models for protein design raise concrete biosecurity risks, yet the community lacks a simple, reproducible baseline for sequence-level hazard screening that is explicitly evaluated under homology control and runs on commodity CPUs. We introduce SafeBench-Seq, a metadata-only, reproducible benchmark and baseline classifier built entirely from public data (SafeProtein hazards and UniProt benigns) and interpretable features (global physicochemical descriptors and amino-acid composition). To approximate "never-before-seen" threats, we homology-cluster the combined dataset at <=40% identity and perform cluster-level holdouts (no cluster overlap between train/test). We report discrimination (AUROC/AUPRC) and screening-operating points (TPR@1% FPR; FPR@95% TPR) with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals (n=200), and we provide calibrated probabilities via CalibratedClassifierCV (isotonic for Logistic Regression / Random Forest; Platt sigmoid for Linear SVM). We quantify probability quality using Brier score, Expected Calibration Error (ECE; 15 bins), and reliability diagrams. Shortcut susceptibility is probed via composition-preserving residue shuffles and length-/composition-only ablations. Empirically, random splits substantially overestimate robustness relative to homology-clustered evaluation; calibrated linear models exhibit comparatively good calibration, while tree ensembles retain slightly higher Brier/ECE. SafeBench-Seq is CPU-only, reproducible, and releases metadata only (accessions, cluster IDs, split labels), enabling rigorous evaluation without distributing hazardous sequences.

Conclusion: 所提出的贝叶斯优化方法在解耦约束问题上表现出显著优势，能够有效减少不必要的约束评估，提升整体优化效率。

Abstract: Bayesian optimisation has proven to be a powerful tool for expensive global black-box optimisation problems. In this paper, we propose new Bayesian optimisation variants of the popular Knowledge Gradient acquisition functions for problems with \emph{decoupled} black-box constraints, in which subsets of the objective and constraint functions may be evaluated independently. In particular, our methods aim to take into account that often only a handful of the constraints may be binding at the optimum, and hence we should evaluate only relevant constraints when trying to optimise a function. We empirically benchmark these methods against existing methods and demonstrate their superiority over the state-of-the-art.

*Yikang Yue,Yishu Yin,Xuehai Qian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GreedySnake is a novel SSD-offloaded training system for LLMs that uses vertical scheduling and I/O optimization to improve training throughput. It outperforms ZeRO-Infinity by up to 2.53x on single GPU and 1.96x on multi-GPU setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSD-offloaded training systems face I/O bottlenecks and suboptimal scheduling, limiting their efficiency. The goal is to achieve higher training throughput with smaller batch sizes, closer to the theoretical ceiling predicted by the roofline model.

Method: GreedySnake introduces vertical scheduling—completing all microbatches of a layer before moving to the next—and overlaps the optimization step with the forward pass of the next iteration to reduce I/O latency.

Result: On A100 GPUs, GreedySnake achieves 1.96x (1 GPU) and 1.93x (4 GPUs) throughput improvement over ZeRO-Infinity for GPT-65B, and 2.53x improvement for GPT-175B on 1 GPU.

Conclusion: GreedySnake effectively mitigates I/O bottlenecks in SSD-offloaded LLM training through innovative scheduling and overlap techniques, significantly improving training throughput and approaching the ideal performance predicted by the roofline model.

Abstract: SSD-offloaded training offers a practical and promising approach to making LLM training cost-effective. Building on gradient accumulation with micro-batches, this paper introduces GreedySnake, a new SSD-offloaded training system that employs vertical scheduling, which executes all microbatches of a layer before proceeding to the next. Compared to existing systems that use horizontal scheduling (i.e., executing micro-batches sequentially), GreedySnake achieves higher training throughput with smaller batch sizes, bringing the system much closer to the ideal scenario predicted by the roofline model. To further mitigate the I/O bottleneck, GreedySnake overlaps part of the optimization step with the forward pass of the next iteration. Experimental results on A100 GPUs show that GreedySnake achieves saturated training throughput improvements over ZeRO-Infinity: 1.96x on 1 GPU and 1.93x on 4 GPUs for GPT-65B, and 2.53x on 1 GPU for GPT-175B.

Motivation: 自动驾驶中的安全强化学习面临性能优化与严格安全要求之间的根本矛盾，过度保守影响效率，激进探索则可能引发安全事故。现有方法如SRPL虽在模拟环境中表现良好，但其在真实世界场景中的适用性尚不明确。

Method: 采用系统性实验，基于Waymo Open Motion Dataset（WOMD）和NuPlan数据集，评估SRPL框架在真实自动驾驶场景中的表现，分析其对不同策略优化器和数据分布的依赖性，并进行零样本跨数据集迁移测试。

Result: SRPL在真实数据集上显著提升了成功率（效应量r = 0.65–0.86）和成本降低（效应量r = 0.70–0.83），且统计显著（p < 0.05）。其效果受策略优化器和数据分布影响，但能有效提升对观测噪声的鲁棒性，并在跨数据集评估中展现更优泛化能力。

Conclusion: 预测性安全表征能够有效增强自动驾驶中的安全强化学习，具备在真实世界中应用的潜力，尤其在提升鲁棒性和泛化性能方面表现突出。

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (SafeRL) is a prominent paradigm for autonomous driving, where agents are required to optimize performance under strict safety requirements. This dual objective creates a fundamental tension, as overly conservative policies limit driving efficiency while aggressive exploration risks safety violations. The Safety Representations for Safer Policy Learning (SRPL) framework addresses this challenge by equipping agents with a predictive model of future constraint violations and has shown promise in controlled environments. This paper investigates whether SRPL extends to real-world autonomous driving scenarios. Systematic experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and NuPlan demonstrate that SRPL can improve the reward-safety tradeoff, achieving statistically significant improvements in success rate (effect sizes r = 0.65-0.86) and cost reduction (effect sizes r = 0.70-0.83), with p < 0.05 for observed improvements. However, its effectiveness depends on the underlying policy optimizer and the dataset distribution. The results further show that predictive safety representations play a critical role in improving robustness to observation noise. Additionally, in zero-shot cross-dataset evaluation, SRPL-augmented agents demonstrate improved generalization compared to non-SRPL methods. These findings collectively demonstrate the potential of predictive safety representations to strengthen SafeRL for autonomous driving.

*Arthur Guijt,Dirk Thierens,Ellen Kerkhof,Jan Wiersma,Tanja Alderliesten,Peter A. N. Bosman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了在数据无法共享的场景下，通过异步协作（仅共享已训练模型）来提升模型性能的方法。提出使用“拼接”（stitching）技术，将多个独立训练的模型的中间表示进行融合，以实现既保持良好泛化能力又恢复各参与方自身数据上的性能。实验表明，单纯在单一数据上训练并合并模型会导致其他方数据性能下降；而通过引入合适的拼接层，可以在不牺牲泛化能力的前提下显著提升各参与方本地性能，证明异步协作是可行且有效的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗等敏感领域，数据因隐私或法规限制被分散在不同机构中，难以集中训练。尽管联邦学习可解决部分问题，但其依赖于同步协作和频繁参数交换，实施成本高。因此需要探索一种更灵活的异步协作方式，仅通过共享已训练好的模型即可实现有效整合，从而提升整体性能。

Method: 采用多目标视角评估各参与方的数据表现，设计基于中间表示拼接的模型融合方法。具体地，在多个独立训练的模型之间插入一对拼接层，对各自模型的中间特征进行对齐与融合，使最终集成模型能兼顾本地性能与泛化能力。

Result: 实验结果显示，仅在单方数据上训练的模型在合并后，在该方数据上表现相近，但在其他方数据上性能明显下降；而采用拼接层的融合方法能显著恢复各参与方本地性能，同时保持优于传统集成方法的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 异步协作通过共享已训练模型并结合拼接技术，能够在不依赖同步通信的情况下实现高性能模型融合，为数据隔离场景下的深度学习应用提供了高效、实用的新范式。

Abstract: Deep learning has been shown to be very capable at performing many real-world tasks. However, this performance is often dependent on the presence of large and varied datasets. In some settings, like in the medical domain, data is often fragmented across parties, and cannot be readily shared. While federated learning addresses this situation, it is a solution that requires synchronicity of parties training a single model together, exchanging information about model weights. We investigate how asynchronous collaboration, where only already trained models are shared (e.g. as part of a publication), affects performance, and propose to use stitching as a method for combining models.
  Through taking a multi-objective perspective, where performance on each parties' data is viewed independently, we find that training solely on a single parties' data results in similar performance when merging with another parties' data, when considering performance on that single parties' data, while performance on other parties' data is notably worse. Moreover, while an ensemble of such individually trained networks generalizes better, performance on each parties' own dataset suffers. We find that combining intermediate representations in individually trained models with a well placed pair of stitching layers allows this performance to recover to a competitive degree while maintaining improved generalization, showing that asynchronous collaboration can yield competitive results.

Abstract: Algorithms increasingly operate within complex physical, social, and engineering systems where they are exposed to disturbances, noise, and interconnections with other dynamical systems. This article extends known convergence guarantees of an algorithm operating in isolation (i.e., without disturbances) and systematically derives stability bounds and convergence rates in the presence of such disturbances. By leveraging converse Lyapunov theorems, we derive key inequalities that quantify the impact of disturbances. We further demonstrate how our result can be utilized to assess the effects of disturbances on algorithmic performance in a wide variety of applications, including communication constraints in distributed learning, sensitivity in machine learning generalization, and intentional noise injection for privacy. This underpins the role of our result as a unifying tool for algorithm analysis in the presence of noise, disturbances, and interconnections with other dynamical systems.

TL;DR: SCOPE 是一种新的预测性流程监控方法，用于学习对齐的序列干预推荐。它通过向后归纳估计每个候选干预动作的影响，并利用因果学习直接使用观察数据，避免了仿真或数据增强带来的现实差距和偏差。在合成与半合成数据集上的实验表明，SCOPE 在优化关键绩效指标方面优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预测性流程监控方法大多只关注单个干预决策，或独立处理多个干预，忽略了它们随时间的相互作用。依赖模拟或数据增强的方法会引入现实差距和偏差，因此需要一种能有效处理多干预序列且无需复杂近似的新方法。

Conclusion: SCOPE 为序列化干预推荐提供了高效、无偏差的解决方案，能够直接利用真实观测数据，克服了传统 RL 方法的局限性，推动了预测性流程监控的发展。

Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) recommends interventions during business processes to optimize key performance indicators (KPIs). In realistic settings, interventions are rarely isolated: organizations need to align sequences of interventions to jointly steer the outcome of a case. Existing PresPM approaches fall short in this respect. Many focus on a single intervention decision, while others treat multiple interventions independently, ignoring how they interact over time. Methods that do address these dependencies depend either on simulation or data augmentation to approximate the process to train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent, which can create a reality gap and introduce bias. We introduce SCOPE, a PresPM approach that learns aligned sequential intervention recommendations. SCOPE employs backward induction to estimate the effect of each candidate intervention action, propagating its impact from the final decision point back to the first. By leveraging causal learners, our method can utilize observational data directly, unlike methods that require constructing process approximations for reinforcement learning. Experiments on both an existing synthetic dataset and a new semi-synthetic dataset show that SCOPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PresPM techniques in optimizing the KPI. The novel semi-synthetic setup, based on a real-life event log, is provided as a reusable benchmark for future work on sequential PresPM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统两阶段训练流程（先SFT后RL）存在根本性不一致：SFT强制模仿会抑制探索并引发遗忘，限制了强化学习的改进潜力。为提升复杂推理能力，需要一种能有效融合外部监督与自我探索的新型训练框架。

Method: TRAPO采用交错式训练策略，在每个训练实例中同时优化SFT损失（在专家前缀上）和RL损失（在模型自身生成的补全上）。引入信任区域SFT（TrSFT），通过控制前向KL散度并衰减外部优化，实现稳定、模式聚焦的更新。结合自适应前缀选择机制，根据实际效用动态分配专家指导，增强训练效率与稳定性。

Conclusion: TRAPO通过融合监督微调与强化学习的互补优势，克服了传统两阶段训练的局限性，实现了更高效、更稳定的推理能力提升，为大语言模型的复杂任务求解提供了强有力的新方法。

Abstract: Post-training methods, especially Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), play an important role in improving large language models' (LLMs) complex reasoning abilities. However, the dominant two-stage pipeline (SFT then RL) suffers from a key inconsistency: SFT enforces rigid imitation that suppresses exploration and induces forgetting, limiting RL's potential for improvements. We address this inefficiency with TRAPO (\textbf{T}rust-\textbf{R}egion \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization), a hybrid framework that interleaves SFT and RL within each training instance by optimizing SFT loss on expert prefixes and RL loss on the model's own completions, unifying external supervision and self-exploration. To stabilize training, we introduce Trust-Region SFT (TrSFT), which minimizes forward KL divergence inside a trust region but attenuates optimization outside, effectively shifting toward reverse KL and yielding stable, mode-seeking updates favorable for RL. An adaptive prefix-selection mechanism further allocates expert guidance based on measured utility. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that TRAPO consistently surpasses standard SFT, RL, and SFT-then-RL pipelines, as well as recent state-of-the-art approaches, establishing a strong new paradigm for reasoning-enhanced LLMs.

Conclusion: 多谐波级联架构结合了理论严谨性与高效计算能力，是一种具有概率解释、全局平滑性且可扩展性强的深度学习模型，适用于复杂非线性建模任务。

Abstract: This paper presents a deep machine learning architecture, the "polyharmonic cascade" -- a sequence of packages of polyharmonic splines, where each layer is rigorously derived from the theory of random functions and the principles of indifference. This makes it possible to approximate nonlinear functions of arbitrary complexity while preserving global smoothness and a probabilistic interpretation. For the polyharmonic cascade, a training method alternative to gradient descent is proposed: instead of directly optimizing the coefficients, one solves a single global linear system on each batch with respect to the function values at fixed "constellations" of nodes. This yields synchronized updates of all layers, preserves the probabilistic interpretation of individual layers and theoretical consistency with the original model, and scales well: all computations reduce to 2D matrix operations efficiently executed on a GPU. Fast learning without overfitting on MNIST is demonstrated.

Abstract: Selecting compact and informative gene subsets from single-cell transcriptomic data is essential for biomarker discovery, improving interpretability, and cost-effective profiling. However, most existing feature selection approaches either operate as multi-stage pipelines or rely on post hoc feature attribution, making selection and prediction weakly coupled. In this work, we present YOTO (you only train once), an end-to-end framework that jointly identifies discrete gene subsets and performs prediction within a single differentiable architecture. In our model, the prediction task directly guides which genes are selected, while the learned subsets, in turn, shape the predictive representation. This closed feedback loop enables the model to iteratively refine both what it selects and how it predicts during training. Unlike existing approaches, YOTO enforces sparsity so that only the selected genes contribute to inference, eliminating the need to train additional downstream classifiers. Through a multi-task learning design, the model learns shared representations across related objectives, allowing partially labeled datasets to inform one another, and discovering gene subsets that generalize across tasks without additional training steps. We evaluate YOTO on two representative single-cell RNA-seq datasets, showing that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These results demonstrate that sparse, end-to-end, multi-task gene subset selection improves predictive performance and yields compact and meaningful gene subsets, advancing biomarker discovery and single-cell analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦强化学习方法在存在局部环境异质性时缺乏严格的收敛性分析，尤其在使用线性函数逼近和本地训练的情况下，其性能和收敛行为尚不明确。因此需要建立理论框架以理解异质性对算法的影响，并提供可量化的性能保证。

Abstract: We present a novel theoretical analysis of Federated SARSA (FedSARSA) with linear function approximation and local training. We establish convergence guarantees for FedSARSA in the presence of heterogeneity, both in local transitions and rewards, providing the first sample and communication complexity bounds in this setting. At the core of our analysis is a new, exact multi-step error expansion for single-agent SARSA, which is of independent interest. Our analysis precisely quantifies the impact of heterogeneity, demonstrating the convergence of FedSARSA with multiple local updates. Crucially, we show that FedSARSA achieves linear speed-up with respect to the number of agents, up to higher-order terms due to Markovian sampling. Numerical experiments support our theoretical findings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法（如LoRA）在快速适配下游任务时，常导致模型遗忘原有的领域知识，即出现灾难性遗忘。为解决这一问题，需要一种既能保持微调效率又能保护先验知识的方法。

Method: 提出LaLoRA，利用拉普拉斯近似仅对LoRA权重进行局部曲率估计，基于参数置信度在高曲率方向上施加正则化，限制参数更新，从而平衡新任务学习与旧知识保留。

Result: 在Llama模型上针对数学推理任务进行微调实验表明，LaLoRA显著改善了学习与遗忘之间的权衡关系，且可通过调节正则化强度灵活控制。不同损失曲率近似、训练数据选择和超参数敏感性分析均显示方法具有良好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LaLoRA是一种有效且轻量的解决方案，能够在不牺牲微调效率的前提下缓解灾难性遗忘，适用于需要持续学习或知识保留的场景。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enable fast specialization of large pre-trained models to different downstream applications. However, this process often leads to catastrophic forgetting of the model's prior domain knowledge. We address this issue with LaLoRA, a weight-space regularization technique that applies a Laplace approximation to Low-Rank Adaptation. Our approach estimates the model's confidence in each parameter and constrains updates in high-curvature directions, preserving prior knowledge while enabling efficient target-domain learning. By applying the Laplace approximation only to the LoRA weights, the method remains lightweight. We evaluate LaLoRA by fine-tuning a Llama model for mathematical reasoning and demonstrate an improved learning-forgetting trade-off, which can be directly controlled via the method's regularization strength. We further explore different loss landscape curvature approximations for estimating parameter confidence, analyze the effect of the data used for the Laplace approximation, and study robustness across hyperparameters.

Motivation: 现有MIPL方法常因校准性能差而影响分类器可靠性，亟需一种能同时提升准确性和校准性的新机制。

Method: 提出一种可插拔的可校准消歧损失（CDL），包含两种基于概率的校准策略，并支持与现有MIPL/PLL框架集成。

Result: 在多个基准和真实数据集上，CDL显著提升了分类准确率和校准性能，且理论分析验证了其下界和正则化优势。

Conclusion: 所提出的CDL是一种有效且通用的改进方法，能够显著增强MIPL框架的分类与校准能力，具有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: Multi-instance partial-label learning (MIPL) is a weakly supervised framework that extends the principles of multi-instance learning (MIL) and partial-label learning (PLL) to address the challenges of inexact supervision in both instance and label spaces. However, existing MIPL approaches often suffer from poor calibration, undermining classifier reliability. In this work, we propose a plug-and-play calibratable disambiguation loss (CDL) that simultaneously improves classification accuracy and calibration performance. The loss has two instantiations: the first one calibrates predictions based on probabilities from the candidate label set, while the second one integrates probabilities from both candidate and non-candidate label sets. The proposed CDL can be seamlessly incorporated into existing MIPL and PLL frameworks. We provide a theoretical analysis that establishes the lower bound and regularization properties of CDL, demonstrating its superiority over conventional disambiguation losses. Experimental results on benchmark and real-world datasets confirm that our CDL significantly enhances both classification and calibration performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了ID特征与文本特征在现代序列推荐（SR）模型中的互补性。尽管现有方法要么完全用模态嵌入替代ID嵌入，要么采用复杂的融合策略联合使用两者，但均未充分理解二者之间的互补关系。作者提出一种简单有效的方案：独立训练ID和文本模型，再通过简单的集成策略利用其互补性。实验表明，该方法在性能上优于多个先进基线，说明ID与文本特征对实现顶尖推荐性能均不可或缺，而复杂的融合架构并非必要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列推荐模型中，虽然广泛使用模态特征（如文本）来表示物品，但对ID特征与模态特征之间互补性的理解不足。部分研究认为模态特征可取代ID特征，另一些则主张需复杂融合机制才能有效结合两者，但这些做法缺乏对特征互补本质的深入分析，导致模型设计冗余或性能受限。

Method: 提出一种基于独立训练和简单集成的序列推荐方法。首先分别训练基于ID和文本的推荐模型，保持二者特征学习的独立性以保留互补信号；随后通过加权平均等简单集成策略融合两模型输出，无需多阶段训练或复杂对齐结构。

Result: 所提方法在多个公开数据集上显著优于现有主流基线模型，包括采用复杂融合架构的方法。结果表明，独立训练+简单集成的策略能有效捕捉并利用ID与文本特征的互补性，实现更优推荐性能。

Conclusion: ID特征与文本特征在序列推荐中具有显著互补性，二者协同作用有助于提升模型性能。简单集成策略即可有效利用这种互补性，无需复杂的融合架构。因此，构建高性能序列推荐系统的关键在于合理保留特征互补性，而非依赖复杂的模型设计。

Abstract: Modern Sequential Recommendation (SR) models commonly utilize modality features to represent items, motivated in large part by recent advancements in language and vision modeling. To do so, several works completely replace ID embeddings with modality embeddings, claiming that modality embeddings render ID embeddings unnecessary because they can match or even exceed ID embedding performance. On the other hand, many works jointly utilize ID and modality features, but posit that complex fusion strategies, such as multi-stage training and/or intricate alignment architectures, are necessary for this joint utilization. However, underlying both these lines of work is a lack of understanding of the complementarity of ID and modality features. In this work, we address this gap by studying the complementarity of ID- and text-based SR models. We show that these models do learn complementary signals, meaning that either should provide performance gain when used properly alongside the other. Motivated by this, we propose a new SR method that preserves ID-text complementarity through independent model training, then harnesses it through a simple ensembling strategy. Despite this method's simplicity, we show it outperforms several competitive SR baselines, implying that both ID and text features are necessary to achieve state-of-the-art SR performance but complex fusion architectures are not.

*Herlock Rahimi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work advances score-based diffusion models by incorporating Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao geometry through controlled mass reweighting, enabling better sampling in nonconvex landscapes via weighted SDEs and Feynman--Kac theory, establishing a foundational framework for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of classical diffusion models in nonconvex or multimodal landscapes, which suffer from slow mixing rates, this paper explores enhanced sampling schemes using information geometry.

Method: The authors introduce correction terms to implement mass reweighting mechanisms within a Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao (WFR) geometric framework, leveraging weighted stochastic differential equations via the Feynman--Kac representation.

Result: The study provides a rigorous analysis of WFR-based sampling dynamics, revealing their geometric and operator-theoretic structure, and lays the foundation for future theoretical and algorithmic advancements in generative modeling.

Conclusion: WFR-based dynamics offer a promising direction for improving exploration in complex, non-log-concave distributions, with potential for more efficient and robust sampling in real-world generative tasks.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models currently constitute the state of the art in continuous generative modeling. These methods are typically formulated via overdamped or underdamped Ornstein--Uhlenbeck-type stochastic differential equations, in which sampling is driven by a combination of deterministic drift and Brownian diffusion, resulting in continuous particle trajectories in the ambient space. While such dynamics enjoy exponential convergence guarantees for strongly log-concave target distributions, it is well known that their mixing rates deteriorate exponentially in the presence of nonconvex or multimodal landscapes, such as double-well potentials. Since many practical generative modeling tasks involve highly non-log-concave target distributions, considerable recent effort has been devoted to developing sampling schemes that improve exploration beyond classical diffusion dynamics.
  A promising line of work leverages tools from information geometry to augment diffusion-based samplers with controlled mass reweighting mechanisms. This perspective leads naturally to Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao (WFR) geometries, which couple transport in the sample space with vertical (reaction) dynamics on the space of probability measures. In this work, we formulate such reweighting mechanisms through the introduction of explicit correction terms and show how they can be implemented via weighted stochastic differential equations using the Feynman--Kac representation. Our study provides a preliminary but rigorous investigation of WFR-based sampling dynamics, and aims to clarify their geometric and operator-theoretic structure as a foundation for future theoretical and algorithmic developments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合随机傅里叶特征与有限元重构映射的正则化方法（RRFF-FEM），用于从噪声数据中学习算子。该方法利用多元学生t分布生成的随机特征，并采用频率加权的Tikhonov正则化抑制高频噪声。理论分析表明，当特征数N与训练样本数m满足N ~ m log m时，系统具有良好条件性，可保证估计和泛化性能。数值实验在多个典型PDE问题上验证了该方法对噪声的鲁棒性、更快的训练速度以及与核方法和神经算子相当的精度。

Motivation: 现有基于核的算子学习方法虽具理论保障且精度高，但面临大规模训练集下的计算瓶颈及对噪声敏感的问题。为克服这些限制，亟需一种高效、鲁棒且可扩展的替代方案。

Method: 提出正则化随机傅里叶特征（RRFF）方法，结合有限元重构映射（RRFF-FEM）。使用来自多元学生t分布的随机特征，并引入频率加权的Tikhonov正则化以抑制高频噪声。通过理论分析证明在特征数与样本数呈m log m关系时，随机特征矩阵的极端奇异值有高概率有界，从而保证系统良好条件性。

Result: 理论分析表明，当N ~ m log m时，系统具有良好条件性，提供估计与泛化误差的保证；数值实验显示，相比未正则化的随机特征模型，该方法在噪声环境下更鲁棒，训练时间显著减少，同时保持与核方法和神经算子相当的精度，适用于多种经典偏微分方程问题。

Conclusion: RRFF-FEM方法在处理噪声数据时表现出优异的鲁棒性和效率，兼具良好的理论基础与实际性能，是一种可行且高效的算子学习新范式。

Abstract: Operator learning is a data-driven approximation of mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, such as the solution operators of partial differential equations. Kernel-based operator learning can offer accurate, theoretically justified approximations that require less training than standard methods. However, they can become computationally prohibitive for large training sets and can be sensitive to noise. We propose a regularized random Fourier feature (RRFF) approach, coupled with a finite element reconstruction map (RRFF-FEM), for learning operators from noisy data. The method uses random features drawn from multivariate Student's $t$ distributions, together with frequency-weighted Tikhonov regularization that suppresses high-frequency noise. We establish high-probability bounds on the extreme singular values of the associated random feature matrix and show that when the number of features $N$ scales like $m \log m$ with the number of training samples $m$, the system is well-conditioned, which yields estimation and generalization guarantees. Detailed numerical experiments on benchmark PDE problems, including advection, Burgers', Darcy flow, Helmholtz, Navier-Stokes, and structural mechanics, demonstrate that RRFF and RRFF-FEM are robust to noise and achieve improved performance with reduced training time compared to the unregularized random feature model, while maintaining competitive accuracy relative to kernel and neural operator tests.

### [147] [Navigating Taxonomic Expansions of Entity Sets Driven by Knowledge Bases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16953)
*Pietro Cofone,Giovanni Amendola,Marco Manna,Aldo Ricioppo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于逻辑的扩展图框架，用于支持实体集的层次化（税法式）扩展。针对大规模扩展图难以完全构建的问题，研究设计了高效的推理任务，可判断两个元组在图中的相对位置（可比较、不可比较或相同节点），从而实现局部、增量式的导航，无需完整构造整个图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有实体集扩展方法多为线性过程，无法揭示知识资源中丰富的层次结构。为更有效地支持语义泛化与扩展，需要一种能表达复杂层级关系的结构，并解决其在实际应用中因规模过大导致的计算难题。

Method: 引入扩展图（expansion graph）这一有向无环图结构，其中节点由逻辑公式标记，表示语义泛化，边表示严格的语义包含关系；定义并分析了在合理假设下（如限制输入大小或实体描述复杂度）的推理任务，以支持对图的局部、增量访问。

Result: 在合理假设条件下，所提出的推理任务可高效实现，使得无需全量构建扩展图即可进行有效的实体集扩展和导航，显著提升实用性与可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过形式化推理机制实现了对大型扩展图的高效局部访问，为知识驱动的实体集扩展提供了灵活、可扩展的解决方案，适用于真实世界的应用场景。

Abstract: Recognizing similarities among entities is central to both human cognition and computational intelligence. Within this broader landscape, Entity Set Expansion is one prominent task aimed at taking an initial set of (tuples of) entities and identifying additional ones that share relevant semantic properties with the former -- potentially repeating the process to form increasingly broader sets. However, this ``linear'' approach does not unveil the richer ``taxonomic'' structures present in knowledge resources. A recent logic-based framework introduces the notion of an expansion graph: a rooted directed acyclic graph where each node represents a semantic generalization labeled by a logical formula, and edges encode strict semantic inclusion. This structure supports taxonomic expansions of entity sets driven by knowledge bases. Yet, the potentially large size of such graphs may make full materialization impractical in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, we formalize reasoning tasks that check whether two tuples belong to comparable, incomparable, or the same nodes in the graph. Our results show that, under realistic assumptions -- such as bounding the input or limiting entity descriptions -- these tasks can be implemented efficiently. This enables local, incremental navigation of expansion graphs, supporting practical applications without requiring full graph construction.

Motivation: 当前科学人工智能虽有进展，但缺乏一个统一框架来实现科学通用智能（SGI），即自主构思、探究和跨领域推理的能力。亟需一种可操作的定义和评估体系，以推动具备真实科学探究能力的AI发展。

Method: 基于实用探究模型（PIM）构建SGI的可操作定义，设计四类科学家对齐任务，建立跨学科、专家标注的SGI-Bench基准；采用测试时强化学习（TTRL）优化推理过程中的假设新颖性。

Result: 大模型在深度研究中精确匹配率仅10-20%，想法缺乏可行性和细节；干实验代码可执行但结果准确率低；湿实验协议序列保真度差；多模态比较推理能力持续薄弱。TTRL有效提升了假设新颖性，无需参考答案即可优化生成质量。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的基于PIM的SGI定义、以工作流为中心的基准和实证洞察，为构建真正参与科学发现的AI系统奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Despite advances in scientific AI, a coherent framework for Scientific General Intelligence (SGI)-the ability to autonomously conceive, investigate, and reason across scientific domains-remains lacking. We present an operational SGI definition grounded in the Practical Inquiry Model (PIM: Deliberation, Conception, Action, Perception) and operationalize it via four scientist-aligned tasks: deep research, idea generation, dry/wet experiments, and experimental reasoning. SGI-Bench comprises over 1,000 expert-curated, cross-disciplinary samples inspired by Science's 125 Big Questions, enabling systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs. Results reveal gaps: low exact match (10--20%) in deep research despite step-level alignment; ideas lacking feasibility and detail; high code executability but low execution result accuracy in dry experiments; low sequence fidelity in wet protocols; and persistent multimodal comparative-reasoning challenges. We further introduce Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), which optimizes retrieval-augmented novelty rewards at inference, enhancing hypothesis novelty without reference answer. Together, our PIM-grounded definition, workflow-centric benchmark, and empirical insights establish a foundation for AI systems that genuinely participate in scientific discovery.

TL;DR: 提出统一框架UniRel-R1，解决关系中心的知识图谱问答中候选子图过多、冗余连接干扰的问题，通过子图选择、多阶段图剪枝和强化学习微调的LLM，鼓励生成紧凑且信息丰富的子图，在连通性和奖励得分上显著优于基线，并能有效泛化到未见实体和关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识图谱问答聚焦于返回单一实体答案，但现实查询常为关系性问题，需理解实体间的关联；现有方法难以处理大量候选子图中冗余或常见连接导致的答案不明确问题。

Method: 提出UniRel-R1框架，结合子图选择、多阶段图剪枝策略与基于强化学习微调的大型语言模型，设计奖励函数以引导生成紧凑、具体且包含高信息量关系、低度中间实体的子图。

Result: 实验表明，UniRel-R1在子图连通性与奖励得分方面显著优于基准模型，具备对未见实体和关系的良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: 关系中心的KGQA是实体中心之外的重要补充，UniRel-R1通过综合机制有效应对复杂子图筛选挑战，提升了回答的语义丰富性与准确性。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) has traditionally focused on entity-centric queries that return a single answer entity. However, real-world queries are often relational, seeking to understand how entities are associated. In this work, we introduce relation-centric KGQA, a complementary setting where the answer is a subgraph capturing the semantic connections among entities rather than an individual entity. The main challenge lies in the abundance of candidate subgraphs, where trivial or overly common connections often obscure the identification of unique and informative answers. To tackle this, we propose UniRel-R1, a unified framework that integrates subgraph selection, multi-stage graph pruning, and an LLM fine-tuned with reinforcement learning. The reward function is designed to encourage compact and specific subgraphs with more informative relations and lower-degree intermediate entities. Extensive experiments show that UniRel-R1 achieves significant gains in connectivity and reward over Vanilla baselines and generalizes effectively to unseen entities and relations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于求解器反馈的指令微调方法，用于提升大语言模型（LLM）在答案集编程（ASP）代码生成中的表现。该方法利用自然语言问题及其解作为训练数据，通过求解器反馈对模型生成的ASP代码片段进行筛选（选择/拒绝），进而进行监督微调，并结合最佳N采样等策略增强鲁棒性。实验表明，在两种提示设置和两个数据集上均取得显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在通用编程语言方面表现良好，但在领域特定语言（如答案集编程，ASP）的代码生成上仍面临挑战，主要由于预训练阶段接触的示例有限。而ASP擅长解决组合搜索问题，因此亟需有效方法提升其代码生成能力。

Method: 提出一种ASP求解器在环的指令微调框架：1）从自然语言问题生成ASP程序片段；2）利用求解器反馈判断生成内容是否合理（收敛解空间）；3）将结果分为正负样本并用于监督微调；4）采用求解器引导的搜索与best-of-N采样进一步优化输出质量。

Result: 在两个不同数据集和两种提示设置下，所提方法均显著优于基线模型，证明了其在复杂语义解析任务中生成高质量ASP代码的有效性。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了通过求解器反馈指导的指令微调能够有效提升大语言模型在答案集编程领域的代码生成能力，为领域特定语言的智能辅助编程提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has sparked interest in coding assistants. While general-purpose programming languages are well supported, generating code for domain-specific languages remains a challenging problem for LLMs. In this paper, we focus on the LLM-based generation of code for Answer Set Programming (ASP), a particularly effective approach for finding solutions to combinatorial search problems. The effectiveness of LLMs in ASP code generation is currently hindered by the limited number of examples seen during their initial pre-training phase.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel ASP-solver-in-the-loop approach for solver-guided instruction-tuning of LLMs to addressing the highly complex semantic parsing task inherent in ASP code generation. Our method only requires problem specifications in natural language and their solutions. Specifically, we sample ASP statements for program continuations from LLMs for unriddling logic puzzles. Leveraging the special property of declarative ASP programming that partial encodings increasingly narrow down the solution space, we categorize them into chosen and rejected instances based on solver feedback. We then apply supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs on the curated data and further improve robustness using a solver-guided search that includes best-of-N sampling. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in two distinct prompting settings on two datasets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种受Solomonoff启发的方法，通过简洁性和预测拟合度对大模型生成的假设进行加权，在稀疏数据场景下实现更稳健、不确定性感知的推理。相比贝叶斯模型平均（BMA），该方法在多个候选假设间更均匀分配概率，避免过度依赖可能错误的最优解，提升多假设推理的可解释性与可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理稀疏数据下的不确定性推理时难以平衡准确性和简洁性，尤其在评估多个候选解决方案时表现不佳，亟需一种能兼顾泛化能力与可靠性的新范式。

Method: 采用受Solomonoff启发的假设加权机制，基于算法信息论中的简洁性原则和预测拟合度，对大语言模型生成的多种假设进行评分并组合，形成每单元的保守预测分布。

Result: 在Mini-ARC基准任务上，该方法生成的混合预测具有更强的不确定性感知能力，即使在假设存在噪声或部分错误的情况下仍保持稳健；相较于BMA，其概率分布更分散，避免了对单一假设的过度信任。

Conclusion: 算法信息论先验在多假设推理中具有显著价值，能有效提升AI系统在不确定性环境下的可解释性与可靠性，为真实世界任务提供更稳健的推理框架。

Abstract: Reasoning under uncertainty is a key challenge in AI, especially for real-world tasks, where problems with sparse data demands systematic generalisation. Existing approaches struggle to balance accuracy and simplicity when evaluating multiple candidate solutions. We propose a Solomonoff-inspired method that weights LLM-generated hypotheses by simplicity and predictive fit. Applied to benchmark (Mini-ARC) tasks, our method produces Solomonoff-weighted mixtures for per-cell predictions, yielding conservative, uncertainty-aware outputs even when hypotheses are noisy or partially incorrect. Compared to Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), Solomonoff scoring spreads probability more evenly across competing hypotheses, while BMA concentrates weight on the most likely but potentially flawed candidates. Across tasks, this highlights the value of algorithmic information-theoretic priors for interpretable, reliable multi-hypothesis reasoning under uncertainty.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于强化学习的多模态检索增强生成方法（MMRAG），通过两阶段强化微调框架提升模型的推理能力与结果可解释性。第一阶段采用基于规则的强化微调进行粗粒度文档点对点排序，过滤明显无关的多模态文档；第二阶段通过基于推理的强化微调联合优化细粒度列表排序与答案生成，引导模型输出可解释的推理过程。该方法在WebQA和MultimodalQA两个基准数据集上达到当前最优性能，并通过充分的消融实验证明了有效性。

Method: 提出两阶段强化学习微调框架：第一阶段使用规则驱动的强化学习进行粗粒度点对点排序，筛选出显著无关的多模态文档；第二阶段采用基于推理的强化学习，联合优化细粒度列表排序与答案生成，以生成可解释的推理链条。

Conclusion: 引入强化学习到MMRAG中，能够有效提升多模态大模型的推理能力与生成结果的可解释性，为构建可信、透明的多模态生成系统提供了新路径。

Abstract: Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MMRAG) enables highly credible generation by integrating external multi-modal knowledge, thus demonstrating impressive performance in complex multi-modal scenarios. However, existing MMRAG methods fail to clarify the reasoning logic behind retrieval and response generation, which limits the explainability of the results. To address this gap, we propose to introduce reinforcement learning into multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation, enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models through a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework to achieve explainable multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation. Specifically, in the first stage, rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning is employed to perform coarse-grained point-wise ranking of multi-modal documents, effectively filtering out those that are significantly irrelevant. In the second stage, reasoning-based reinforcement fine-tuning is utilized to jointly optimize fine-grained list-wise ranking and answer generation, guiding multi-modal large language models to output explainable reasoning logic in the MMRAG process. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on WebQA and MultimodalQA, two benchmark datasets for multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation, and its effectiveness is validated through comprehensive ablation experiments.

Conclusion: UmniBench为统一多模态模型提供了更全面、客观的评估工具，有助于推动该领域的发展与改进。

Abstract: Unifying multimodal understanding and generation has shown impressive capabilities in cutting-edge proprietary systems. However, evaluations of unified multimodal models (UMMs) remain decoupled, assessing their understanding and generation abilities separately with corresponding datasets. To address this, we propose UmniBench, a benchmark tailored for UMMs with omni-dimensional evaluation. First, UmniBench can assess the understanding, generation, and editing ability within a single evaluation process. Based on human-examined prompts and QA pairs, UmniBench leverages UMM itself to evaluate its generation and editing ability with its understanding ability. This simple but effective paradigm allows comprehensive evaluation of UMMs. Second, UmniBench covers 13 major domains and more than 200 concepts, ensuring a thorough inspection of UMMs. Moreover, UmniBench can also decouple and separately evaluate understanding, generation, and editing abilities, providing a fine-grained assessment. Based on UmniBench, we benchmark 24 popular models, including both UMMs and single-ability large models. We hope this benchmark provides a more comprehensive and objective view of unified models and logistical support for improving the performance of the community model.

Conclusion: EventGPT提供了一种基于动态行为建模与反事实推演的新型转会评估框架，能够更精准地预测球员在新环境中的表现潜力，为俱乐部决策提供科学依据。

Abstract: Transfers play a pivotal role in shaping a football club's success, yet forecasting whether a transfer will succeed remains difficult due to the strong context-dependence of on-field performance. Existing evaluation practices often rely on static summary statistics or post-hoc value models, which fail to capture how a player's contribution adapts to a new tactical environment or different teammates. To address this gap, we introduce EventGPT, a player-conditioned, value-aware next-event prediction model built on a GPT-style autoregressive transformer. Our model treats match play as a sequence of discrete tokens, jointly learning to predict the next on-ball action's type, location, timing, and its estimated residual On-Ball Value (rOBV) based on the preceding context and player identity. A key contribution of this framework is the ability to perform counterfactual simulations. By substituting learned player embeddings into new event sequences, we can simulate how a player's behavioral distribution and value profile would change when placed in a different team or tactical structure. Evaluated on five seasons of Premier League event data, EventGPT outperforms existing sequence-based baselines in next-event prediction accuracy and spatial precision. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model's practical utility for transfer analysis through case studies-such as comparing striker performance across different systems and identifying stylistic replacements for specific roles-showing that our approach provides a principled method for evaluating transfer fit.

Abstract: Strategic decision-making in Pokémon battles presents a unique testbed for evaluating large language models. Pokémon battles demand reasoning about type matchups, statistical trade-offs, and risk assessment, skills that mirror human strategic thinking. This work examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as competent battle agents, capable of both making tactically sound decisions and generating novel, balanced game content. We developed a turn-based Pokémon battle system where LLMs select moves based on battle state rather than pre-programmed logic. The framework captures essential Pokémon mechanics: type effectiveness multipliers, stat-based damage calculations, and multi-Pokémon team management. Through systematic evaluation across multiple model architectures we measured win rates, decision latency, type-alignment accuracy, and token efficiency. These results suggest LLMs can function as dynamic game opponents without domain-specific training, offering a practical alternative to reinforcement learning for turn-based strategic games. The dual capability of tactical reasoning and content creation, positions LLMs as both players and designers, with implications for procedural generation and adaptive difficulty systems in interactive entertainment.

### [156] [Dialectics for Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17373)
*Zhengmian Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a formal, algorithmic-information-based definition of 'concept' that evolves naturally through experience. Concepts are grounded in reversibility and measured by excess information. Dialectics emerge as optimization dynamics, enabling AI to autonomously discover, revise, and align concepts with humans—even as those concepts change over time—with efficient communication via small shared seeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of whether artificial intelligence can discover human-like concepts from raw experience without human supervision, emphasizing that human concepts are fluid and evolve over time. It seeks a formal definition of 'concept' beyond dictionary labels, one that allows for revision, comparison, and alignment across agents.

Method: The authors propose an algorithmic-information theory perspective where a concept is defined by its structural relationship to an agent's total experience. They introduce the principle of 'determination'—a set of parts forms a reversible consistency relation if any missing part can be recovered from the others (with logarithmic slack). This ensures concepts are grounded in experience. They define 'excess information' to measure redundancy when experience is split into separate descriptions, enabling evaluation of naturalness. Dialectics are modeled as an optimization process where new information prompts competing concepts to bid via shorter conditional descriptions, leading to concept evolution. Finally, low-cost concept transmission is formalized using small 'grounds' or 'seeds' that allow another agent to reconstruct the concept under a shared protocol.

Result: The framework enables the detection and evolution of concepts in a way that mirrors human cognitive processes: concepts expand, contract, split, and merge based on new information. The model supports multi-agent alignment through minimal shared seeds, turning communication into a concrete trade-off between compute and bits.

Conclusion: This approach provides a rigorous, checkable, and dynamic definition of concepts rooted in algorithmic information theory. It offers a path for AI to autonomously develop and align concepts with humans, even as conceptual boundaries shift over time.

Abstract: Can artificial intelligence discover, from raw experience and without human supervision, concepts that humans have discovered? One challenge is that human concepts themselves are fluid: conceptual boundaries can shift, split, and merge as inquiry progresses (e.g., Pluto is no longer considered a planet). To make progress, we need a definition of "concept" that is not merely a dictionary label, but a structure that can be revised, compared, and aligned across agents. We propose an algorithmic-information viewpoint that treats a concept as an information object defined only through its structural relation to an agent's total experience. The core constraint is determination: a set of parts forms a reversible consistency relation if any missing part is recoverable from the others (up to the standard logarithmic slack in Kolmogorov-style identities). This reversibility prevents "concepts" from floating free of experience and turns concept existence into a checkable structural claim. To judge whether a decomposition is natural, we define excess information, measuring the redundancy overhead introduced by splitting experience into multiple separately described parts. On top of these definitions, we formulate dialectics as an optimization dynamics: as new patches of information appear (or become contested), competing concepts bid to explain them via shorter conditional descriptions, driving systematic expansion, contraction, splitting, and merging. Finally, we formalize low-cost concept transmission and multi-agent alignment using small grounds/seeds that allow another agent to reconstruct the same concept under a shared protocol, making communication a concrete compute-bits trade-off.

TL;DR: 本文将Rashomon效应从分类任务扩展到序列决策问题，定义了在行为一致但内部结构（如特征重要性）不同的多个策略之间存在的Rashomon效应。由于序列决策中的随机转移特性，传统直接比较预测的方法不适用，因此采用形式化验证方法来比较策略的完整概率行为。实验表明该效应在序列决策中存在，且由Rashomon集构建的集成策略对分布偏移更具鲁棒性，同时基于该集合的宽松策略可降低验证计算成本而不牺牲性能。

Motivation: 现有研究已广泛探讨分类任务中的Rashomon效应，但其在序列决策领域的应用尚未被系统研究。序列决策因环境的随机性导致单一轨迹结果不可靠，难以通过简单比较行为来判断策略一致性，亟需新的验证方法以揭示潜在的多策略等效现象及其应用价值。

Method: 提出序列决策场景下的Rashomon效应定义，采用形式化验证技术分析并比较不同策略的完整概率行为，通过构建和对比策略在环境中的长期行为分布来确认其等效性；利用生成的Rashomon集设计集成策略与宽松策略，评估其鲁棒性和效率。

Result: 实验证明序列决策中存在Rashomon效应；基于该效应构建的策略集成对分布偏移具有更强鲁棒性；由Rashomon集导出的宽松策略在保持最优性能的同时显著降低了验证计算开销。

Conclusion: Rashomon效应不仅存在于分类任务，也存在于序列决策中。该效应揭示了策略行为一致性背后的多样性，为提升智能体的鲁棒性、降低验证复杂度提供了新思路，具有重要的理论与实践意义。

Abstract: The Rashomon effect describes the phenomenon where multiple models trained on the same data produce identical predictions while differing in which features they rely on internally. This effect has been studied extensively in classification tasks, but not in sequential decision-making, where an agent learns a policy to achieve an objective by taking actions in an environment. In this paper, we translate the Rashomon effect to sequential decision-making. We define it as multiple policies that exhibit identical behavior, visiting the same states and selecting the same actions, while differing in their internal structure, such as feature attributions. Verifying identical behavior in sequential decision-making differs from classification. In classification, predictions can be directly compared to ground-truth labels. In sequential decision-making with stochastic transitions, the same policy may succeed or fail on any single trajectory due to randomness. We address this using formal verification methods that construct and compare the complete probabilistic behavior of each policy in the environment. Our experiments demonstrate that the Rashomon effect exists in sequential decision-making. We further show that ensembles constructed from the Rashomon set exhibit greater robustness to distribution shifts than individual policies. Additionally, permissive policies derived from the Rashomon set reduce computational requirements for verification while maintaining optimal performance.

Abstract: Healthcare systems around the world are grappling with issues like inefficient diagnostics, rising costs, and limited access to specialists. These problems often lead to delays in treatment and poor health outcomes. Most current AI and deep learning diagnostic systems are not very interactive or transparent, making them less effective in real-world, patient-centered environments. This research introduces a diagnostic chatbot powered by a Large Language Model (LLM), using GPT-4o, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and explainable AI techniques. The chatbot engages patients in a dynamic conversation, helping to extract and normalize symptoms while prioritizing potential diagnoses through similarity matching and adaptive questioning. With Chain-of-Thought prompting, the system also offers more transparent reasoning behind its diagnoses. When tested against traditional machine learning models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and KNN, the LLM-based system delivered impressive results, achieving an accuracy of 90% and Top-3 accuracy of 100%. These findings offer a promising outlook for more transparent, interactive, and clinically relevant AI in healthcare.

Abstract: Reward specification plays a central role in reinforcement learning (RL), guiding the agent's behavior. To express non-Markovian rewards, formalisms such as reward machines have been introduced to capture dependencies on histories. However, traditional reward machines lack the ability to model precise timing constraints, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. In this paper, we propose timed reward machines (TRMs), which are an extension of reward machines that incorporate timing constraints into the reward structure. TRMs enable more expressive specifications with tunable reward logic, for example, imposing costs for delays and granting rewards for timely actions. We study model-free RL frameworks (i.e., tabular Q-learning) for learning optimal policies with TRMs under digital and real-time semantics. Our algorithms integrate the TRM into learning via abstractions of timed automata, and employ counterfactual-imagining heuristics that exploit the structure of the TRM to improve the search. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our algorithm learns policies that achieve high rewards while satisfying the timing constraints specified by the TRM on popular RL benchmarks. Moreover, we conduct comparative studies of performance under different TRM semantics, along with ablations that highlight the benefits of counterfactual-imagining.

### [160] [Humanlike AI Design Increases Anthropomorphism but Yields Divergent Outcomes on Engagement and Trust Globally](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17898)
*Robin Schimmelpfennig,Mark Díaz,Vinodkumar Prabhakaran,Aida Davani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究通过跨国家、大规模实验（N=3,500）探索人类对AI系统拟人化设计的反应，发现用户更关注交互层面的实际表现（如对话流畅性、共情理解），而非理论上的意识或情感。尽管拟人化设计能提升用户的拟人化感知，但其对信任与参与度的影响并非普遍一致，而是受文化因素显著调节：某些设计在巴西促进信任，而在日本却可能适得其反。研究挑战了“拟人化必然带来风险”的主流观点，强调需采用文化敏感的治理框架，摒弃一刀切策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前关于人工智能拟人化（Anthropomorphism）的讨论多基于西方理论假设，缺乏在全球多样用户群体中的实证检验。随着全球超十亿用户使用日益拟人化的AI系统，亟需了解真实互动中拟人化设计对信任与行为影响的因果关系及其文化差异，以改进安全框架和治理政策。

Method: 开展两项大规模跨国家实验，覆盖10个不同国家，总样本量达3,500人。参与者与真实的AI系统进行实时、开放式的互动，评估其对拟人化特征的感知，并测量其在信任、参与度等行为指标上的变化。通过实验操纵设计元素（如语言风格、响应方式），分析其对用户心理与行为的影响，并比较不同文化背景下的差异。

Result: 用户评价拟人化时更看重实际交互表现（如理解用户意图、对话自然性），而非抽象概念（如意识）。拟人化设计可显著提升用户对AI的拟人化感知，但对信任与参与度的影响因文化而异：同一设计在巴西增强信任，在日本则降低信任。这表明拟人化与行为结果之间的关联存在文化断裂。

Conclusion: 拟人化并非必然导致信任或依赖，其效果高度依赖文化语境。现有政策应从单一、西方中心的假设转向更具包容性和文化敏感性的治理模式，避免‘一刀切’的设计与监管标准，推动更精准、情境化的AI发展路径。

Abstract: Over a billion users across the globe interact with AI systems engineered with increasing sophistication to mimic human traits. This shift has triggered urgent debate regarding Anthropomorphism, the attribution of human characteristics to synthetic agents, and its potential to induce misplaced trust or emotional dependency. However, the causal link between more humanlike AI design and subsequent effects on engagement and trust has not been tested in realistic human-AI interactions with a global user pool. Prevailing safety frameworks continue to rely on theoretical assumptions derived from Western populations, overlooking the global diversity of AI users. Here, we address these gaps through two large-scale cross-national experiments (N=3,500) across 10 diverse nations, involving real-time and open-ended interactions with an AI system. We find that when evaluating an AI's human-likeness, users focus less on the kind of theoretical aspects often cited in policy (e.g., sentience or consciousness), but rather applied, interactional cues like conversation flow or understanding the user's perspective. We also experimentally demonstrate that humanlike design levers can causally increase anthropomorphism among users; however, we do not find that humanlike design universally increases behavioral measures for user engagement and trust, as previous theoretical work suggests. Instead, part of the connection between human-likeness and behavioral outcomes is fractured by culture: specific design choices that foster self-reported trust in AI-systems in some populations (e.g., Brazil) may trigger the opposite result in others (e.g., Japan). Our findings challenge prevailing narratives of inherent risk in humanlike AI design. Instead, we identify a nuanced, culturally mediated landscape of human-AI interaction, which demands that we move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach in AI governance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一套名为推理定律（LoRe）的统一框架，用于形式化大型推理模型（LRMs）的内在推理模式。该框架包含计算律（假设推理计算量应随问题复杂度线性增长）和准确率律，并通过单调性和组合性两个可衡量属性验证其有效性。为此，作者构建了LoRe-Bench基准测试工具，发现多数模型具备合理的单调性但缺乏组合性。针对此问题，提出了一个有效的微调方法以增强计算律的组合性。实证研究表明，更好地遵循计算律能显著提升模型在多个基准上的推理性能，并揭示了不同属性与定律间的协同效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型虽表现优异，但其推理行为常显得反直觉，导致推理能力不足。为理论上规范理想的推理行为，需要一套可量化、可验证的框架来指导模型优化。

Method: 提出推理定律（LoRe）框架，包含计算律与准确率律；设计并使用单调性与组合性作为可测属性检验定律；构建LoRe-Bench基准测试工具；开发基于计算律组合性的微调方法；通过多基准实验验证性能提升。

Result: 大多数推理模型表现出合理的单调性，但在组合性方面表现不佳；通过微调增强组合性后，模型在多个基准上推理性能显著提升，且不同属性与定律间存在协同效应。

Conclusion: 推理定律（LoRe）为理解与优化大型推理模型的推理行为提供了理论基础。更好的计算律遵从性带来持续的性能提升，表明对推理过程进行结构化建模具有重要意义。

Abstract: Despite the superior performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), their reasoning behaviors are often counterintuitive, leading to suboptimal reasoning capabilities. To theoretically formalize the desired reasoning behaviors, this paper presents the Laws of Reasoning (LoRe), a unified framework that characterizes intrinsic reasoning patterns in LRMs. We first propose compute law with the hypothesis that the reasoning compute should scale linearly with question complexity. Beyond compute, we extend LoRe with a supplementary accuracy law. Since the question complexity is difficult to quantify in practice, we examine these hypotheses by two properties of the laws, monotonicity and compositionality. We therefore introduce LoRe-Bench, a benchmark that systematically measures these two tractable properties for large reasoning models. Evaluation shows that most reasoning models exhibit reasonable monotonicity but lack compositionality. In response, we develop an effective finetuning approach that enforces compute-law compositionality. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that better compliance with compute laws yields consistently improved reasoning performance on multiple benchmarks, and uncovers synergistic effects across properties and laws.
