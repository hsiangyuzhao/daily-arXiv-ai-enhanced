However, their advantages under complex constraints remain nascent, for which current constraint-handling schemes via feasibility masking or implicit feasibility awareness can be inefficient or inapplicable for hard constraints. In this paper, we present Construct-and-Refine (CaR), the first general and efficient constraint-handling framework for neural routing solvers based on explicit learning-based feasibility refinement. Unlike prior construction-search hybrids that target reducing optimality gaps through heavy improvements yet still struggle with hard constraints, CaR achieves efficient constraint handling by designing a joint training framework that guides the construction module to generate diverse and high-quality solutions well-suited for a lightweight improvement process, e.g., 10 steps versus 5k steps in prior work. Moreover, CaR presents the first use of construction-improvement-shared representation, enabling potential knowledge sharing across paradigms by unifying the encoder, especially in more complex constrained scenarios. We evaluate CaR on typical hard routing constraints to showcase its broader applicability. Results demonstrate that CaR achieves superior feasibility, solution quality, and efficiency compared to both classical and neural state-of-the-art solvers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faConstruct-and-Refine\uff08CaR\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u663e\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7cbe\u70bc\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8def\u7531\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7ea6\u675f\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u5757\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u89e3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u598210\u6b65\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdb\u5171\u4eab\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0d\u540c\u8303\u5f0f\u95f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCaR\u5728\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3001\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u53ca\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u57fa\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u6216\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7ea6\u675f\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u5982\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u63a9\u7801\u6216\u9690\u5f0f\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faConstruct-and-Refine\uff08CaR\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5f15\u5bfc\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u5757\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u521d\u59cb\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6539\u8fdb\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdb\u5171\u4eab\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5178\u578b\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u8def\u7531\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0cCaR\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3001\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u4ee5\u53ca\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u8d85\u8d8a\u7ecf\u5178\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u57fa\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CaR\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u795e\u7ecf\u8def\u7531\u6c42\u89e3\u4e2d\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u6c42\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

A Benchmark of Uncertainty Metrics for LLM-Based Automatic Assessment", "comment": null, "summary": "The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) is reshaping the landscape of automatic assessment in education. While these systems demonstrate substantial advantages in adaptability to diverse question types and flexibility in output formats, they also introduce new challenges related to output uncertainty, stemming from the inherently probabilistic nature of LLMs. Output uncertainty is an inescapable challenge in automatic assessment, as assessment results often play a critical role in informing subsequent pedagogical actions, such as providing feedback to students or guiding instructional decisions. Unreliable or poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates can lead to unstable downstream interventions, potentially disrupting students' learning processes and resulting in unintended negative consequences. To systematically understand this challenge and inform future research, we benchmark a broad range of uncertainty quantification methods in the context of LLM-based automatic assessment. Although the effectiveness of these methods has been demonstrated in many tasks across other domains, their applicability and reliability in educational settings, particularly for automatic grading, remain underexplored. Through comprehensive analyses of uncertainty behaviors across multiple assessment datasets, LLM families, and generation control settings, we characterize the uncertainty patterns exhibited by LLMs in grading scenarios. Based on these findings, we evaluate the strengths and limitations of different uncertainty metrics and analyze the influence of key factors, including model families, assessment tasks, and decoding strategies, on uncertainty estimates. Our study provides actionable insights into the characteristics of uncertainty in LLM-based automatic assessment and lays the groundwork for developing more reliable and effective uncertainty-aware grading systems in the future.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u5177\u5907\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u867d\u5177\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u6559\u5b66\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5e72\u6270\u5b66\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001LLM\u5bb6\u65cf\u53ca\u751f\u6210\u63a7\u5236\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u8bc4\u5206\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u6807\u7684\u4f18\u52a3\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u5177\u5907\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

We introduce FlipSet, a diagnostic benchmark for Level-2 visual perspective taking (L2 VPT) in vision-language models. The task requires simulating 180-degree rotations of 2D character strings from another agent's perspective, isolating spatial transformation from 3D scene complexity. Evaluating 103 VLMs reveals systematic egocentric bias: the vast majority perform below chance, with roughly three-quarters of errors reproducing the camera viewpoint. Control experiments expose a compositional deficit--models achieve high theory-of-mind accuracy and above-chance mental rotation in isolation, yet fail catastrophically when integration is required. This dissociation indicates that current VLMs lack the mechanisms needed to bind social awareness to spatial operations, suggesting fundamental limitations in model-based spatial reasoning.

However, existing approaches often suffer from limited accuracy and poor generalization due to significant distribution shifts among samples generated by diverse forgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multivariate and Soft Blending Augmentation with CLIP-guided Forgery Intensity Estimation (MSBA-CLIP) framework. Our method leverages the multimodal alignment capabilities of CLIP to capture subtle forgery traces. We introduce a Multivariate and Soft Blending Augmentation (MSBA) strategy that synthesizes images by blending forgeries from multiple methods with random weights, forcing the model to learn generalizable patterns. Furthermore, a dedicated Multivariate Forgery Intensity Estimation (MFIE) module is designed to explicitly guide the model in learning features related to varied forgery modes and intensities. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. On in-domain tests, our method improves Accuracy and AUC by 3.32\\% and 4.02\\%, respectively, over the best baseline. In cross-domain evaluations across five datasets, it achieves an average AUC gain of 3.27\\%. Ablation studies confirm the efficacy of both proposed components.

The interaction of the surgical device with soft tissue is elevated to an augmented state space with a Koopman operator formulation, allowing linear prediction and control of the dynamics that are nonlinear by nature. To make the rendered forces consistent with human perceptual limits, we put forward a Bayesian calibration module based on WeberFechner and Stevens scaling laws, which progressively shape force signals relative to each individual's discrimination thresholds. For various simulated surgical tasks such as palpation, incision, and bone milling, the proposed system attains an average rendering latency of 4.3 ms, a force error of less than 2.8% and a 20% improvement in perceptual discrimination. Multivariate statistical analyses (MANOVA and regression) reveal that the system's performance is significantly better than that of conventional spring-damper and energy, based rendering methods.

In contrast, the current large language model training paradigm relies heavily on modeling vast, static corpora. While effective for knowledge acquisition, it overlooks the interactive feedback loops essential for models to adapt dynamically to their context. In this work, we propose a framework that treats this interactive in-context learning ability not as an emergent property, but as a distinct, trainable skill. We introduce a scalable method that transforms single-turn verifiable tasks into multi-turn didactic interactions driven by information asymmetry. We first show that current flagship models struggle to integrate corrective feedback on hard reasoning tasks. We then demonstrate that models trained with our approach dramatically improve the ability to interactively learn from language feedback. More specifically, the multi-turn performance of a smaller model nearly reaches that of a model an order of magnitude larger. We also observe robust out-of-distribution generalization: interactive training on math problems transfers to diverse domains like coding, puzzles and maze navigation. Our qualitative analysis suggests that this improvement is due to an enhanced in-context plasticity. Finally, we show that this paradigm offers a unified path to self-improvement. By training the model to predict the teacher's critiques, effectively modeling the feedback environment, we convert this external signal into an internal capability, allowing the model to self-correct even without a teacher.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u89c6\u4e3a\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6d8c\u73b0\u5c5e\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u6559\u5b66\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a5\u6536\u7ea0\u6b63\u53cd\u9988\u540e\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u6b64\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u6559\u5e08\u5373\u53ef\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4ea4\u4e92\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7ea0\u9519\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u4e3a\u5f25\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u9700\u8d4b\u4e88\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u52a8\u4ece\u8bed\u8a00\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5355\u8f6e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u591a\u8f6e\u6559\u5b66\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bad\u7ec3\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6559\u5e08\u6279\u8bc4\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u53cd\u9988\u73af\u5883\u5efa\u6a21\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u5316\u53cd\u9988\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u786c\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5341\u500d\u89c4\u6a21\u6c34\u5e73\uff1b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u7f16\u7a0b\u3001\u8c1c\u9898\u548c\u8ff7\u5bab\u5bfc\u822a\u7b49\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\uff1b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u5411\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fc8\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

Despite that, LLMs' ability to reason about GPS coordinates and real-world geography remains underexplored. We introduce GPSBench, a dataset of 57,800 samples across 17 tasks for evaluating geospatial reasoning in LLMs, spanning geometric coordinate operations (e.g., distance and bearing computation) and reasoning that integrates coordinates with world knowledge. Focusing on intrinsic model capabilities rather than tool use, we evaluate 14 state-of-the-art LLMs and find that GPS reasoning remains challenging, with substantial variation across tasks: models are generally more reliable at real-world geographic reasoning than at geometric computations. Geographic knowledge degrades hierarchically, with strong country-level performance but weak city-level localization, while robustness to coordinate noise suggests genuine coordinate understanding rather than memorization. We further show that GPS-coordinate augmentation can improve in downstream geospatial tasks, and that finetuning induces trade-offs between gains in geometric computation and degradation in world knowledge.

However, retrieved knowledge is often noisy, partially irrelevant, or misaligned with the visual content, while internal model knowledge is difficult to control and interpret. Naive aggregation of these sources limits reasoning effectiveness and reduces answer accuracy. To address this, we propose MaS-VQA, a selection-driven framework that tightly couples explicit knowledge filtering with implicit knowledge reasoning. MaS-VQA first retrieves candidate passages and applies a Mask-and-Select mechanism to jointly prune irrelevant image regions and weakly relevant knowledge fragments, producing compact, high-signal multimodal knowledge . This filtered knowledge then guides the activation of internal knowledge in a constrained semantic space, enabling complementary co-modeling of explicit and implicit knowledge for robust answer prediction. Experiments on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek demonstrate consistent performance gains across multiple MLLM backbones, and ablations verify that the selection mechanism effectively reduces noise and enhances knowledge utilization.", "AI": {"tldr": "MaS-VQA\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9009\u62e9\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4e0e\u9690\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9996\u5148\u68c0\u7d22\u5019\u9009\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u7801\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u8054\u5408\u5254\u9664\u65e0\u5173\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\u548c\u5f31\u76f8\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fe1\u53f7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5f15\u5bfc\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u5f0f\u4e0e\u9690\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u534f\u540c\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e2d\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u6216\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\u9519\u4f4d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u5185\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u96be\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u878d\u5408\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u679c\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMaS-VQA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7Mask-and-Select\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u5230\u7684\u5019\u9009\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u53bb\u9664\u65e0\u5173\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u9ad8\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b2\uff09\u5c06\u8fc7\u6ee4\u540e\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u5f0f\u4e0e\u9690\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u534f\u540c\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5728Encyclopedic-VQA\u548cInfoSeek\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMaS-VQA\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u77e5\u8bc6\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "MaS-VQA\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4e0e\u534f\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6e90\u77e5\u8bc6\u878d\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In practice, failures often arise as gradual divergence of internal reasoning dynamics rather than as isolated prediction errors. This work studies runtime stability in hybrid reasoning systems from a Kalman-inspired perspective. We model reasoning as a stochastic inference process driven by an internal innovation signal and introduce cognitive drift as a measurable runtime phenomenon. Stability is defined in terms of detectability, bounded divergence, and recoverability rather than task-level correctness. We propose a runtime stability framework that monitors innovation statistics, detects emerging instability, and triggers recovery-aware control mechanisms. Experiments on multi-step, tool-augmented reasoning tasks demonstrate reliable instability detection prior to task failure and show that recovery, when feasible, re-establishes bounded internal behavior within finite time. These results emphasize runtime stability as a system-level requirement for reliable reasoning under uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u7814\u7a76\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u4e0b\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7531\u5185\u90e8\u521b\u65b0\u4fe1\u53f7\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u968f\u673a\u63a8\u65ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u2018\u8ba4\u77e5\u6f02\u79fb\u2019\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u3001\u6709\u754c\u53d1\u6563\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u63a7\u521b\u65b0\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u72b6\u6001\u5e76\u89e6\u53d1\u6062\u590d\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u5931\u8d25\u524d\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u53ef\u884c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u6062\u590d\u81f3\u6709\u754c\u5185\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u53ef\u9760\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u51b3\u7b56\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u4e0b\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u884c\u4e3a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u89e3\uff1b\u5b9e\u9645\u6545\u969c\u591a\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u6027\u504f\u79bb\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5b64\u7acb\u9884\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u4fdd\u969c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u53d7\u5185\u90e8\u521b\u65b0\u4fe1\u53f7\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u968f\u673a\u63a8\u65ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8ba4\u77e5\u6f02\u79fb\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u521b\u65b0\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6062\u590d\u611f\u77e5\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u524d\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u6062\u590d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u5728\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u91cd\u65b0\u8fbe\u5230\u6709\u754c\u5185\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u53ef\u9760\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Remarkably, Machine Translation (MT) offers a much more nuanced take on this narrative: in MT, KD also functions as a general-purpose knowledge transfer mechanism that shapes supervision and translation quality as well as efficiency.\n  This survey synthesizes KD for MT (KD4MT) across 105 papers (through October 1, 2025). We begin by introducing both MT and KD for non-experts, followed by an overview of the standard KD approaches relevant to MT applications. Subsequently, we categorize advances in the KD4MT literature based on (i) their methodological contributions and (ii) their practical applications. Our qualitative and quantitative analyses identify common trends in the field and highlight key research gaps as well as the absence of unified evaluation practice for KD methods in MT. We further provide practical guidelines for selecting a KD method in concrete settings and highlight potential risks associated with the application of KD to MT such as increased hallucination and bias amplification. Finally, we discuss the role of LLMs in re-shaping the KD4MT field.

However, spatial reasoning on Earth imagery has lagged behind, as it uniquely involves grounding objects in georeferenced images and quantitatively reasoning about distances, directions, and topological relations using both visual cues and vector geometry coordinates (e.g., 2D bounding boxes, polylines, and polygons). Existing benchmarks for Earth imagery primarily focus on 2D spatial grounding, image captioning, and coarse spatial relations (e.g., simple directional or proximity cues). They lack support for quantitative direction and distance reasoning, systematic topological relations, and complex object geometries beyond bounding boxes. To fill this gap, we propose \\textbf{EarthSpatialBench}, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating spatial reasoning in MLLMs on Earth imagery. The benchmark contains over 325K question-answer pairs spanning: (1) qualitative and quantitative reasoning about spatial distance and direction; (2) systematic topological relations; (3) single-object queries, object-pair queries, and compositional aggregate group queries; and (4) object references expressed via textual descriptions, visual overlays, and explicit geometry coordinates, including 2D bounding boxes, polylines, and polygons. We conducted extensive experiments on both open-source and proprietary models to identify limitations in the spatial reasoning of MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faEarthSpatialBench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u5730\u7403\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u8d85\u8fc732.5\u4e07\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9a\u91cf\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u65b9\u5411\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u62d3\u6251\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5355\u5bf9\u8c61\u3001\u6210\u5bf9\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u7fa4\u4f53\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u53e0\u52a0\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5750\u6807\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u5bf9\u8c61\u5f15\u7528\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5730\u7403\u5f71\u50cf\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce82D\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u7c97\u7565\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5b9a\u91cf\u65b9\u5411\u4e0e\u8ddd\u79bb\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u62d3\u6251\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\uff08\u5982\u591a\u8fb9\u5f62\uff09\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u7b49\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaEarthSpatialBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u79cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a\u5305\u62ec\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0e\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u62d3\u6251\u5173\u7cfb\u5224\u65ad\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u67e5\u8be2\uff08\u5355\u4e2a\u3001\u6210\u5bf9\u3001\u7ec4\u5408\u7fa4\u4f53\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u5bf9\u8c61\u8868\u8fbe\u5f62\u5f0f\uff08\u6587\u672c\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u53e0\u52a0\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u5750\u6807\u5982\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u3001\u6298\u7ebf\u3001\u591a\u8fb9\u5f62\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5f00\u6e90\u4e0e\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u7cbe\u786e\u91cf\u5316\u5173\u7cfb\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "EarthSpatialBench\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5730\u7403\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u4e14\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5173\u952e\u77ed\u677f\u3002"}}

However, its benefits are not unidirectionally beneficial. There is no theoretical research or established estimation for the optimal sample size (OSS) in augmentation, nor is there an established metric to evaluate the accuracy of OSS or its deviation from the ground truth. To address these issues, we propose an information-theoretic optimal sample size estimation (IT-OSE) to provide reliable OSS estimation for industrial data augmentation. An interval coverage and deviation (ICD) score is proposed to evaluate the estimated OSS intuitively. The relationship between OSS and dominant factors is theoretically analyzed and formulated, thereby enhancing the interpretability. Experiments show that, compared to empirical estimation, the IT-OSE increases accuracy in classification tasks across baseline models by an average of 4.38%, and reduces MAPE in regression tasks across baseline models by an average of 18.80%. The improvements in downstream model performance are more stable. ICDdev in the ICD score is also reduced by an average of 49.30%. The determinism of OSS is enhanced. Compared to exhaustive search, the IT-OSE achieves the same OSS while reducing computational and data costs by an average of 83.97% and 93.46%.

Geometric Limitations of Steering in Large Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Personality steering in large language models (LLMs) commonly relies on injecting trait-specific steering vectors, implicitly assuming that personality traits can be controlled independently. In this work, we examine whether this assumption holds by analysing the geometric relationships between Big Five personality steering directions. We study steering vectors extracted from two model families (LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-8B) and apply a range of geometric conditioning schemes, from unconstrained directions to soft and hard orthonormalisation. Our results show that personality steering directions exhibit substantial geometric dependence: steering one trait consistently induces changes in others, even when linear overlap is explicitly removed. While hard orthonormalisation enforces geometric independence, it does not eliminate cross-trait behavioural effects and can reduce steering strength. These findings suggest that personality traits in LLMs occupy a slightly coupled subspace, limiting fully independent trait control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u683c\u8f6c\u5411\u5411\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u53bb\u9664\u7ebf\u6027\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u6539\u53d8\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u8d28\u4ecd\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u5176\u4ed6\u7279\u8d28\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u786c\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u53ef\u5f3a\u5236\u51e0\u4f55\u72ec\u7acb\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u6d88\u9664\u8de8\u7279\u8d28\u884c\u4e3a\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u524a\u5f31\u8f6c\u5411\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u5904\u4e8e\u8f7b\u5fae\u8026\u5408\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u5168\u72ec\u7acb\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u72ec\u7acb\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u68c0\u9a8c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6c\u5411\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u8c03\u8282\u65b9\u6cd5\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u662f\u5426\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\uff08LLaMA-3-8B \u548c Mistral-8B\uff09\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u4eba\u683c\u8f6c\u5411\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ece\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u5230\u8f6f\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u3001\u786c\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u4eba\u683c\u8f6c\u5411\u65b9\u5411\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff1b\u5373\u4f7f\u53bb\u9664\u7ebf\u6027\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u8c03\u6574\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u8d28\u4ecd\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u4ed6\u7279\u8d28\uff1b\u786c\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u867d\u80fd\u5f3a\u5236\u51e0\u4f55\u72ec\u7acb\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u80fd\u6d88\u9664\u8de8\u7279\u8d28\u884c\u4e3a\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u8f6c\u5411\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u5fae\u8026\u5408\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b8c\u5168\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u7279\u8d28\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Rather than proposing novel methods, we focus on several alternative approaches whose potential benefits are widely imaginable, yet have remained largely unexplored. The currently dominant paradigm, which can be termed \"extract then store,\" involves extracting information judged to be useful from experiences and saving only the extracted content. However, this approach inherently risks the loss of information, as some valuable knowledge particularly for different tasks may be discarded in the extraction process. In contrast, we emphasize the \"store then on-demand extract\" approach, which seeks to retain raw experiences and flexibly apply them to various tasks as needed, thus avoiding such information loss. In addition, we highlight two further approaches: discovering deeper insights from large collections of probabilistic experiences, and improving experience collection efficiency by sharing stored experiences. While these approaches seem intuitively effective, our simple experiments demonstrate that this is indeed the case. Finally, we discuss major challenges that have limited investigation into these promising directions and propose research topics to address them.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u8d85\u667a\u80fd\uff08ASI\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u201c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u201d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u4e3b\u6d41\u2018\u63d0\u53d6\u540e\u5b58\u50a8\u2019\u7684\u2018\u5b58\u50a8\u540e\u6309\u9700\u63d0\u53d6\u2019\u7406\u5ff5\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4ece\u6982\u7387\u6027\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u6df1\u5c42\u6d1e\u89c1\u3001\u5171\u4eab\u5b58\u50a8\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u7b49\u6f5c\u5728\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u7684\u2018\u63d0\u53d6\u540e\u5b58\u50a8\u2019\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bb9\u6613\u4e22\u5931\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u4eba\u5de5\u8d85\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e09\u79cd\u66ff\u4ee3\u6027\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u601d\u8def\uff1a1\uff09\u2018\u5b58\u50a8\u540e\u6309\u9700\u63d0\u53d6\u2019\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4ee5\u4f9b\u7075\u6d3b\u5e94\u7528\uff1b2\uff09\u4ece\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6982\u7387\u6027\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u6316\u6398\u6df1\u5c42\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u5b58\u50a8\u7ecf\u9a8c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6536\u96c6\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7406\u5ff5\u5728\u907f\u514d\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u2018\u5b58\u50a8\u540e\u6309\u9700\u63d0\u53d6\u2019\u7b49\u65b9\u5411\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u56f4\u7ed5\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u5171\u4eab\u673a\u5236\u5c55\u5f00\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u7d22\u3002"}}

However, the security of LVLMs, in particular in a long-context multi-turn setting, is largely underexplored. In this paper, we consider the realistic scenario in which an attacker uploads a manipulated image to the web/social media. A benign user downloads this image and uses it as input to the LVLM. Our novel stealthy Visual Memory Injection (VMI) attack is designed such that on normal prompts the LVLM exhibits nominal behavior, but once the user gives a triggering prompt, the LVLM outputs a specific prescribed target message to manipulate the user, e.g. for adversarial marketing or political persuasion. Compared to previous work that focused on single-turn attacks, VMI is effective even after a long multi-turn conversation with the user. We demonstrate our attack on several recent open-weight LVLMs. This article thereby shows that large-scale manipulation of users is feasible with perturbed images in multi-turn conversation settings, calling for better robustness of LVLMs against these attacks.

Despite notable progress, most existing methods represent student learning solely as exercise sequences, overlooking rich behavioral interaction information. This limited representation often leads to biased and unreliable estimates of learning progress. Moreover, fixed-length sequence segmentation limits the incorporation of early learning experiences, thereby hindering the modeling of long-term dependencies and the accurate estimation of knowledge mastery. To address these limitations, we propose BamaER, a Behavior-aware memory-augmented Exercise Recommendation framework that comprises three core modules: (i) the learning progress prediction module that captures heterogeneous student interaction behaviors via a tri-directional hybrid encoding scheme; (ii) the memory-augmented knowledge tracing module that maintains a dynamic memory matrix to jointly model historical and current knowledge states for robust mastery estimation; and (iii) the exercise filtering module that formulates candidate selection as a diversity-aware optimization problem, solved via the Hippopotamus Optimization Algorithm to reduce redundancy and improve recommendation coverage. Experiments on five real-world educational datasets show that BamaER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a range of evaluation metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "BamaER\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u884c\u4e3a\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u4f5c\u4e1a\u63a8\u8350\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u6a21\u5757\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ec3\u4e60\u5e8f\u5217\u3001\u5ffd\u7565\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u957f\u671f\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u5411\u6df7\u5408\u7f16\u7801\u6355\u6349\u5f02\u6784\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u77e9\u9635\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u77e5\u8bc6\u72b6\u6001\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u638c\u63e1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u54c8\u6ce2\u683c\u62c9\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u6027\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f5c\u4e1a\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5c06\u5b66\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u7ec3\u4e60\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u56fa\u5b9a\u957f\u5ea6\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u5272\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u65e9\u671f\u5b66\u4e60\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u878d\u5165\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u957f\u671f\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u638c\u63e1\u5ea6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBamaER\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757\uff1a(i) \u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u5411\u6df7\u5408\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u6355\u6349\u5f02\u6784\u5b66\u751f\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b(ii) \u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u77e9\u9635\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u5386\u53f2\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u77e5\u8bc6\u72b6\u6001\uff1b(iii) \u4f5c\u4e1a\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c06\u5019\u9009\u9009\u62e9\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u6837\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u54c8\u6ce2\u683c\u62c9\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6559\u80b2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBamaER\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "BamaER\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u5b66\u751f\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u957f\u671f\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4f5c\u4e1a\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002"}}

Results indicate moderate convergent validity (r=0.38-0.58), with Conscientiousness, Openness, and Neuroticism scores statistically equivalent between methods.

Text-Recognition Mediates Spatial Reasoning Across Three Model Families", "comment": "9 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables. Workshop-length paper", "summary": "We present a simple experiment that exposes a fundamental limitation in vision-language models (VLMs): the inability to accurately localize filled cells in binary grids when those cells lack textual identity. We generate fifteen 15x15 grids with varying density (10.7%-41.8% filled cells) and render each as two image types -- text symbols (. and #) and filled squares without gridlines -- then ask three frontier VLMs (Claude Opus, ChatGPT 5.2, and Gemini 3 Thinking) to transcribe them. In the text-symbol condition, Claude and ChatGPT achieve approximately 91% cell accuracy and 84% F1, while Gemini achieves 84% accuracy and 63% F1. In the filled-squares condition, all three models collapse to 60-73% accuracy and 29-39% F1. Critically, all conditions pass through the same visual encoder -- the text symbols are images, not tokenized text. The text-vs-squares F1 gap ranges from 34 to 54 points across models, demonstrating that VLMs behave as if they possess a high-fidelity text-recognition pathway for spatial reasoning that dramatically outperforms their native visual pathway. Each model exhibits a distinct failure mode in the squares condition -- systematic under-counting (Claude), massive over-counting (ChatGPT), and template hallucination (Gemini) -- but all share the same underlying deficit: severely degraded spatial localization for non-textual visual elements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u6587\u672c\u7b26\u53f7\u4e0e\u586b\u5145\u65b9\u5757\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u975e\u6587\u672c\u89c6\u89c9\u5143\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0a\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u5728\u6587\u672c\u7b26\u53f7\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff1b\u4f46\u5728\u4ec5\u7528\u586b\u5145\u65b9\u5757\u8868\u793a\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\u8def\u5f84\u8fdb\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u539f\u59cb\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65e0\u6587\u672c\u6807\u8bc6\u7684\u4e8c\u503c\u7f51\u683c\u65f6\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u53ca\u5bf9\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u751f\u621015\u4e2a15x15\u7684\u4e8c\u503c\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u540c\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0810.7%-41.8%\u586b\u5145\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u6587\u672c\u7b26\u53f7\uff08.\u548c#\uff09\u548c\u65e0\u7f51\u683c\u7ebf\u7684\u586b\u5145\u65b9\u5757\u4e24\u79cd\u5f62\u5f0f\u5448\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbfVLM\uff08Claude Opus\u3001ChatGPT 5.2\u3001Gemini 3 Thinking\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8f6c\u5f55\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5176\u5728\u4e24\u7c7b\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6587\u672c\u7b26\u53f7\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7ea691%\uff0cF1\u7ea684%\uff1b\u5728\u586b\u5145\u65b9\u5757\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u964d\u81f360-73%\uff0cF1\u964d\u81f329-39%\u3002\u5404\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4f4e\u4f30\uff08Claude\uff09\u3001\u4e25\u91cd\u9ad8\u4f30\uff08ChatGPT\uff09\u3001\u6a21\u677f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff08Gemini\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5171\u540c\u7f3a\u9677\u662f\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5b9a\u4f4d\u975e\u6587\u672c\u89c6\u89c9\u5143\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6587\u672c\u6807\u8bc6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\u8def\u5f84\u8fdb\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5176\u539f\u751f\u89c6\u89c9\u8def\u5f84\u5728\u5904\u7406\u975e\u6587\u672c\u89c6\u89c9\u5143\u7d20\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u51fa\u6839\u672c\u6027\u5c40\u9650\u3002"}}

To bridge this gap, we develop IntelliReward, a novel reward model built from a frozen autoregressive LLM with trainable multi-head transformers over the final 50 token states, which outperforms API-based SFT baselines in predicting expert-level human preferences. By applying Decoupled Clip and Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO) with IntelliReward, we train IntelliAsk, a question-generation model aligned with human standards of effort, evidence, and grounding. We find consistent improvements on reasoning and writing benchmarks, suggesting reviewer-question quality correlates with broader capabilities. Compared to the Qwen3-32B base model, IntelliAsk shows measurable gains across diverse benchmarks, specifically improving performance on reasoning tasks like MuSR (68.3 vs 64.7 Acc) and complex writing evaluations such as WritingBench (8.31 vs 8.07).

Recent work showed that mutual cooperation can be induced between \"learning-aware\" agents that account for and shape the learning dynamics of their co-players. However, existing approaches typically rely on hardcoded, often inconsistent, assumptions about co-player learning rules or enforce a strict separation between \"naive learners\" updating on fast timescales and \"meta-learners\" observing these updates. Here, we demonstrate that the in-context learning capabilities of sequence models allow for co-player learning awareness without requiring hardcoded assumptions or explicit timescale separation. We show that training sequence model agents against a diverse distribution of co-players naturally induces in-context best-response strategies, effectively functioning as learning algorithms on the fast intra-episode timescale. We find that the cooperative mechanism identified in prior work-where vulnerability to extortion drives mutual shaping-emerges naturally in this setting: in-context adaptation renders agents vulnerable to extortion, and the resulting mutual pressure to shape the opponent's in-context learning dynamics resolves into the learning of cooperative behavior. Our results suggest that standard decentralized reinforcement learning on sequence models combined with co-player diversity provides a scalable path to learning cooperative behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u786c\u7f16\u7801\u5047\u8bbe\u6216\u663e\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5bf9\u5408\u4f5c\u8005\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5408\u4f5c\u8005\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u6d8c\u73b0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u54cd\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u56de\u5408\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u5408\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7531\u6613\u53d7\u52d2\u7d22\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u5f71\u54cd\u6240\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u5851\u9020\u673a\u5236\u5728\u6b64\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u81ea\u53d1\u51fa\u73b0\uff1a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9002\u5e94\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6613\u53d7\u52d2\u7d22\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5f62\u6210\u5bf9\u5bf9\u624b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u6f14\u5316\u4e3a\u5408\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5408\u4f5c\u8005\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u5408\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u81ea\u5229\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u5408\u4f5c\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6839\u672c\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5408\u4f5c\u8005\u5b66\u4e60\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u786c\u7f16\u7801\u5047\u8bbe\u6216\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u7684\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5408\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5408\u4f5c\u8005\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u56de\u5408\u5185\u6839\u636e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5408\u4f5c\u8005\u5b66\u4e60\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\uff1b\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u8bbe\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u89c4\u5219\u6216\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5212\u5206\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u81ea\u7136\u6d8c\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u54cd\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5408\u4f5c\u8005\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u81ea\u7136\u4ea7\u751f\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u54cd\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u81ea\u53d1\u5f62\u6210\u5408\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u6613\u53d7\u52d2\u7d22\u7684\u7279\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u76f8\u4e92\u8c03\u6574\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u4fc3\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u786c\u7f16\u7801\u5047\u8bbe\u6216\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5408\u4f5c\u8005\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u5408\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u7136\u4ea7\u751f\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5148\u8bbe\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u89c4\u5219\u6216\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing registration methods, constrained by brightness constancy assumptions, achieve limited alignment quality, while recent generative approaches address domain shift through complex architectures that lack temporal awareness across frames. We propose GPEReg-Net, a scene-appearance disentanglement framework that separates domain-invariant scene features from domain-specific appearance codes via Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN), enabling direct image-to-image registration without explicit deformation field estimation. To exploit temporal structure in sequential acquisitions, we introduce a Global Position Encoding (GPE) module that combines learnable position embeddings with sinusoidal encoding and cross-frame attention, allowing the network to leverage context from neighboring frames for improved temporal coherence. On the OR-PAM-Reg-4K benchmark (432 test samples), GPEReg-Net achieves NCC of 0.953, SSIM of 0.932, and PSNR of 34.49dB, surpassing the state-of-the-art by 3.8% in SSIM and 1.99dB in PSNR while maintaining competitive NCC.

It searches for the P300 event-related potential (ERP) elicited by target stimuli, distinguishing it from the neural responses to non-target stimuli embedded in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Conventional methods require a lengthy calibration procedure to construct the binary classifier, which reduced overall efficiency. Thus, we proposed a unified framework with minimum calibration effort such that, given a small amount of labeled calibration data, we employed an adaptive semi-supervised EM-GMM algorithm to update the binary classifier. We evaluated our method based on character-level prediction accuracy, information transfer rate (ITR), and BCI utility. We applied calibration on training data and reported results on testing data. Our results indicate that, out of 15 participants, 9 participants exceed the minimum character-level accuracy of 0.7 using either on our adaptive method or the benchmark, and 7 out of these 9 participants showed that our adaptive method performed better than the benchmark. The proposed semi-supervised learning framework provides a practical and efficient alternative to improve the overall spelling efficiency in the real-time BCI speller system, particularly in contexts with limited labeled data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eP300 ERP\u7684\u8111\u673a\u63a5\u53e3\u62fc\u5199\u5668\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u534a\u76d1\u7763EM-GMM\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u66f4\u65b0\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6821\u51c6\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c15\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u4e2d\u67099\u4eba\u5b57\u7b26\u7ea7\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc70.7\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d7\u4eba\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u8111\u673a\u63a5\u53e3\u62fc\u5199\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfP300 BCI\u62fc\u5199\u5668\u9700\u8981\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u6821\u51c6\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u6548\u7387\u3002\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u5c11\u6821\u51c6\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u534a\u76d1\u7763EM-GMM\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6821\u51c6\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u572815\u540d\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u4e2d\uff0c9\u4eba\u5b57\u7b26\u7ea7\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc70.7\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d7\u4eba\u4f7f\u7528\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u8f93\u7387\u548cBCI\u6548\u7528\u5747\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u6821\u51c6\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u65f6\u8111\u673a\u63a5\u53e3\u62fc\u5199\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The system introduces a mapping-first paradigm that separates form understanding from answer generation, enabling consistent reasoning across heterogeneous application portals. EZCollegeApp integrates document ingestion from official admissions websites, retrieval-augmented question answering, and a human-in-the-loop chatbot interface that presents suggestions alongside application fields without automated submission.

Natural language is interpretable but vulnerable to semantic drift, while learned protocols are efficient but opaque. We propose a certification protocol based on the stimulus-meaning model, where agents are tested on shared observable events and terms are certified if empirical disagreement falls below a statistical threshold. In this protocol, agents restricting their reasoning to certified terms (\"core-guarded reasoning\") achieve provably bounded disagreement.

While recent deep learning models have achieved strong average accuracy, the increasing frequency and intensity of climate-driven extreme weather events pose severe threats to grid stability and operational security. Consequently, developing robust forecasting models that can withstand volatile conditions has become a paramount challenge. In this paper, we present R$^2$Energy, a large-scale benchmark for NWP-assisted renewable energy forecasting. It comprises over 10.7 million high-fidelity hourly records from 902 wind and solar stations across four provinces in China, providing the diverse meteorological conditions necessary to capture the wide-ranging variability of renewable generation. We further establish a standardized, leakage-free forecasting paradigm that grants all models identical access to future Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) signals, enabling fair and reproducible comparison across state-of-the-art representative forecasting architectures. Beyond aggregate accuracy, we incorporate regime-wise evaluation with expert-aligned extreme weather annotations, uncovering a critical ``robustness gap'' typically obscured by average metrics. This gap reveals a stark robustness-complexity trade-off: under extreme conditions, a model's reliability is driven by its meteorological integration strategy rather than its architectural complexity. R$^2$Energy provides a principled foundation for evaluating and developing forecasting models for safety-critical power system applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faR\u00b2Energy\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u503c\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\uff08NWP\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e2d\u56fd\u56db\u4e2a\u7701\u4efd902\u4e2a\u98ce\u80fd\u548c\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u7535\u7ad9\u76841070\u4e07\u6761\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5c0f\u65f6\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3001\u65e0\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u4e0b\u88ab\u63a9\u76d6\u7684\u201c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u201d\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u5929\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5176\u6c14\u8c61\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u800c\u975e\u67b6\u6784\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5f00\u53d1\u7a33\u5065\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u98ce\u7535\u548c\u5149\u4f0f\u7b49\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6269\u5f20\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u7535\u7f51\u8fd0\u884c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6c14\u5019\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u5929\u6c14\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9891\u53d1\u4e14\u5f3a\u5ea6\u52a0\u5267\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u7535\u7f51\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e0e\u8fd0\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u5e94\u5bf9\u6ce2\u52a8\u73af\u5883\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b10.7\u4e07\u5c0f\u65f6\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684R\u00b2Energy\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8986\u76d64\u4e2a\u7701\u4efd902\u4e2a\u7ad9\u70b9\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3001\u65e0\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u63d0\u4f9b\u672a\u6765NWP\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u6309\u6c14\u8c61\u72b6\u6001\u5212\u5206\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u5929\u6c14\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u7684\u201c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u201d\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u5929\u6c14\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u5176\u6c14\u8c61\u4fe1\u606f\u6574\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u67b6\u6784\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff1b\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u578b\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "R\u00b2Energy\u4e3a\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u6781\u7aef\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6c14\u8c61\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Liu", "Aditya Joshi", "Paul Dawson"], "title": "Narrative Theory-Driven LLM Methods for Automatic Story Generation and Understanding: A Survey", "comment": "31 pages", "summary": "Applications of narrative theories using large language models (LLMs) deliver promising use-cases in automatic story generation and understanding tasks. Our survey examines how natural language processing (NLP) research engages with fields of narrative studies, and proposes a taxonomy for ongoing efforts that reflect established distinctions in narratology. We discover patterns in the following: narrative datasets and tasks, narrative theories and NLP pipeline and methodological trends in prompting and fine-tuning. We highlight how LLMs enable easy connections of NLP pipelines with abstract narrative concepts and opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration. Challenges remain in attempts to work towards any unified definition or benchmark of narrative related tasks, making model comparison difficult. For future directions, instead of the pursuit of a single, generalised benchmark for 'narrative quality', we believe that progress benefits more from efforts that focus on the following: defining and improving theory-based metrics for individual narrative attributes to incrementally improve model performance; conducting large-scale, theory-driven literary/social/cultural analysis; and creating experiments where outputs can be used to validate or refine narrative theories. This work provides a contextual foundation for more systematic and theoretically informed narrative research in NLP by providing an overview to ongoing research efforts and the broader narrative studies landscape.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\uff08NLP\uff09\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u4e0e\u53d9\u4e8b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cd\u6620\u53d9\u4e8b\u5b66\u4e2d\u65e2\u6709\u533a\u5206\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u53d9\u4e8b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u53d9\u4e8b\u7406\u8bba\u4ee5\u53caNLP\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u8d8b\u52bf\uff08\u5982\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4f7fNLP\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e0e\u62bd\u8c61\u53d9\u4e8b\u6982\u5ff5\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u4fbf\u6377\u8054\u7cfb\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u5408\u4f5c\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9a\u4e49\u6216\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u5e94\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\uff1a\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u5c5e\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u9010\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5f00\u5c55\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6587\u5b66/\u793e\u4f1a/\u6587\u5316\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u7528\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6216\u4fee\u6b63\u53d9\u4e8b\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u66f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u7814\u7a76\u5728NLP\u4e2d\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6545\u4e8b\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e0e\u53d9\u4e8b\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u5c1a\u4e0d\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u8de8\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u6df1\u5316\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u68b3\u7406\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709NLP\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u53d9\u4e8b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5f52\u7eb3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u6280\u672f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u53d9\u4e8b\u7814\u7a76\u5728NLP\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\uff1a\u7406\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53d9\u4e8b\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u53d9\u4e8b\u76f8\u5173\u7684NLP\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5e94\u4ece\u5177\u4f53\u53d9\u4e8b\u5c5e\u6027\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u6280\u672f\u534f\u540c\u6f14\u8fdb\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8ffd\u6c42\u5355\u4e00\u7684\u2018\u53d9\u4e8b\u8d28\u91cf\u2019\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

However, existing AFE methods rely on statistical heuristics, yielding brittle features that fail under distribution shift. We introduce CAFE, a framework that reformulates AFE as a causally-guided sequential decision process, bridging causal discovery with reinforcement learning-driven feature construction. Phase I learns a sparse directed acyclic graph over features and the target to obtain soft causal priors, grouping features as direct, indirect, or other based on their causal influence with respect to the target. Phase II uses a cascading multi-agent deep Q-learning architecture to select causal groups and transformation operators, with hierarchical reward shaping and causal group-level exploration strategies that favor causally plausible transformations while controlling feature complexity. Across 15 public benchmarks (classification with macro-F1; regression with inverse relative absolute error), CAFE achieves up to 7% improvement over strong AFE baselines, reduces episodes-to-convergence, and delivers competitive time-to-target. Under controlled covariate shifts, CAFE reduces performance drop by ~4x relative to a non-causal multi-agent baseline, and produces more compact feature sets with more stable post-hoc attributions. These findings underscore that causal structure, used as a soft inductive prior rather than a rigid constraint, can substantially improve the robustness and efficiency of automated feature engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "CAFE \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u6784\u9020\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u8f6f\u56e0\u679c\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u7ea7\u8054\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6df1\u5ea6Q\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c42\u6b21\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u7ec4\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u7ec4\u548c\u53d8\u6362\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u572815\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cCAFE\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe7%\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea64\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u548c\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7edf\u8ba1\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u8106\u5f31\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "CAFE \u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a(1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u95f4\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\uff0c\u83b7\u53d6\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u7ec4\uff08\u76f4\u63a5\u3001\u95f4\u63a5\u3001\u5176\u4ed6\uff09\u7684\u8f6f\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b(2) \u4f7f\u7528\u7ea7\u8054\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6df1\u5ea6Q\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c42\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u7ec4\u7ea7\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u56e0\u679c\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\u4e0e\u53d8\u6362\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u572815\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cCAFE\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad87%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff1b\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u6bd4\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u57fa\u7ebf\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea64\u500d\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\uff0c\u540e\u5904\u7406\u5f52\u56e0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u5f52\u7eb3\u5148\u9a8c\u800c\u975e\u521a\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, contact-based sensors such as pulse oximeters may cause skin irritation, increase infection risk, and lead to patient discomfort. Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) offers a contactless alternative to monitor heart rate using facial video, but remains underutilized in PICUs due to motion artifacts, occlusions, variable lighting, and domain shifts between laboratory and clinical data.\n  We introduce a self-supervised pretraining framework for rPPG estimation in the PICU setting, based on a progressive curriculum strategy. The approach leverages the VisionMamba architecture and integrates an adaptive masking mechanism, where a lightweight Mamba-based controller assigns spatiotemporal importance scores to guide probabilistic patch sampling. This strategy dynamically increases reconstruction difficulty while preserving physiological relevance.\n  To address the lack of labeled clinical data, we adopt a teacher-student distillation setup. A supervised expert model, trained on public datasets, provides latent physiological guidance to the student. The curriculum progresses through three stages: clean public videos, synthetic occlusion scenarios, and unlabeled videos from 500 pediatric patients.\n  Our framework achieves a 42% reduction in mean absolute error relative to standard masked autoencoders and outperforms PhysFormer by 31%, reaching a final MAE of 3.2 bpm.

However, their iterative sampling nature results in high inference latency. While recent distillation techniques accelerate sampling, they discard intermediate trajectory steps. This sparse supervision leads to a loss of structural information and introduces significant discretization errors. To mitigate this, we propose B-DENSE, a novel framework that leverages multi-branch trajectory alignment. We modify the student architecture to output $K$-fold expanded channels, where each subset corresponds to a specific branch representing a discrete intermediate step in the teacher's trajectory. By training these branches to simultaneously map to the entire sequence of the teacher's target timesteps, we enforce dense intermediate trajectory alignment. Consequently, the student model learns to navigate the solution space from the earliest stages of training, demonstrating superior image generation quality compared to baseline distillation frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faB-DENSE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5206\u652f\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b9e\u73b0\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u751f\u7aef\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\u5728\u52a0\u901f\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u4e22\u5f03\u4e2d\u95f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u548c\u663e\u8457\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u4fee\u6539\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8f93\u51faK\u500d\u6269\u5c55\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5206\u652f\u5bf9\u5e94\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u79bb\u6563\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u5404\u5206\u652f\u540c\u65f6\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6559\u5e08\u76ee\u6807\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bc6\u96c6\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u521d\u671f\u5373\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5bfc\u822a\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "B-DENSE\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5206\u652f\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

However, note-based models are particularly vulnerable to temporal and lexical leakage, where documentation artifacts encode future clinical decisions and inflate apparent predictive performance. Such behavior poses substantial risks for real-world deployment, where overconfident or temporally invalid predictions can disrupt clinical workflows and compromise patient safety. This study focuses on system-level design choices required to build safe and deployable clinical NLP under temporal leakage constraints. We present a lightweight auditing pipeline that integrates interpretability into the model development process to identify and suppress leakage-prone signals prior to final training. Using next-day discharge prediction after elective spine surgery as a case study, we evaluate how auditing affects predictive behavior, calibration, and safety-relevant trade-offs. Results show that audited models exhibit more conservative and better-calibrated probability estimates, with reduced reliance on discharge-related lexical cues. These findings emphasize that deployment-ready clinical NLP systems should prioritize temporal validity, calibration, and behavioral robustness over optimistic performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5c06\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u878d\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u65f6\u95f4\u6cc4\u6f0f\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u4e34\u5e8aNLP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u4ee5\u62e9\u671f\u810a\u67f1\u624b\u672f\u540e\u6b21\u65e5\u51fa\u9662\u9884\u6d4b\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4fdd\u5b88\u3001\u66f4\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5bf9\u51fa\u9662\u76f8\u5173\u8bcd\u6c47\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u65f6\u95f4\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4e50\u89c2\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u652f\u6301\u533b\u9662\u51fa\u9662\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u4e8e\u75c5\u5386\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u8bcd\u6c47\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5373\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u53ef\u80fd\u9690\u542b\u672a\u6765\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u88ab\u4eba\u4e3a\u5938\u5927\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u56e0\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u6216\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u65e0\u6548\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u800c\u5e72\u6270\u4e34\u5e8a\u6d41\u7a0b\u3001\u5371\u53ca\u60a3\u8005\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5c06\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u6574\u5408\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u6291\u5236\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u65f6\u95f4\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u7ec8\u8bad\u7ec3\u524d\u8fdb\u884c\u5e72\u9884\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u53ca\u5b89\u5168\u76f8\u5173\u6743\u8861\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4fdd\u5b88\u4e14\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u51fa\u9662\u76f8\u5173\u8bcd\u6c47\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u4e34\u5e8aNLP\u7cfb\u7edf\u5fc5\u987b\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u65f6\u95f4\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u6982\u7387\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8ffd\u6c42\u8868\u9762\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5ba1\u8ba1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u9632\u8303\u65f6\u95f4\u6cc4\u6f0f\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u533b\u7597\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002"}}

While expert knowledge is required to construct principled causal graphs, many statistical methods have been proposed to leverage observational data with varying formal guarantees. Causal Assumption-based Argumentation (ABA) is a framework that uses symbolic reasoning to ensure correspondence between input constraints and output graphs, while offering a principled way to combine data and expertise. We explore the use of large language models (LLMs) as imperfect experts for Causal ABA, eliciting semantic structural priors from variable names and descriptions and integrating them with conditional-independence evidence. Experiments on standard benchmarks and semantically grounded synthetic graphs demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and we additionally introduce an evaluation protocol to mitigate memorisation bias when assessing LLMs for causal discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u5047\u8bbe\u8bba\u8bc1\uff08Causal ABA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u79f0\u548c\u63cf\u8ff0\u63d0\u53d6\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u6216\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b\u800c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5177\u5907\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6574\u5408\u5176\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u3001\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u56e0\u679c\u5047\u8bbe\u8bba\u8bc1\uff08Causal ABA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5176\u5bf9\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u548c\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u6784\u5efa\u7b26\u5408\u8f93\u5165\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u51cf\u8f7b\u6a21\u578b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6784\u9020\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u865a\u5047\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56e0\u679c\u5047\u8bbe\u8bba\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9LLM\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Despite the meteoric rise in the number of neuromorphic datasets published over the past ten years, the conclusion of a significant portion of neuromorphic research papers still states that there is a need for yet more data and even larger datasets. Whilst this need is driven in part by the sheer volume of data required by modern deep learning approaches, it is also fuelled by the current state of the available neuromorphic datasets and the difficulties in finding them, understanding their purpose, and determining the nature of their underlying task. This is further compounded by practical difficulties in downloading and using these datasets. This review starts by capturing a snapshot of the existing neuromorphic datasets, covering over 423 datasets, and then explores the nature of their tasks and the underlying structure of the presented data. Analysing these datasets shows the difficulties arising from their size, the lack of standardisation, and difficulties in accessing the actual data. This paper also highlights the growth in the size of individual datasets and the complexities involved in working with the data. However, a more important concern is the rise of synthetic datasets, created by either simulation or video-to-events methods. This review explores the benefits of simulated data for testing existing algorithms and applications, highlighting the potential pitfalls for exploring new applications of neuromorphic technologies. This review also introduces the concepts of meta-datasets, created from existing datasets, as a way of both reducing the need for more data, and to remove potential bias arising from defining both the dataset and the task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7efc\u8ff0\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc7423\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u7814\u7a76\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3001\u89c4\u6a21\u5e9e\u5927\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u4eff\u771f\u6216\u89c6\u9891\u8f6c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\uff09\u7684\u5174\u8d77\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5143\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u7814\u7a76\u666e\u904d\u53cd\u6620\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u6e05\u6670\uff0c\u4e14\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6cdb\u6ee5\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u65b0\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u8d44\u6e90\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u5206\u6790\u8d85\u8fc7423\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u8d28\u3001\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u53ca\u6765\u6e90\uff08\u771f\u5b9e\u6216\u5408\u6210\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5143\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u4e0d\u4e00\u3001\u8bbf\u95ee\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u867d\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7b97\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u5143\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u538b\u529b\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u63a8\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e0e\u5171\u4eab\u673a\u5236\u5efa\u8bbe\uff0c\u5408\u7406\u5229\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u79ef\u6781\u53d1\u5c55\u5143\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Such an arm setting finds applications in many real-world problems, for example, mmWave communications and portfolio management with risky assets, as a result of the universality of the Gaussian distribution. Based on the Thompson Sampling algorithm with Gaussian prior (TSG) algorithm for the selection of the optimal arm, we propose our Thompson Sampling with Clustered arms under Gaussian prior (TSCG) specific to the 2-level hierarchical structure. We prove that by utilizing the 2-level structure, we can achieve a lower regret bound than we do with ordinary TSG. In addition, when the reward is Unimodal, we can reach an even lower bound on the regret by our Unimodal Thompson Sampling algorithm with Clustered Arms under Gaussian prior (UTSCG). Each of our proposed algorithms are accompanied by theoretical evaluation of the upper regret bound, and our numerical experiments confirm the advantage of our proposed algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u7c7b\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u65af\u5956\u52b1\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u81c2\u591a\u81c2\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\uff08MAB\uff09\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u4e24\u5c42\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd5TSCG\u548c\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u5cf0\u5956\u52b1\u7684UTSCG\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfTSG\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u540e\u6094\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u8d44\u4ea7\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u65af\u5956\u52b1\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u81c2MAB\u95ee\u9898\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u610f\u4e49\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faTSCG\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u4e24\u5c42\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u4e3a\u5355\u5cf0\u65f6\u5f15\u5165UTSCG\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u6c64\u666e\u68ee\u91c7\u6837\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e24\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u540e\u6094\u4e0a\u754c\uff1b\u5f53\u5956\u52b1\u4e3a\u5355\u5cf0\u65f6\uff0cUTSCG\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u964d\u4f4e\u540e\u6094\u8fb9\u754c\uff1b\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5355\u5cf0\u6027\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684TSCG\u548cUTSCG\u7b97\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfTSG\uff0c\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, most existing schemes require users to define static, problem-specific reasoning structures that lack adaptability to dynamic or unseen problem types. Additionally, these schemes are often under-optimized in terms of hyperparameters, prompts, runtime, and prompting cost. To address these limitations, we introduce Framework of Thoughts (FoT)--a general-purpose foundation framework for building and optimizing dynamic reasoning schemes. FoT comes with built-in features for hyperparameter tuning, prompt optimization, parallel execution, and intelligent caching, unlocking the latent performance potential of reasoning schemes. We demonstrate FoT's capabilities by implementing three popular schemes--Tree of Thoughts, Graph of Thoughts, and ProbTree--within FoT. We empirically show that FoT enables significantly faster execution, reduces costs, and achieves better task scores through optimization.

As a consequence, they tend to generate samples from only a narrow portion of the feasible domain. This is a fundamental limitation for scientific discovery applications, where one typically aims to sample valid designs beyond the available data distribution. To this end, we address the challenge of leveraging access to a verifier (e.g., an atomic bonds checker), to adapt a pre-trained flow model so that its induced density expands beyond regions of high data availability, while preserving samples validity. We introduce formal notions of strong and weak verifiers and propose algorithmic frameworks for global and local flow expansion via probability-space optimization. Then, we present Flow Expander (FE), a scalable mirror descent scheme that provably tackles both problems by verifier-constrained entropy maximization over the flow process noised state space. Next, we provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed method, and state convergence guarantees under both idealized and general assumptions.

However, its scalability is hindered by excessive context length and redundant retrievals. Recent research on soft context compression aims to address this by encoding long documents into compact embeddings, yet they often underperform non-compressed RAG due to their reliance on auto-encoder-like full-compression that forces the encoder to compress all document information regardless of relevance to the input query.\n  In this work, we conduct an analysis on this paradigm and reveal two fundamental limitations: (I) Infeasibility, full-compression conflicts with the LLM's downstream generation behavior; and (II) Non-necessity: full-compression is unnecessary and dilutes task-relevant information density. Motivated by these insights, we introduce SeleCom, a selector-based soft compression framework for RAG that redefines the encoder's role as query-conditioned information selector. The selector is decoder-only and is trained with a massive, diverse and difficulty-graded synthetic QA dataset with curriculum learning.\n  Extensive experiments show that SeleCom significantly outperforms existing soft compression approaches and achieves competitive or superior performance to non-compression baselines, while reducing computation and latency by 33.8%~84.6%.", "AI": {"tldr": "SeleCom\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u7684\u8f6f\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u67e5\u8be2\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u9009\u62e9\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u5168\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3RAG\u4e2d\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fc7\u957f\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u68c0\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8f6f\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e33.8%~84.6%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8f6f\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u538b\u7f29\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u88ab\u5f3a\u5236\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5168\u538b\u7f29\u4e0eLLM\u751f\u6210\u884c\u4e3a\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4e14\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u7ea7\u7684\u5408\u6210QA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6587\u6863\u4fe1\u606f\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "SeleCom\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u8f6f\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e3a\u67e5\u8be2\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u9009\u62e9\u5668\uff0cSeleCom\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5168\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55RAG\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

MedProbCLIP models image and text representations as Gaussian embeddings through a probabilistic contrastive objective that explicitly captures uncertainty and many-to-many correspondences between radiographs and clinical narratives.

The resulting prediction regions, geodesic caps on the sphere, have position-independent area and adapt their size to local prediction difficulty, yielding substantially more uniform conditional coverage than non-adaptive alternatives. In a synthetic sphere experiment with strong heteroscedasticity and a real-world geomagnetic field forecasting task derived from IGRF-14 satellite data, the adaptive method markedly reduces conditional coverage variability and raises worst-case coverage much closer to the nominal level, while coordinate-based baselines waste a large fraction of coverage area due to chart distortion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u975e\u5171\u5f62\u5f97\u5206\u66ff\u4ee3\u6b27\u6c0f\u6b8b\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7403\u9762\u7b49\u9ece\u66fc\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u751f\u6210\u4f4d\u7f6e\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u5e3d\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u80fd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5c40\u90e8\u9884\u6d4b\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6761\u4ef6\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u7684\u5747\u5300\u6027\u3002\u5728\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u6027\u7684\u5408\u6210\u7403\u9762\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eIGRF-14\u536b\u661f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u78c1\u573a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u6761\u4ef6\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u4f7f\u6700\u5dee\u60c5\u51b5\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u540d\u4e49\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5750\u6807\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u5750\u6807\u56fe\u626d\u66f2\u6d6a\u8d39\u5927\u91cf\u8986\u76d6\u9762\u79ef\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u8f93\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e3a\u6b27\u6c0f\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u54cd\u5e94\u4f4d\u4e8e\u9ece\u66fc\u6d41\u5f62\uff08\u5982\u7403\u9762\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u57df\u6821\u51c6\u6548\u679c\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u56e0\u5750\u6807\u56fe\u626d\u66f2\u5bfc\u81f4\u8986\u76d6\u9762\u79ef\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u6d41\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u6761\u4ef6\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5c06\u975e\u5171\u5f62\u5f97\u5206\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u56e0\u5b50\u5bf9\u5f97\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u5e3d\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u9762\u79ef\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5927\u5c0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u7403\u9762\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u78c1\u573a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6761\u4ef6\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u5dee\u60c5\u51b5\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u81f3\u63a5\u8fd1\u540d\u4e49\u6c34\u5e73\uff1b\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u5750\u6807\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u56fe\u5931\u771f\u9020\u6210\u5927\u91cf\u8986\u76d6\u9762\u79ef\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u9ece\u66fc\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u56de\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5747\u5300\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b58\u5728\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u6027\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a novel Collaborative Reasoning and Adaptive Fusion (CRAF) framework that systematically integrates traditional feature-based methods with large language models (LLMs) through a structured multi-stage reasoning mechanism. Our approach features four key innovations: (1) a cross-platform collaborative attention module that aligns semantic representations while preserving source-specific characteristics, (2) a hierarchical adaptive fusion mechanism that dynamically weights features based on both data quality and task requirements, (3) a joint optimization strategy that simultaneously learns topic representations and sentiment distributions through shared latent spaces, and (4) a novel multimodal extraction capability that processes video content from platforms like Douyin and Kuaishou by integrating OCR, ASR, and visual sentiment analysis. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that CRAF achieves a tighter generalization bound with a reduction of O(sqrt(d log K / m)) compared to independent source modeling, where d is feature dimensionality, K is the number of sources, and m is sample size. Comprehensive experiments on three multi-platform datasets (Weibo-12, CrossPlatform-15, NewsForum-8) show that CRAF achieves an average topic clustering ARI of 0.76 (4.1% improvement over best baseline) and sentiment analysis F1-score of 0.84 (3.8% improvement). The framework exhibits strong cross-platform adaptability, reducing the labeled data requirement for new platforms by 75%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\uff08CRAF\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6e90\u5f02\u6784\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u8206\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6311\u6218\u3002\u521b\u65b0\u70b9\u5305\u62ec\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u534f\u540c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3001\u5206\u5c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u3001\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u53ca\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u754c\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u4e3b\u9898\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u65b0\u5e73\u53f0\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u51cf\u5c1175%\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6e90\u5f02\u6784\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u8206\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u9762\u4e34\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5f02\u548c\u5e73\u53f0\u504f\u89c1\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6e90\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCRAF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u534f\u540c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u4ee5\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u6e90\u7279\u6027\uff1b\u5206\u5c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3b\u9898\u4e0e\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u4ee5\u53ca\u7ed3\u5408OCR\u3001ASR\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6296\u97f3\u3001\u5feb\u624b\u7b49\u89c6\u9891\u5e73\u53f0\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728Weibo-12\u3001CrossPlatform-15\u3001NewsForum-8\u4e09\u4e2a\u591a\u5e73\u53f0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCRAF\u5e73\u5747\u4e3b\u9898\u805a\u7c7bARI\u8fbe0.76\uff08\u8f83\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u53474.1%\uff09\uff0c\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790F1-score\u4e3a0.84\uff08\u63d0\u53473.8%\uff09\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u65b0\u5e73\u53f0\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e2d\u53ef\u51cf\u5c1175%\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CRAF\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u5bf9\u591a\u6e90\u5f02\u6784\u8206\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Clinical interpretation relies on both slice-driven local features (e.g., sub-centimeter nodules, lesion boundaries) and volume-driven spatial representations (e.g., tumor infiltration, inter-organ anatomical relations). However, existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain fragmented in CT slice versus volumetric understanding: slice-driven LVLMs show strong generalization but lack cross-slice spatial consistency, while volume-driven LVLMs explicitly capture volumetric semantics but suffer from coarse granularity and poor compatibility with slice inputs. The absence of a unified modeling paradigm constitutes a major bottleneck for the clinical translation of medical LVLMs. We present OmniCT, a powerful unified slice-volume LVLM for CT scenarios, which makes three contributions: (i) Spatial Consistency Enhancement (SCE): volumetric slice composition combined with tri-axial positional embedding that introduces volumetric consistency, and an MoE hybrid projection enables efficient slice-volume adaptation; (ii) Organ-level Semantic Enhancement (OSE): segmentation and ROI localization explicitly align anatomical regions, emphasizing lesion- and organ-level semantics; (iii) MedEval-CT: the largest slice-volume CT dataset and hybrid benchmark integrates comprehensive metrics for unified evaluation. OmniCT consistently outperforms existing methods with a substantial margin across diverse clinical tasks and satisfies both micro-level detail sensitivity and macro-level spatial reasoning. More importantly, it establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal medical imaging understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "OmniCT\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5207\u7247-\u4f53\u79ef\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5207\u7247\u4e0e\u4e09\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u7684\u5272\u88c2\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u5668\u5b98\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5207\u7247-\u4f53\u79ef\u6570\u636e\u96c6MedEval-CT\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b8f\u89c2\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u517c\u987e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728CT\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5207\u7247\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u4f53\u79ef\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5272\u88c2\uff1a\u5207\u7247\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u5207\u7247\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u4f53\u79ef\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u4e09\u7ef4\u8bed\u4e49\u5374\u7c92\u5ea6\u7c97\u7cd9\u4e14\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u5207\u7247\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u533b\u5b66\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u843d\u5730\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOmniCT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u9879\u6838\u5fc3\u6280\u672f\uff1a(i) \u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\uff08SCE\uff09\u2014\u2014\u901a\u8fc7\u4f53\u79ef\u5207\u7247\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0e\u4e09\u8f74\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528MoE\u6df7\u5408\u6295\u5f71\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5207\u7247-\u4f53\u79ef\u9002\u914d\uff1b(ii) \u5668\u5b98\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u589e\u5f3a\uff08OSE\uff09\u2014\u2014\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5272\u4e0e\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u75c5\u53d8\u4e0e\u5668\u5b98\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b(iii) MedEval-CT\u2014\u2014\u6784\u5efa\u6700\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5207\u7247-\u4f53\u79ef\u8054\u5408\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u6df7\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "OmniCT\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u5fae\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e0e\u5b8f\u89c2\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u5207\u7247\u4e0e\u4f53\u79ef\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u4e3a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "OmniCT\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5207\u7247-\u4f53\u79ef\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u533b\u7597\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Existing benchmarks overwhelmingly focus on standard performance metrics such as accuracy, BLEU, or mAP, while largely ignoring energy consumption and carbon emissions. This single-objective evaluation paradigm is increasingly misaligned with the practical requirements of large-scale deployment, particularly in energy-constrained environments such as mobile devices, developing regions, and climate-aware enterprises. In this paper, we propose AI-CARE, an evaluation tool for reporting energy consumption, and carbon emissions of ML models. In addition, we introduce the carbon-performance tradeoff curve, an interpretable tool that visualizes the Pareto frontier between performance and carbon cost. We demonstrate, through theoretical analysis and empirical validation on representative ML workloads, that carbon-aware benchmarking changes the relative ranking of models and encourages architectures that are simultaneously accurate and environmentally responsible. Our proposal aims to shift the research community toward transparent, multi-objective evaluation and align ML progress with global sustainability goals.

However, for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, this parallelism introduces a severe bottleneck: large draft trees activate many unique experts, significantly increasing memory pressure and diminishing speedups from speculative decoding relative to autoregressive decoding. Prior methods reduce speculation depth when MoE verification becomes expensive. We propose MoE-Spec, a training-free verification-time expert budgeting method that decouples speculation depth from memory cost by enforcing a fixed expert capacity limit at each layer, loading only the experts that contribute most to verification and dropping the long tail of rarely used experts that drive bandwidth overhead. Experiments across multiple model scales and datasets show that this method yields 10--30\\% higher throughput than state-of-the-art speculative decoding baselines (EAGLE-3) at comparable quality, with flexibility to trade accuracy for further latency reductions through tighter budgets.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoE-Spec\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9636\u6bb5\u4e13\u5bb6\u9884\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u5c42\u8bbe\u7f6e\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4ec5\u52a0\u8f7d\u5bf9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8d21\u732e\u6700\u5927\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u4e22\u5f03\u4f7f\u7528\u9891\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u201c\u957f\u5c3e\u201d\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u538b\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u5982EAGLE-3\uff0910\u201330%\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95f4\u7075\u6d3b\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728Mixture-of-Experts\uff08MoE\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u4f1a\u56e0\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u5927\u91cf\u8349\u7a3f\u4ee4\u724c\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u91cf\u552f\u4e00\u4e13\u5bb6\u88ab\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u4e3a\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63a7\u5236\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMoE-Spec\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3-free\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u6bcf\u5c42\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u91cf\u65bd\u52a0\u56fa\u5b9a\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u52a0\u8f7d\u5bf9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8d21\u732e\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4f7f\u7528\u9891\u7387\u6781\u4f4e\u7684\u201c\u957f\u5c3e\u201d\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5e26\u5bbd\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08EAGLE-3\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u4e8610\u201330%\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u4e13\u5bb6\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "MoE-Spec\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u63a8\u6d4b\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728MoE\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We propose Maniscope, a geometric reranking method that computes geodesic distances on k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) manifolds constructed over retrieved document candidates. This approach combines global cosine similarity with local manifold geometry to capture semantic structure that flat Euclidean metrics miss. Evaluating on eight BEIR benchmark datasets (1,233 queries), Maniscope outperforms HNSW graph-based baseline on the three hardest datasets (NFCorpus: +7.0%, TREC-COVID: +1.6%, AorB: +2.8% NDCG@3) while being 3.2x faster (4.7 ms vs 14.8 ms average). Compared to cross-encoder rerankers, Maniscope achieves within 2% accuracy at 10-45x lower latency.

While AI systems show therapeutic promise, current alignment approaches optimize objectives independently, failing to balance patient preferences with clinical safety. We survey 335 individuals with lived mental health experience to collect preference rankings across therapeutic dimensions, then develop a multi-objective alignment framework using direct preference optimization. We train reward models for six criteria -- empathy, safety, active listening, self-motivated change, trust/rapport, and patient autonomy -- and systematically compare multi-objective approaches against single-objective optimization, supervised fine-tuning, and parameter merging. Multi-objective DPO (MODPO) achieves superior balance (77.6% empathy, 62.6% safety) compared to single-objective optimization (93.6% empathy, 47.8% safety), and therapeutic criteria outperform general communication principles by 17.2%. Blinded clinician evaluation confirms MODPO is consistently preferred, with LLM-evaluator agreement comparable to inter-clinician reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u6cbb\u7597\u4e2d\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u60a3\u8005\u504f\u597d\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b89\u5168\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u67e5335\u540d\u6709\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u5176\u5bf9\u6cbb\u7597\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u504f\u597d\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff08MODPO\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u516d\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5171\u60c5\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u79ef\u6781\u503e\u542c\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u9a71\u52a8\u6539\u53d8\u3001\u4fe1\u4efb/\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u60a3\u8005\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\uff09\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cMODPO\u5728\u5171\u60c5\uff0877.6%\uff09\u548c\u5b89\u5168\uff0862.6%\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u4f18\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\uff0893.6%\u5171\u60c5\uff0c47.8%\u5b89\u5168\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u7597\u6548\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u6c9f\u901a\u539f\u521917.2%\u3002\u76f2\u6cd5\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660eMODPO\u88ab\u4e00\u81f4\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u4e14\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fbe\u5230\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u95f4\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u6cbb\u7597\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u72ec\u7acb\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u60a3\u8005\u504f\u597d\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08DPO\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e335\u540d\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u516d\u9879\u6838\u5fc3\u6cbb\u7597\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u5355\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u53ca\u53c2\u6570\u5408\u5e76\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "MODPO\u5728\u5171\u60c5\uff0877.6%\uff09\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\uff0862.6%\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\uff0893.6%\u5171\u60c5\uff0c47.8%\u5b89\u5168\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u6cbb\u7597\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8868\u73b0\u6bd4\u901a\u7528\u6c9f\u901a\u539f\u5219\u9ad8\u51fa17.2%\uff1b\u76f2\u6cd5\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u88ab\u4e00\u81f4\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6MODPO\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u534f\u8c03\u60a3\u8005\u504f\u597d\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7AI\u6cbb\u7597\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684AI\u5fc3\u7406\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Preprint", "summary": "Demographic bias in text-to-image (T2I) generation is well studied, yet demographic-conditioned failures in instruction-guided image-to-image (I2I) editing remain underexplored. We examine whether identical edit instructions yield systematically different outcomes across subject demographics in open-weight I2I editors. We formalize two failure modes: Soft Erasure, where edits are silently weakened or ignored in the output image, and Stereotype Replacement, where edits introduce unrequested, stereotype-consistent attributes. We introduce a controlled benchmark that probes demographic-conditioned behavior by generating and editing portraits conditioned on race, gender, and age using a diagnostic prompt set, and evaluate multiple editors with vision-language model (VLM) scoring and human evaluation. Our analysis shows that identity preservation failures are pervasive, demographically uneven, and shaped by implicit social priors, including occupation-driven gender inference. Finally, we demonstrate that a prompt-level identity constraint, without model updates, can substantially reduce demographic change for minority groups while leaving majority-group portraits largely unchanged, revealing asymmetric identity priors in current editors. Together, our findings establish identity preservation as a central and demographically uneven failure mode in I2I editing and motivate demographic-robust editing systems.

Accepted at InnovaRail 2026", "summary": "Railway crossings present complex safety challenges where driver behavior varies by location, time, and conditions. Traditional approaches analyze crossings individually, limiting the ability to identify shared behavioral patterns across locations. We propose a multi-view tensor decomposition framework that captures behavioral similarities across three temporal phases: Approach (warning activation to gate lowering), Waiting (gates down to train passage), and Clearance (train passage to gate raising). We analyze railway crossing videos from multiple locations using TimeSformer embeddings to represent each phase. By constructing phase-specific similarity matrices and applying non-negative symmetric CP decomposition, we discover latent behavioral components with distinct temporal signatures. Our tensor analysis reveals that crossing location appears to be a stronger determinant of behavior patterns than time of day, and that approach-phase behavior provides particularly discriminative signatures. Visualization of the learned component space confirms location-based clustering, with certain crossings forming distinct behavioral clusters. This automated framework enables scalable pattern discovery across multiple crossings, providing a foundation for grouping locations by behavioral similarity to inform targeted safety interventions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u94c1\u8def\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u63a5\u8fd1\u3001\u7b49\u5f85\u3001\u6e05\u9664\uff09\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5229\u7528TimeSformer\u5d4c\u5165\u6784\u5efa\u76f8\u4f4d\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u975e\u8d1f\u5bf9\u79f0CP\u5206\u89e3\u53d1\u73b0\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6bd4\u65f6\u95f4\u6bb5\u66f4\u80fd\u51b3\u5b9a\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u63a5\u8fd1\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6700\u5177\u533a\u5206\u6027\u3002\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u663e\u793a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6309\u884c\u4e3a\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5206\u7ec4\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u4ee5\u5236\u5b9a\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5355\u72ec\u5206\u6790\u6bcf\u4e2a\u94c1\u8def\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u8de8\u5730\u70b9\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u95f4\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5171\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528TimeSformer\u5d4c\u5165\u63d0\u53d6\u94c1\u8def\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e09\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u7279\u5b9a\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u8d1f\u5bf9\u79f0CP\u5206\u89e3\u8fdb\u884c\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6316\u6398\u6f5c\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u53ca\u5176\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u4f4d\u7f6e\u662f\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u9636\u6bb5\u884c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u6700\u5f3a\u533a\u5206\u6027\uff1b\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u663e\u793a\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5f62\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6309\u884c\u4e3a\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7ec4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u591a\u4e2a\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u884c\u4e3a\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u5206\u7ec4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5236\u5b9a\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

However, the underlying mechanism behind these gains remains unclear, making it hard to decide when and how to apply the technique effectively. In this work, we argue that the key benefit arises not from the generated examples themselves but from the act of creating them. To validate this, on reasoning-intensive tasks across diverse LLM architectures, we systematically evaluate three prompting strategies for in-context learning: (1) Zero-shot prompting; (2) Integrated prompting, where LLMs create and solve problems within a single, unified prompt; and (3) Decoupled prompting, where self-generated examples are reused as in-context examples, but the context of their creation itself is excluded. We conduct experiments across five widely used model architectures, demonstrating that Integrated prompting consistently outperforms both Zero-shot and Decoupled prompting. In contrast, Decoupled prompting offers only marginal gains over Zero-shot. Further, for a more in-depth analysis, we conduct an attention analysis and observe significant differences in attention patterns between Integrated and Decoupled prompting.

Accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) relies on intracranial EEG (iEEG). Clinical workflows, however, remain constrained by labor-intensive manual review. At the same time, existing data-driven approaches are typically developed on single-center datasets that are inconsistent in format and metadata, lack standardized benchmarks, and rarely release pathological event annotations, creating barriers to reproducibility, cross-center validation, and clinical relevance. With extensive efforts to reconcile heterogeneous iEEG formats, metadata, and recordings across publicly available sources, we present $\\textbf{Omni-iEEG}$, a large-scale, pre-surgical iEEG resource comprising $\\textbf{302 patients}$ and $\\textbf{178 hours}$ of high-resolution recordings. The dataset includes harmonized clinical metadata such as seizure onset zones, resections, and surgical outcomes, all validated by board-certified epileptologists. In addition, Omni-iEEG provides over 36K expert-validated annotations of pathological events, enabling robust biomarker studies. Omni-iEEG serves as a bridge between machine learning and epilepsy research. It defines clinically meaningful tasks with unified evaluation metrics grounded in clinical priors, enabling systematic evaluation of models in clinically relevant settings. Beyond benchmarking, we demonstrate the potential of end-to-end modeling on long iEEG segments and highlight the transferability of representations pretrained on non-neurophysiological domains.

In real-world edge detection (e.g., floor-plan walls, satellite roads/buildings, and medical organ boundaries), crispness and data efficiency are crucial, yet producing crisp raw edge maps with limited training samples remains challenging. Although image-generation foundation models perform well on many downstream tasks, their pretrained priors for data-efficient transfer and iterative refinement for high-frequency detail preservation remain underexploited for edge detection. To enable crisp and data-efficient edge detection using these capabilities, we introduce an edge-specialized adaptation of image-generation foundation models. To better specialize the foundation model for edge detection, we incorporate an edge-oriented objective with an efficient pixel-space loss. At inference, we introduce guidance based on unconditional dynamics, enabling a single model to control the edge density through a guidance scale.

In this work, we argue that two-stream attention may be serving a more subtle role. We identify a structural-semantic tradeoff in any-order generation: the hidden representation at each step must simultaneously attend to semantically informative tokens for prediction and structurally recent tokens for summarization, objectives that compete for attention capacity in a single stream but can specialize across two streams. To isolate this tradeoff from position-content separation, we propose Decoupled RoPE, a modification to rotary position embeddings that provides target position information without revealing target content. Decoupled RoPE performs competitively at short sequence lengths--where semantic and structural proximity coincide--but degrades as sequence length increases and the two orderings diverge. These results suggest that the success of two-stream attention stems not merely from separating position from content, but from circumventing the deeper structural-semantic tradeoff inherent to any-order generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u987a\u5e8f\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff08AO-ARMs\uff09\u4e2d\u4e24\u6d41\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5176\u5e76\u975e\u4ec5\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u79bb\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u8fd1\u671f\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u6743\u8861\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u8026\u5f0f\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\uff08Decoupled RoPE\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u77ed\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e24\u6d41\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u4f18\u52bf\u5728\u4e8e\u7f13\u89e3\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e-\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e24\u6d41\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u610f\u987a\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u5206\u79bb\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u8d28\u7591\u8fd9\u4e00\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u7684\u7ed3\u6784-\u8bed\u4e49\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u8026\u5f0f\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\uff08Decoupled RoPE\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u66b4\u9732\u76ee\u6807\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9694\u79bb\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "Decoupled RoPE\u5728\u77ed\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u4e24\u6d41\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u968f\u7740\u5e8f\u5217\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u504f\u79bb\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u914d\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e24\u6d41\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u6210\u529f\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6e90\u4e8e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\u5b83\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u987a\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6027\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

The game's dialogue-based structure provides a controlled environment for assessing how LLM-based chatbots interpret natural language descriptions and generate appropriate action sequences to succeed in the game. We test the performance of leading proprietary models - ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini - under both minimal and detailed instructions, measuring game progress through achieved scores as the primary metric. Our results reveal that all tested models achieve less than 10% completion on average, with even the best-performing model (Claude Opus 4.5) reaching only approximately 75 out of 350 possible points. Notably, providing detailed game instructions offers no improvement, nor does enabling ''extended thinking''. Qualitative analysis of the models' reasoning processes reveals fundamental limitations: repeated unsuccessful actions suggesting an inability to reflect on one's own thinking, inconsistent persistence of strategies, and failure to learn from previous attempts despite access to conversation history. These findings suggest substantial limitations in current LLMs' metacognitive abilities and problem-solving capabilities within the domain of text-based games, raising questions about the nature and extent of their reasoning capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u6587\u672c\u5192\u9669\u6e38\u620fZork\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u5176\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86ChatGPT\u3001Claude\u548cGemini\u7b49\u4e3b\u6d41\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6307\u4ee4\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u5747\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5b8c\u6210\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db310%\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u4ec5\u8fbe75/350\u5206\u3002\u8be6\u7ec6\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0e\u2018\u6269\u5c55\u601d\u8003\u2019\u529f\u80fd\u672a\u5e26\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u590d\u5931\u8d25\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ece\u5386\u53f2\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u6839\u672c\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0e\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5173\u6ce8\u5176\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0e\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5192\u9669\u6e38\u620fZork\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u591a\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41LLM\uff08ChatGPT\u3001Claude\u3001Gemini\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6700\u5c0f\u4e0e\u8be6\u7ec6\u6307\u4ee4\u4e24\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ee5\u6e38\u620f\u5f97\u5206\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u5b8c\u6210\u5ea6\u4f4e\u4e8e10%\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\uff08Claude Opus 4.5\uff09\u4ec5\u83b7\u5f97\u7ea675\u5206\uff08\u6ee1\u5206350\uff09\u3002\u8be6\u7ec6\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0e\u6269\u5c55\u601d\u8003\u529f\u80fd\u672a\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u91cd\u590d\u9519\u8bef\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ece\u5386\u53f2\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5192\u9669\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0e\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u529b\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53cd\u601d\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u5176\u201c\u667a\u80fd\u201d\u672c\u8d28\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u8fb9\u754c\u3002"}}

Predictive maintenance frameworks increasingly leverage sensor-generated time-series data, yet traditional methods require manual feature engineering, and deep learning models often degrade in online settings with evolving operational patterns. This work presents a semantic-aware, label-efficient continual learning framework for railway fault diagnostics. Accelerometer signals are encoded via a Variational AutoEncoder into latent representations capturing the normal operational structure in a fully unsupervised manner. Importantly, semantic metadata, including axle counts, wheel indexes, and strain-based deformations, is extracted via AI-driven peak detection on fiber Bragg grating sensors (resistant to electromagnetic interference) and fused with the VAE embeddings, enhancing anomaly detection under unknown operational conditions. A lightweight gradient boosting supervised classifier stabilizes anomaly scoring with minimal labels, while a replay-based continual learning strategy enables adaptation to evolving domains without catastrophic forgetting. Experiments show the model detects minor imperfections due to flats and polygonization, while adapting to evolving operational conditions, such as changes in train type, speed, load, and track profiles, captured using a single accelerometer and strain gauge in wayside monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u94c1\u8def\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08VAE\uff09\u5bf9\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u8ba1\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u6b63\u5e38\u8fd0\u884c\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u5cf0\u503c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ece\u5149\u7ea4\u5e03\u62c9\u683c\u5149\u6805\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u8f74\u6570\u3001\u8f6e\u7d22\u5f15\u548c\u5e94\u53d8\u53d8\u5f62\u7b49\u8bed\u4e49\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eVAE\u5d4c\u5165\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u5de5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u6807\u7b7e\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u56de\u653e\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u8f66\u8f6e\u6241\u5e73\u5316\u3001\u591a\u8fb9\u5f62\u5316\u7b49\u5fae\u5c0f\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u5217\u8f66\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u8f7d\u8377\u53ca\u8f68\u9053\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5355\u4e2a\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u8ba1\u548c\u5e94\u53d8\u8ba1\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9053\u65c1\u76d1\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u94c1\u8def\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6613\u53d7\u8fd0\u884c\u6a21\u5f0f\u6f14\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\u800c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u51b5\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08VAE\uff09\u5bf9\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u8ba1\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u6620\u6b63\u5e38\u8fd0\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u5229\u7528AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5cf0\u503c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u4ece\u5149\u7ea4\u5e03\u62c9\u683c\u5149\u6805\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u8f74\u6570\u3001\u8f6e\u7d22\u5f15\u548c\u5e94\u53d8\u53d8\u5f62\u7b49\u8bed\u4e49\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5143\u6570\u636e\u4e0eVAE\u5d4c\u5165\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u56de\u653e\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u65b0\u8fd0\u884c\u57df\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u8f66\u8f6e\u6241\u5e73\u5316\u3001\u591a\u8fb9\u5f62\u5316\u7b49\u5fae\u5c0f\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5728\u5217\u8f66\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u8f7d\u8377\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u5b8c\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u94c1\u8def\u8f6e\u8f68\u754c\u9762\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4e14\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u7684\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

We propose a formalisation of LLM interaction using a deterministic multi-tape Turing machine, where each tape represents a distinct component: input characters, tokens, vocabulary, model parameters, activations, probability distributions, and output text. The model enables precise localisation of failure modes to specific pipeline stages, revealing, e.g., how tokenisation obscures character-level structure needed for counting tasks. The model clarifies why techniques like chain-of-thought prompting help, by externalising computation on the output tape, while also revealing their fundamental limitations. This approach provides a rigorous, falsifiable alternative to geometric metaphors and complements empirical scaling laws with principled error analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u591a\u5e26\u56fe\u7075\u673a\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u8f93\u5165\u5b57\u7b26\u3001\u6807\u8bb0\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7b49\uff09\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u78c1\u5e26\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5206\u8bcd\u5982\u4f55\u63a9\u76d6\u8ba1\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u63d0\u793a\u4e3a\u4f55\u6709\u6548\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8f93\u51fa\u78c1\u5e26\u4e0a\u5916\u90e8\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5176\u6839\u672c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u9690\u55bb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u770b\u4f3c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6bd4\u55bb\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u5e26\u56fe\u7075\u673a\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5904\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u5982\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u5206\u8bcd\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u6fc0\u6d3b\u3001\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u8f93\u51fa\uff09\u5206\u522b\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u78c1\u5e26\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e86\u5206\u8bcd\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u5b57\u7b26\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7834\u574f\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u68c0\u9a8c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7c7b\u6bd4\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u4e0e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\u4e92\u8865\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u591a\u5e26\u56fe\u7075\u673a\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e25\u8c28\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u5185\u5728\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u8c03\u8bd5\u3002"}}

Masked Autoencoders (MAE) reduce computation by encoding only visible tokens, but combining MAE with hierarchical downsampling architectures remains structurally challenging due to dense grid priors and mask-aware design compromises. We introduce AFFMAE, a masking-friendly hierarchical pretraining framework built on adaptive, off-grid token merging. By discarding masked tokens and performing dynamic merging exclusively over visible tokens, AFFMAE removes dense-grid assumptions while preserving hierarchical scalability. We developed numerically stable mixed-precision Flash-style cluster attention kernels, and mitigate sparse-stage representation collapse via deep supervision. On high-resolution electron microscopy segmentation, AFFMAE matches ViT-MAE performance at equal parameter count while reducing FLOPs by up to 7x, halving memory usage, and achieving faster training on a single RTX 5090.

However, previous work has not examined their generalizability between formats, cultures, and genders. In this work, we systematically evaluate fine-tuned transformer models (BERT, ClinicalBERT, ModernBERT), small LLMs (Llama 1-8B, Qwen 1.5-7B), and large LLMs (Llama-70B, Qwen-72B) at de-identification. We show that smaller models achieve comparable performance while substantially reducing inference cost, making them more practical for deployment. Moreover, we demonstrate that smaller models can be fine-tuned with limited data to outperform larger models in de-identifying identifiers drawn from Mandarin, Hindi, Spanish, French, Bengali, and regional variations of English, in addition to gendered names. To improve robustness in multi-cultural contexts, we introduce and publicly release BERT-MultiCulture-DEID, a set of de-identification models based on BERT, ClinicalBERT, and ModernBERT, fine-tuned on MIMIC with identifiers from multiple language variants. Our findings provide the first comprehensive quantification of the efficiency-generalizability trade-off in de-identification and establish practical pathways for fair and efficient clinical de-identification.\n  Details on accessing the models are available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18342291", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u53bb\u6807\u8bc6\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u5373\u53ef\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u53ca\u6027\u522b\u5316\u59d3\u540d\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8d85\u8d8a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eBERT\u3001ClinicalBERT\u548cModernBERT\u7684\u591a\u6587\u5316\u53bb\u6807\u8bc6\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u96c6 BERT-MultiCulture-DEID\uff0c\u4e3a\u516c\u5e73\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8003\u5bdf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u683c\u5f0f\u3001\u6587\u5316\u548c\u6027\u522b\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u53bb\u6807\u8bc6\u5316\u6280\u672f\u843d\u5730\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86BERT\u3001ClinicalBERT\u3001ModernBERT\u7b49\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u53caLlama\u7cfb\u5217\u548cQwen\u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u5927\u4e2d\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53bb\u6807\u8bc6\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5305\u542b\u4e2d\u6587\u3001\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u3001\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\u3001\u6cd5\u8bed\u3001\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u53ca\u82f1\u8bed\u533a\u57df\u53d8\u4f53\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6027\u522b\u5316\u59d3\u540d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u5e76\u516c\u5f00\u53d1\u5e03BERT-MultiCulture-DEID\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6587\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u53bb\u6807\u8bc6\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff1b\u7ecf\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\uff0c\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u53ca\u6027\u522b\u5316\u59d3\u540d\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u6240\u53d1\u5e03\u7684BERT-MultiCulture-DEID\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6587\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5168\u9762\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u53bb\u6807\u8bc6\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5408\u7406\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u6027\u4ef7\u6bd4\u4e0e\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Traditional frame tracers rely on mechanical tools that need precise positioning and calibration, which are time-consuming and require additional equipment, creating an inefficient workflow for opticians. This work presents a novel approach based on artificial vision that utilizes multi-view information. The proposed algorithm operates on images captured from an InVision system. The full pipeline includes image acquisition, frame segmentation to isolate the eyeframe from background, depth estimation to obtain 3D spatial information, and multi-view processing that integrates segmented RGB images with depth data for precise frame contour measurement. To this end, different configurations and variants are proposed and analyzed on real data, providing competitive measurements from still color images with respect to other solutions, while eliminating the need for specialized tracing equipment and reducing workflow complexity for optical technicians.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u773c\u6846\u8f6e\u5ed3\u8ffd\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u4fe1\u606f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e9a\u6beb\u7c73\u7ea7\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u773c\u955c\u6846\u8f6e\u5ed3\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u91c7\u96c6\u3001\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u5272\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u878d\u5408\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u4e13\u7528\u8bbe\u5907\u3001\u7b80\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5149\u5b66\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u68b0\u5f0f\u8ffd\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u773c\u6846\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4f9d\u8d56\u673a\u68b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u9700\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u4f4d\u4e0e\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9a8c\u5149\u5e08\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4f4e\u6548\u3002\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4e13\u7528\u8bbe\u5907\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528InVision\u7cfb\u7edf\u83b7\u53d6\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5f69\u8272\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u91c7\u96c6\u3001\u773c\u6846\u533a\u57df\u5206\u5272\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u53ca\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u914d\u7f6e\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u8f6e\u5ed3\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u9759\u6001\u5f69\u8272\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u4e13\u4e1a\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u9a8c\u5149\u5e08\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u773c\u6846\u8f6e\u5ed3\u8ffd\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u68b0\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u6613\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b49\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u5149\u5b66\u884c\u4e1a\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6548\u7cbe\u51c6\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Most existing work includes all related data sources via simultaneously training a common feature extractor and source-specific heads. It is well understood that data sources with low relevance or poor quality may hinder representation learning. In this paper, we further dive into the question of which data sources should be learned jointly by focusing on the traditionally deemed ``good'' collection of sources, in which individual sources have similar relevance and qualities with respect to the true underlying common structure. Towards tractability, we focus on the linear setting where sources share a low-dimensional subspace. We find that source screening can play a central role in statistically optimal subspace estimation. We show that, for a broad class of problem instances, training on a carefully selected subset of sources suffices to achieve minimax optimality, even when a substantial portion of data is discarded. We formalize the notion of an informative subpopulation, develop algorithms and practical heuristics for identifying such subsets, and validate their effectiveness through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u5206\u79bb\u5171\u6027\u4e0e\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba4\u4e3a\u201c\u826f\u597d\u201d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u96c6\u5408\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b5b\u9009\u5173\u952e\u5b50\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u7cbe\u5fc3\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u5b50\u96c6\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4e22\u5f03\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u2018\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u2019\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u6b64\u7c7b\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u540c\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6240\u6709\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u7684\u516c\u5171\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u5934\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4f46\u4f4e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6216\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u53ef\u80fd\u963b\u788d\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5173\u6ce8\u5728\u770b\u4f3c\u201c\u826f\u597d\u201d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b50\u96c6\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7ebf\u6027\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6e90\u7b5b\u9009\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u2018\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u2019\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u95ee\u9898\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u7ecf\u8fc7\u7b5b\u9009\u7684\u5b50\u96c6\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5168\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6e90\u7b5b\u9009\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6838\u5fc3\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5408\u7406\u9009\u62e9\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u591a\u6e90\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

We propose \\textbf{VDLM}, a modular variable diffusion language model that separates semantic planning from text rendering. VDLM applies LLaDA-style masked diffusion over semantic variable embeddings to enable iterative refinement in latent space, then post-trains the planner with trajectory-aware optimization using embedding-space rewards and values, avoiding text decoding inside the RL loop. To convert planned embeddings back to text, we use a \\textbf{Vec2Text} renderer and introduce \\textbf{embedding perturbations} to robustify decoding under planner noise. Across nine benchmarks spanning general reasoning, math, and code, VDLM is competitive in pre-training and yields substantial post-training improvements on long-form generation tasks, outperforming other baselines.

Addressing complex problems like object detection demands considerable time and resources for data labeling to achieve meaningful results. For companies developing such applications, this entails extensive investment in highly skilled personnel or costly outsourcing. This research work aims to demonstrate that enhancing feature extractors can substantially alleviate this challenge, enabling models to learn more effective representations with less labeled data. Utilizing a self-supervised learning strategy, we present a model trained on unlabeled data that outperforms state-of-the-art feature extractors pre-trained on ImageNet and particularly designed for object detection tasks. Moreover, the results demonstrate that our approach encourages the model to focus on the most relevant aspects of an object, thus achieving better feature representations and, therefore, reinforcing its reliability and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eImageNet\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ca\u4e13\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u800c\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u8017\u65f6\u8017\u529b\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5177\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u7269\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff08\u5305\u62ecImageNet\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u4e13\u4e3a\u5bf9\u8c61\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u96be\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We investigate whether spectral representations offer more stable features for cross-subject transfer than temporal waveforms. Through correlation analyses across three EEG paradigms (SSVEP, P300, and Motor Imagery), we find that spectral features exhibit consistently higher cross-subject similarity than temporal signals. Motivated by this observation, we introduce ASPEN, a hybrid architecture that combines spectral and temporal feature streams via multiplicative fusion, requiring cross-modal agreement for features to propagate. Experiments across six benchmark datasets reveal that ASPEN is able to dynamically achieve the optimal spectral-temporal balance depending on the paradigm. ASPEN achieves the best unseen-subject accuracy on three of six datasets and competitive performance on others, demonstrating that multiplicative multimodal fusion enables effective cross-subject generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u8111\u7535\u7684\u8111\u673a\u63a5\u53e3\uff08BCI\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u9891\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u662f\u5426\u6bd4\u65f6\u57df\u6ce2\u5f62\u66f4\u5177\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\uff08SSVEP\u3001P300\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u60f3\u8c61\uff09\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u9891\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u95f4\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002\u53d7\u6b64\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51faASPEN\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u9891\u8c31\u4e0e\u65f6\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u6d41\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e58\u6cd5\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u624d\u80fd\u4f20\u64ad\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cASPEN\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u8303\u5f0f\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u9891\u8c31\u4e0e\u65f6\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u672a\u89c1\u88ab\u8bd5\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5176\u4f59\u8868\u73b0\u4e5f\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e58\u6cd5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "EEG-based BCI\u4e2d\u7684\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u6cdb\u5316\u56e0\u4e2a\u4f53\u795e\u7ecf\u4fe1\u53f7\u5dee\u5f02\u800c\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e2a\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9891\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u662f\u5426\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u65f6\u57df\u6ce2\u5f62\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faASPEN\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u67b6\u6784\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53d6\u9891\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u65f6\u57df\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e58\u6cd5\u878d\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b\u4ec5\u5f53\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u624d\u5f97\u4ee5\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cASPEN\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u672a\u89c1\u88ab\u8bd5\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5176\u4f59\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8868\u73b0\u4e5f\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u8303\u5f0f\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u9891\u8c31\u4e0e\u65f6\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9891\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u6bd4\u65f6\u57df\u6ce2\u5f62\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e58\u6cd5\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4f7fASPEN\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u4e2a\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this constraint by retrieving external knowledge during inference, though it still depends heavily on knowledge base quality. To explore potential improvements, we evaluated three RAG variants-Standard RAG, DA-RAG, and our proposed Prompt-Enhanced Parametric RAG (P-RAG), a hybrid architecture that integrates parametric knowledge within the LLM and retrieved evidence, guided by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning-on both general and biomedical datasets. Using LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct fine-tuned via LoRA, we evaluate on PubMedQA and 2WikiMultihopQA. P-RAG outperforms Standard RAG on PubMedQA by 10.47 percentage points in F1 (93.33% vs. 82.86%; 12.64% relative). On 2WikiMultihopQA, P-RAG nearly doubles the overall score vs. Standard RAG (33.44% vs. 17.83%) and achieves 44.03% on the Compare subset (with 42.74% Bridge, 21.84% Inference, 8.60% Compose).

SCAR estimates both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters by aligning aerial images with 2D--3D correspondences derived from publicly available orthophotos and elevation models. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on dedicated calibration maneuvers or manually surveyed ground control points, our method leverages external geospatial data to detect and correct calibration degradation under field deployment conditions. We evaluate our approach on six large-scale aerial campaigns conducted over two years under diverse seasonal and environmental conditions. Across all sequences, SCAR consistently outperforms established baselines (Kalibr, COLMAP, VINS-Mono), reducing median reprojection error by a large margin, and translating these calibration gains into substantially lower visual localization rotation errors and higher pose accuracy. These results demonstrate that SCAR provides accurate, robust, and reproducible calibration over long-term aerial operations without the need for manual intervention.", "AI": {"tldr": "SCAR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u957f\u671f\u81ea\u52a8\u6821\u51c6\u4f18\u5316\u822a\u7a7a\u89c6\u89c9-\u60ef\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5730\u7406\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6301\u4e45\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u53c2\u8003\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u822a\u7a7a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u6765\u81ea\u516c\u5f00\u6b63\u5c04\u5f71\u50cf\u548c\u9ad8\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u76842D-3D\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u5185\u5728\u548c\u5916\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u4e0e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u7528\u6821\u51c6\u64cd\u4f5c\u6216\u4eba\u5de5\u6d4b\u91cf\u5730\u9762\u63a7\u5236\u70b9\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cSCAR\u5229\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u7ea0\u6b63\u73b0\u573a\u90e8\u7f72\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u9000\u5316\u3002\u5728\u4e24\u5e74\u5185\u516d\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u822a\u7a7a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSCAR\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08Kalibr\u3001COLMAP\u3001VINS-Mono\uff09\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u4e2d\u503c\u91cd\u6295\u5f71\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65cb\u8f6c\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4f4d\u59ff\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e13\u7528\u6821\u51c6\u64cd\u4f5c\u6216\u4eba\u5de5\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5730\u9762\u63a7\u5236\u70b9\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u957f\u671f\u91ce\u5916\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u786e\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u3001\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u5730\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u671f\u81ea\u52a8\u6821\u51c6\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "SCAR\u5229\u7528\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u6b63\u5c04\u5f71\u50cf\u548c\u9ad8\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u62102D-3D\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5339\u914d\u822a\u7a7a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u5730\u7406\u53c2\u8003\u6570\u636e\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u89c6\u89c9-\u60ef\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5185\u5728\u548c\u5916\u5728\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u671f\u81ea\u52a8\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u6b21\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u822a\u7a7a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSCAR\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e2d\u503c\u91cd\u6295\u5f71\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u4f4d\u59ff\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eKalibr\u3001COLMAP\u548cVINS-Mono\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "conclusion": "SCAR\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u957f\u671f\u822a\u7a7a\u89c6\u89c9-\u60ef\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u591a\u53d8\u7684\u91ce\u5916\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

distribution shifts, group imbalances, and adversarial perturbations, under which the traditional Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) framework can degrade severely.\n  Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) addresses this issue by optimizing the worst-case expected loss over an uncertainty set of distributions, offering a principled approach to robustness.\n  Meanwhile, as training data in DRO always involves sensitive information, safeguarding it against leakage under Differential Privacy (DP) is essential.\n  In contrast to classical DP-ERM, DP-DRO has received much less attention due to its minimax optimization structure with uncertainty constraint.\n  To bridge the gap, we provide a comprehensive study of DP-(finite-sum)-DRO with $\u03c8$-divergence and non-convex loss.\n  First, we study DRO with general $\u03c8$-divergence by reformulating it as a minimization problem, and develop a novel $(\\varepsilon, \u03b4)$-DP optimization method, called DP Double-Spider, tailored to this structure.\n  Under mild assumptions, we show that it achieves a utility bound of $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}+ (\\frac{\\sqrt{d \\log (1/\u03b4)}}{n \\varepsilon})^{2/3})$ in terms of the gradient norm, where $n$ denotes the data size and $d$ denotes the model dimension.\n  We further improve the utility rate for specific divergences.\n  In particular, for DP-DRO with KL-divergence, by transforming the problem into a compositional finite-sum optimization problem, we develop a DP Recursive-Spider method and show that it achieves a utility bound of $\\mathcal{O}((\\frac{\\sqrt{d \\log(1/\u03b4)}}{n\\varepsilon})^{2/3} )$, matching the best-known result for non-convex DP-ERM.\n  Experimentally, we demonstrate that our proposed methods

Although some methods have been proposed to enhance LLM output diversity, they often come at the cost of reduced performance. In this work, we first theoretically demonstrate that the alignment task can be decomposed into two distributions: quality and diversity. To enhance the diversity of LLM outputs while ensuring quality, we propose the Quality-constrained Entropy Maximization Policy Optimization (QEMPO). QEMPO aims to maximize the output entropy of the policy while ensuring output quality. By adding different constraints to QEMPO, we obtain different policies. To optimize policies, we propose both online and offline training methods.

However, existing monocular SSC approaches often lack explicit modeling of voxel-feature reliability and regulated cross-scale information propagation during 2D-3D projection and multi-scale fusion, making them vulnerable to projection diffusion and feature entanglement and thus limiting structural stability.To address these challenges, this paper presents an Adaptive Multi-scale Attention Aggregation (AMAA) framework built upon the MonoScene pipeline. Rather than introducing a heavier backbone, AMAA focuses on reliability-oriented feature regulation within a monocular SSC framework. Specifically, lifted voxel features are jointly calibrated in semantic and spatial dimensions through parallel channel-spatial attention aggregation, while multi-scale encoder-decoder fusion is stabilized via a hierarchical adaptive feature-gating strategy that regulates information injection across scales.Experiments on the NYUv2 benchmark demonstrate consistent improvements over MonoScene without significantly increasing system complexity: AMAA achieves 27.25% SSC mIoU (+0.31) and 43.10% SC IoU (+0.59). In addition, system-level deployment on an NVIDIA Jetson platform verifies that the complete AMAA framework can be executed stably on embedded hardware. Overall, AMAA improves monocular SSC quality and provides a reliable and deployable perception framework for indoor assistive systems targeting visually impaired users.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eMonoScene\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u805a\u5408\uff08AMAA\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5355\u76ee3D\u8bed\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u8865\u5168\uff08SSC\uff09\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u969c\u788d\u8005\u5ba4\u5185\u8f85\u52a9\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u7684\u901a\u9053-\u7a7a\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u805a\u5408\u6821\u51c6\u4f53\u7d20\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5f81\u95e8\u63a7\u7b56\u7565\u7a33\u5b9a\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u6295\u5f71\u6269\u6563\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u7ea0\u7f20\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5728NYUv2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cAMAA\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8627.25%\u7684SSC mIoU\uff08+0.31\uff09\u548c43.10%\u7684SC IoU\uff08+0.59\uff09\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u4e14\u5728NVIDIA Jetson\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u7a33\u5b9a\u90e8\u7f72\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u969c\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u76ee3D\u8bed\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u8865\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4f53\u7d20\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u4ee5\u53ca\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6295\u5f71\u6269\u6563\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7ed3\u6784\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u805a\u5408\uff08AMAA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u901a\u9053-\u7a7a\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u805a\u5408\u8054\u5408\u6821\u51c6\u4f53\u7d20\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5f81\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u7a33\u5b9a\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u878d\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8c03\u8282\u3002", "result": "\u5728NYUv2\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAMAA\u76f8\u6bd4MonoScene\u5728SSC mIoU\u4e0a\u63d0\u53470.31\uff08\u8fbe27.25%\uff09\uff0c\u5728SC IoU\u4e0a\u63d0\u53470.59\uff08\u8fbe43.10%\uff09\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5728NVIDIA Jetson\u5e73\u53f0\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u4e0e\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AMAA\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5355\u76ee3D\u8bed\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u8865\u5168\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9762\u5411\u89c6\u969c\u7528\u6237\u7684\u5ba4\u5185\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

However, the inherent discrete representation of text in existing frameworks often results in a loss of semantic integrity, leading to retrieval deviations. Inspired by the human episodic memory mechanism, we propose CogitoRAG, a RAG framework that simulates human cognitive memory processes. The core of this framework lies in the extraction and evolution of the Semantic Gist. During the offline indexing stage, CogitoRAG first deduces unstructured corpora into gist memory corpora, which are then transformed into a multi-dimensional knowledge graph integrating entities, relational facts, and memory nodes. In the online retrieval stage, the framework handles complex queries via Query Decomposition Module that breaks them into comprehensive sub-queries, mimicking the cognitive decomposition humans employ for complex information. Subsequently, Entity Diffusion Module performs associative retrieval across the graph, guided by structural relevance and an entity-frequency reward mechanism. Furthermore, we propose the CogniRank algorithm, which precisely reranks candidate passages by fusing diffusion-derived scores with semantic similarity. The final evidence is delivered to the generator in a passage-memory pairing format, providing high-density information support.

Most existing works are designed for a transductive setting, which learns dataset-specific embeddings and struggles to generalize to new KGs. Recent knowledge graph foundation models (KGFMs) improve cross-KG transfer, but they mainly exploit structural patterns and ignore rich multi-modal signals. We address these gaps by proposing a token-based foundation model (TOFU) for MMKGR, which exhibits strong generalization across different MMKGs. TOFU discretizes structural, visual, and textual information into modality-specific tokens. TOFU then employs a hierarchical fusion architecture with mixture-of-message mechanisms, aiming to process these tokens and obtain transferable features for MMKGR. Experimental results on 17 transductive, inductive, and fully-inductive MMKGs show that TOFU consistently outperforms strong KGFM and MMKGR baselines, delivering strong performance on unseen MMKGs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578bTOFU\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u6d88\u606f\u6df7\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u572817\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTOFU\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff1b\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fd1\u671f\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8de8\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "TOFU\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u6d88\u606f\u6df7\u5408\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ee4\u724c\u8fdb\u884c\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u572817\u4e2a\u8f6c\u5bfc\u3001\u5f52\u7eb3\u53ca\u5b8c\u5168\u5f52\u7eb3\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e0a\uff0cTOFU consistently \u8d85\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u7684KGFM\u548cMMKGR\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "TOFU\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u8de8\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) and their remasking samplers (e.g., ReMDM) can be viewed as modern NAR iterative refinement, where generation repeatedly revises a partially observed draft. In this work we show that \\emph{training alone} can substantially improve the step-efficiency of MDLM/ReMDM sampling.

Existing defenses mainly employ gradient perturbation techniques, e.g., noise injection or gradient pruning, to disrupt GIAs' direct mapping from gradient space to token space. However, these methods often fall short due to the retention of semantics similarity across gradient, embedding, and token spaces. In this work, we propose a novel defense mechanism named GHOST (gradient shield with obfuscated tokens), a token-level obfuscation mechanism that neutralizes GIAs by decoupling the inherent connections across gradient, embedding, and token spaces. GHOST is built upon an important insight: due to the large scale of the token space, there exist semantically distinct yet embedding-proximate tokens that can serve as the shadow substitutes of the original tokens, which enables a semantic disconnection in the token space while preserving the connection in the embedding and gradient spaces. GHOST comprises a searching step, which identifies semantically distinct candidate tokens using a multi-criteria searching process, and a selection step, which selects optimal shadow tokens to ensure minimal disruption to features critical for training by preserving alignment with the internal outputs produced by original tokens. Evaluation across diverse model architectures (from BERT to Llama) and datasets demonstrates the remarkable effectiveness of GHOST in protecting privacy (as low as 1% in recovery rate) and preserving utility (up to 0.92 in classification F1 and 5.45 in perplexity), in both classification and generation tasks against state-of-the-art GIAs and adaptive attack scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "GHOST\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u6df7\u6dc6\u6765\u5207\u65ad\u68af\u5ea6\u3001\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u4ee4\u724c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6709\u6548\u62b5\u5fa1\u68af\u5ea6\u53cd\u6f14\u653b\u51fb\uff08GIA\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u566a\u58f0\u6ce8\u5165\u6216\u68af\u5ea6\u526a\u679d\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u6253\u7834\u68af\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u5230\u4ee4\u724c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6620\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\u4f9d\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGHOST\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\u4e24\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a\u641c\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u51c6\u5219\u7b5b\u9009\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u540c\u4f46\u5d4c\u5165\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u5019\u9009\u4ee4\u724c\uff1b\u9009\u62e9\u9636\u6bb5\u9009\u53d6\u6700\u4f18\u5f71\u5b50\u4ee4\u724c\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u65ad\u8fde\u800c\u4fdd\u7559\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u8fde\u63a5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u4eceBERT\u5230Llama\uff09\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cGHOST\u80fd\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u6062\u590d\u7387\u964d\u81f31%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8fbe0.92\u7684F1\u503c\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7ef4\u63015.45\u7684\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u53cd\u6f14\u653b\u51fb\u53ca\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "GHOST\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4ee4\u724c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u65ad\u8fde\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u68af\u5ea6\u53cd\u6f14\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u4f5c\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing models often struggle with visually dense charts, leading to errors like data omission, misalignment, and hallucination. Inspired by the human strategy of using a finger as a ``visual anchor'' to ensure accuracy when reading complex charts, we propose a new paradigm named Visual Self-Refine (VSR). The core idea of VSR is to enable a model to generate pixel-level localization outputs, visualize them, and then feed these visualizations back to itself, allowing it to intuitively inspect and correct its own potential visual perception errors. We instantiate the VSR paradigm in the domain of Chart Parsing by proposing ChartVSR. This model decomposes the parsing process into two stages: a Refine Stage, where it iteratively uses visual feedback to ensure the accuracy of all data points' Pixel-level Localizations, and a Decode Stage, where it uses these verified localizations as precise visual anchors to parse the final structured data. To address the limitations of existing benchmarks, we also construct ChartP-Bench, a new and highly challenging benchmark for chart parsing.

Traditional centralized machine learning approaches for theft detection require aggregating user data, raising serious concerns about privacy and data security. These issues are further exacerbated in smart meter environments, where devices are often resource-constrained and lack the capacity to run heavy models. In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving federated learning framework for energy theft detection that addresses both privacy and computational constraints. Our approach leverages a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) model, suitable for deployment on low-power smart meters, and integrates basic differential privacy (DP) by injecting Gaussian noise into local model updates before aggregation. This ensures formal privacy guarantees without compromising learning performance. We evaluate our framework on a real-world smart meter dataset under both IID and non-IID data distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC scores while maintaining privacy and efficiency. This makes the proposed solution practical and scalable for secure energy theft detection in next-generation smart grid infrastructures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\u4e2d\u7684\u7a83\u7535\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\uff08MLP\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5728\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u8868\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u672c\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff08DP\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6b63\u5f0f\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u969c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u8868\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6IID\u548c\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548cAUC\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u9690\u79c1\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7a83\u7535\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u805a\u5408\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u8868\u8bbe\u5907\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8fd0\u884c\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u53c8\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7a83\u7535\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\uff08MLP\uff09\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u518d\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5c40\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u8868\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5728IID\u8fd8\u662f\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548cAUC\u503c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\u4e2d\u7a83\u7535\u68c0\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u662f\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods struggle to capture these structural semantics accurately, resulting in suboptimal performance. Graph-based RAGs structure such information in graphs, but the resulting graphs are often noisy and computationally expensive. Moreover, most methods rely on single-step retrieval, neglecting the need for multi-hop reasoning processes. Recent training-based approaches attempt to incentivize the large language models (LLMs) for iterative reasoning and retrieval, but their training processes are prone to unstable convergence and high computational overhead. To address these limitations, we devise an ontology-based cube structure with multiple and orthogonal dimensions to model structural subjects, attributes, and relations. Built on the cube structure, we propose MultiCube-RAG, a training-free method consisting of multiple cubes for multi-step reasoning and retrieval. Each cube specializes in modeling a class of subjects, so that MultiCube-RAG flexibly selects the most suitable cubes to acquire the relevant knowledge precisely. To enhance the query-based reasoning and retrieval, our method decomposes a complex multi-hop query into a set of simple subqueries along cube dimensions and conquers each of them sequentially. Experiments on four multi-hop QA datasets show that MultiCube-RAG improves response accuracy by 8.9% over the average performance of various baselines. Notably, we also demonstrate that our method performs with greater efficiency and inherent explainability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMultiCube-RAG\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u4f53\u7684\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3b\u4f53\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u6b63\u4ea4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\uff0c\u7075\u6d3b\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\u9010\u4e2a\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53478.9%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u56fe\u57faRAG\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u6b65\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u9700\u6c42\uff1b\u800c\u8bad\u7ec3\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53c8\u9762\u4e34\u6536\u655b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u4f53\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3b\u4f53\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0e\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u63d0\u51faMultiCube-RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2a\u4e13\u7528\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\uff1b\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u6cbf\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u6309\u5e8f\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMultiCube-RAG\u76f8\u6bd4\u5404\u7c7b\u57fa\u7ebf\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53478.9%\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5185\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MultiCube-RAG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Despite recent advances in visual document understanding, the fundamental task of document packet splitting, which involves separating a document packet into individual units, remains largely unaddressed. We present the first comprehensive benchmark dataset, DocSplit, along with novel evaluation metrics for assessing the document packet splitting capabilities of large language models. DocSplit comprises five datasets of varying complexity, covering diverse document types, layouts, and multimodal settings. We formalize the DocSplit task, which requires models to identify document boundaries, classify document types, and maintain correct page ordering within a document packet. The benchmark addresses real-world challenges, including out-of-order pages, interleaved documents, and documents lacking clear demarcations. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating multimodal LLMs on our datasets, revealing significant performance gaps in current models' ability to handle complex document splitting tasks. The DocSplit benchmark datasets and proposed novel evaluation metrics provide a systematic framework for advancing document understanding capabilities essential for legal, financial, healthcare, and other document-intensive domains.

However, existing feed-forward methods struggle with diverse poses and viewpoints, while optimization-based approaches are computationally expensive and difficult to scale. This paper focuses on sewing pattern generation for garment modeling and fabrication applications that demand editable, separable, and simulation-ready garments. We propose DressWild, a novel feed-forward pipeline that reconstructs physics-consistent 2D sewing patterns and the corresponding 3D garments from a single in-the-wild image. Given an input image, our method leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to normalize pose variations at the image level, then extract pose-aware, 3D-informed garment features. These features are fused through a transformer-based encoder and subsequently used to predict sewing pattern parameters, which can be directly applied to physical simulation, texture synthesis, and multi-layer virtual try-on. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach robustly recovers diverse sewing patterns and the corresponding 3D garments from in-the-wild images without requiring multi-view inputs or iterative optimization, offering an efficient and scalable solution for realistic garment simulation and animation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDressWild\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u524d\u9988\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u76842D\u7f1d\u5236\u56fe\u6848\u53ca\u5bf9\u5e94\u76843D\u670d\u88c5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5c42\u9762\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u59ff\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6\u59ff\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u30013D\u4fe1\u606f\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u670d\u88c5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u878d\u5408\u540e\u9884\u6d4b\u7f1d\u5236\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u5408\u6210\u548c\u591a\u5c42\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u7a7f\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8f93\u5165\u6216\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5730\u6062\u590d\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u7f1d\u5236\u56fe\u6848\u4e0e3D\u670d\u88c5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u670d\u88c5\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u52a8\u753b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u524d\u9988\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6837\u5316\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u4e3a\u6ee1\u8db3\u670d\u88c5\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u5236\u9020\u4e2d\u5bf9\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u3001\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u3001\u53ef\u6a21\u62df\u670d\u88c5\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u59ff\u6001\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u53d6\u59ff\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u30013D\u4fe1\u606f\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u670d\u88c5\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u878d\u5408\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u9884\u6d4b\u7f1d\u5236\u56fe\u6848\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u591a\u5c42\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u7a7f\u3002", "result": "DressWild\u80fd\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u91cd\u5efa\u591a\u6837\u5316\u76842D\u7f1d\u5236\u56fe\u6848\u4e0e3D\u670d\u88c5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8f93\u5165\u6216\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DressWild\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u524d\u9988\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u53ef\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u76842D\u7f1d\u5236\u56fe\u6848\u4e0e3D\u670d\u88c5\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u670d\u88c5\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u7a7f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

As tasks and definitions evolve, such models cannot accommodate emerging distinctions and collecting new annotations and retraining to accommodate such changes is costly. To address these challenges, we introduce category splitting, a new task where an existing classifier is edited to refine a coarse category into finer subcategories, while preserving accuracy elsewhere. We propose a zero-shot editing method that leverages the latent compositional structure of video classifiers to expose fine-grained distinctions without additional data. We further show that low-shot fine-tuning, while simple, is highly effective and benefits from our zero-shot initialization. Experiments on our new video benchmarks for category splitting demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms vision-language baselines, improving accuracy on the newly split categories without sacrificing performance on the rest.

This paper presents ModalImmune, a training framework that enforces modality immunity by intentionally and controllably collapsing selected modality information during training so the model learns joint representations that are robust to destructive modality influence. The framework combines a spectrum-adaptive collapse regularizer, an information-gain guided controller for targeted interventions, curvature-aware gradient masking to stabilize destructive updates, and a certified Neumann-truncated hyper-gradient procedure for automatic meta-parameter adaptation.

Recent token-ranking heuristics accelerate inference by selectively processing a subset of semantically relevant tokens. However, existing methods suffer from unstable token importance estimation, often varying between layers. Evaluating token-ranking quality independently from heuristic-specific architectures is challenging. To address this, we introduce an Answer-Informed Oracle, which defines ground-truth token importance by measuring attention from generated answers back to the prompt. This oracle reveals that existing heuristics exhibit high variance across layers: rankings can degrade sharply at specific layers, a failure mode invisible to end-to-end benchmarks. The diagnosis suggests a simple fix: aggregate scores across layers rather than relying on any single one. We implement this as Cross-Layer Attention Aggregation (CLAA), which closes the gap to the oracle upper bound and reduces Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by up to 39\\% compared to the Full KV Cache baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAnswer-Informed Oracle\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9a\u4e49\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u751f\u6210\u7b54\u6848\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u771f\u5b9e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u5c42\u7684\u5f97\u5206\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u8de8\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u805a\u5408\uff08CLAA\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u591a\u5c42\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u9996\u6b21\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\uff08TTFT\uff09\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe39%\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u9884\u586b\u5145\u9636\u6bb5\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee4\u724c\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u5c42\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bca\u65ad\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Answer-Informed Oracle\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u7b54\u6848\u56de\u6eaf\u5230\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u4f5c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6807\u7b7e\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u95f4\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6ce2\u52a8\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u8de8\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u805a\u5408\uff08CLAA\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u591a\u5c42\u5f97\u5206\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "CLAA\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a5\u8fd1Oracle\u4e0a\u754c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5168\u952e\u503c\u7f13\u5b58\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\uff08TTFT\uff09\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c1139%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b54\u6848\u56de\u6eaf\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8de8\u5c42\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u73b0\u6709\u4ee4\u724c\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c42\u95f4\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

These attacks exploit a critical vulnerability in passport enrollment procedures adopted by many countries, where the facial image is often acquired without a supervised live capture process. In this paper, we propose a novel face morphing technique based on Arc2Face, an identity-conditioned face foundation model capable of synthesizing photorealistic facial images from compact identity representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by comparing the morphing attack potential metric on two large-scale sequestered face morphing attack detection datasets against several state-of-the-art morphing methods, as well as on two novel morphed face datasets derived from FEI and ONOT. Experimental results show that the proposed deep learning-based approach achieves a morphing attack potential comparable to that of landmark-based techniques, which have traditionally been regarded as the most challenging. These findings confirm the ability of the proposed method to effectively preserve and manage identity information during the morph generation process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eArc2Face\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u4eba\u8138\u878d\u5408\u653b\u51fb\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u5229\u7528\u8eab\u4efd\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u4eba\u8138\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9694\u79bb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u70b9\u7684\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u8138\u878d\u5408\u653b\u51fb\u662f\u7535\u5b50\u8eab\u4efd\u6587\u4ef6\u4e2d\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u56fd\u5bb6\u62a4\u7167\u6ce8\u518c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53d7\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u73af\u8282\u65f6\u66f4\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b0\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u624b\u6bb5\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Arc2Face\u8fd9\u4e00\u8eab\u4efd\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u4eba\u8138\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u8868\u793a\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5ea6\u903c\u771f\u7684\u5408\u6210\u4eba\u8138\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9690\u853d\u7684\u4eba\u8138\u878d\u5408\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7279\u5f81\u70b9\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4eba\u8138\u878d\u5408\u653b\u51fb\u5177\u6709\u6781\u5f3a\u7684\u9690\u853d\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u5a01\u80c1\u5f53\u524d\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u65f6\u6d3b\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002"}}

Existing approaches often abstract adaptation objectives as a reward function and steer diffusion models to generate high-reward samples. However, these approaches can incur high computational overhead due to additional training, or rely on stringent assumptions on the reward such as differentiability. Moreover, despite their empirical success, theoretical justification and guarantees are seldom established. In this paper, we propose DOIT (Doob-Oriented Inference-time Transformation), a training-free and computationally efficient adaptation method that applies to generic, non-differentiable rewards. The key framework underlying our method is a measure transport formulation that seeks to transport the pre-trained generative distribution to a high-reward target distribution. We leverage Doob's $h$-transform to realize this transport, which induces a dynamic correction to the diffusion sampling process and enables efficient simulation-based computation without modifying the pre-trained model. Theoretically, we establish a high probability convergence guarantee to the target high-reward distribution via characterizing the approximation error in the dynamic Doob's correction.

We introduce Generative Causal Mediation (GCM), a procedure for selecting model components, e.g., attention heads, to steer a binary concept (e.g., talk in verse vs. talk in prose) from contrastive long-form responses. In GCM, we first construct a dataset of contrasting inputs and responses. Then, we quantify how individual model components mediate the contrastive concept and select the strongest mediators for steering. We evaluate GCM on three tasks--refusal, sycophancy, and style transfer--across three language models.

It remains computationally demanding whether training from scratch, initialising from pre-trained weights, or fine-tuning large models. Although pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP offer rich image representations, existing adaptation or fine-tuning methods often rely on their global image embeddings, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained, localised attributes essential in complex, cluttered street scenes. To address this, we propose CLIP-MHAdapter, a variant of the current lightweight CLIP adaptation paradigm that appends a bottleneck MLP equipped with multi-head self-attention operating on patch tokens to model inter-patch dependencies. With approximately 1.4 million trainable parameters, CLIP-MHAdapter achieves superior or competitive accuracy across eight attribute classification tasks on the Global StreetScapes dataset, attaining new state-of-the-art results while maintaining low computational cost.

In prior work, NL has been implemented and extensively tested on separable and time series data, and demonstrated its superior performance on both classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we investigate the next step in NL, viz., applying NL to linked data, in particular, data that is represented in the form of knowledge graphs. We integrate linked data into NL by implementing node aggregation on knowledge graphs, and then feeding the aggregated node features to the simplest NL architecture: ChaosNet.

Yet much published work on LMs relies on a relatively small sample of closed-source LMs, limiting our ability to rigorously test psychological theories and evaluate LM capacities. Here, we replicate and extend published work on the false belief task by assessing LM mental state reasoning behavior across 41 open-weight models (from distinct model families). We find sensitivity to implied knowledge states in 34% of the LMs tested; however, consistent with prior work, none fully ``explain away'' the effect in humans. Larger LMs show increased sensitivity and also exhibit higher psychometric predictive power. Finally, we use LM behavior to generate and test a novel hypothesis about human cognition: both humans and LMs show a bias towards attributing false beliefs when knowledge states are cued using a non-factive verb (``John thinks...'') than when cued indirectly (``John looks in the...''). Unlike the primary effect of knowledge states, where human sensitivity exceeds that of LMs, the magnitude of the human knowledge cue effect falls squarely within the distribution of LM effect sizes-suggesting that distributional statistics of language can in principle account for the latter but not the former in humans. These results demonstrate the value of using larger samples of open-weight LMs to test theories of human cognition and evaluate LM capacities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f3041\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LMs\uff09\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a34%\u7684LM\u5bf9\u9690\u542b\u77e5\u8bc6\u72b6\u6001\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u4e00\u5b8c\u5168\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6548\u5e94\uff1b\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u57fa\u4e8eLM\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u65b0\u5047\u8bbe\uff1a\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLM\u5747\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u52a8\u8bcd\uff08\u5982'\u7ea6\u7ff0\u8ba4\u4e3a...'\uff09\u63d0\u793a\u77e5\u8bc6\u72b6\u6001\u65f6\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff0c\u800c\u95f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u5982'\u7ea6\u7ff0\u770b\u5411...'\uff09\u5219\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u72b6\u6001\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e0a\u4ecd\u4f18\u4e8eLM\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6548\u5e94\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0eLM\u5206\u5e03\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7edf\u8ba1\u53ef\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u8be5\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u6574\u4f53\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u68c0\u9a8c\u5fc3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\uff08\u5982\u8bed\u8a00\u66b4\u9732\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c11\u91cf\u5c01\u95ed\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u572841\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6743\u91cd\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u590d\u5236\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5df2\u53d1\u8868\u7684\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4efb\u52a1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9690\u542b\u77e5\u8bc6\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u65b0\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "34%\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u9690\u542b\u77e5\u8bc6\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u529b\uff1b\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u52a8\u8bcd\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7684\u504f\u5411\uff0c\u4e14\u4eba\u7c7b\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u793a\u6548\u5e94\u5927\u5c0f\u843d\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u5e03\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8bed\u8a00\u5206\u5e03\u7edf\u8ba1\u53ef\u90e8\u5206\u89e3\u91ca\u4eba\u7c7b\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u6574\u4f53\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f00\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u5730\u68c0\u9a8c\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u77e5\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7edf\u8ba1\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u9ad8\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002"}}

Adversarial approaches require target-domain adversarial loss during training, which can limit generalization to unseen data, while diffusion-inversion methods often produce low-fidelity translations due to imperfect inversion into noise-latent representations. In this work, we propose the Self-Supervised Semantic Bridge (SSB), a versatile framework that integrates external semantic priors into diffusion bridge models to enable spatially faithful translation without cross-domain supervision. Our key idea is to leverage self-supervised visual encoders to learn representations that are invariant to appearance changes but capture geometric structure, forming a shared latent space that conditions the diffusion bridges. Extensive experiments show that SSB outperforms strong prior methods for challenging medical image synthesis in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, and extends easily to high-quality text-guided editing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8bed\u4e49\u6865\uff08SSB\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u5230\u6269\u6563\u6865\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u8de8\u57df\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fdd\u771f\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u5916\u89c2\u53d8\u5316\u4e0d\u53d8\u4f46\u6355\u6349\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u6269\u6563\u6865\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSSB\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6269\u6563\u548c\u6269\u6563\u53cd\u6f14\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u5b58\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8de8\u57df\u76d1\u7763\u4e14\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5916\u89c2\u4e0d\u53d8\u4f46\u4fdd\u7559\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u6269\u6563\u6865\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3002", "result": "SSB\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5728\u57df\u5185\u8fd8\u662f\u57df\u5916\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8bed\u4e49\u6865\uff08SSB\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u3002"}}

However, existing query-based methods often employ random query initialization and depend on implicit temporal modeling, which lead to temporal inconsistencies and instabilities during the construction of a global map. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel end-to-end framework for consistent online HD vectorized map construction, which jointly performs map instance tracking and short-term prediction. First, we propose a Semantic-Aware Query Generator that initializes queries with spatially aligned semantic masks to capture scene-level context globally. Next, we design a History Rasterized Map Memory to store fine-grained instance-level maps for each tracked instance, enabling explicit historical priors. A History-Map Guidance Module then integrates rasterized map information into track queries, improving temporal continuity. Finally, we propose a Short-Term Future Guidance module to forecast the immediate motion of map instances based on the stored history trajectories. These predicted future locations serve as hints for tracked instances to further avoid implausible predictions and keep temporal consistency.

Revocability is critical in privacy-sensitive applications where users or regulators may request removal of modality-specific information.

However, existing foundation models face a fundamental trade-off: 1D temporal models provide fine-grained pointwise localization but lack a global contextual perspective, while 2D vision-based models capture global patterns but suffer from information bottlenecks due to a lack of temporal alignment and coarse-grained pointwise detection. To resolve this dilemma, we propose VETime, the first TSAD framework that unifies temporal and visual modalities through fine-grained visual-temporal alignment and dynamic fusion. VETime introduces a Reversible Image Conversion and a Patch-Level Temporal Alignment module to establish a shared visual-temporal timeline, preserving discriminative details while maintaining temporal sensitivity. Furthermore, we design an Anomaly Window Contrastive Learning mechanism and a Task-Adaptive Multi-Modal Fusion to adaptively integrate the complementary perceptual strengths of both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VETime significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in zero-shot scenarios, achieving superior localization precision with lower computational overhead than current vision-based approaches.

This paper proposes UCTECG-Net, an uncertainty-aware hybrid architecture that combines one-dimensional convolutions and Transformer encoders to process raw ECG signals and their spectrograms jointly. Evaluated on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and PTB Diagnostic datasets, UCTECG-Net outperforms LSTM, CNN1D, and Transformer baselines in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score, achieving up to 98.58% accuracy on MIT-BIH and 99.14% on PTB. To assess predictive reliability, we integrate three uncertainty quantification methods (Monte Carlo Dropout, Deep Ensembles, and Ensemble Monte Carlo Dropout) into all models and analyze their behavior using an uncertainty-aware confusion matrix and derived metrics.

Moreover, optimizing for faithfulness and interpretability in reasoning often degrades task performance. To address this tradeoff and improve CoT faithfulness, we propose Reasoning Execution by Multiple Listeners (REMUL), a multi-party reinforcement learning approach. REMUL builds on the hypothesis that reasoning traces which other parties can follow will be more faithful. A speaker model generates a reasoning trace, which is truncated and passed to a pool of listener models who \"execute\" the trace, continuing the trace to an answer. Speakers are rewarded for producing reasoning that is clear to listeners, with additional correctness regularization via masked supervised finetuning to counter the tradeoff between faithfulness and performance. On multiple reasoning benchmarks (BIG-Bench Extra Hard, MuSR, ZebraLogicBench, and FOLIO), REMUL consistently and substantially improves three measures of faithfulness -- hint attribution, early answering area over the curve (AOC), and mistake injection AOC -- while also improving accuracy.

However, most existing benchmarks for multimodal foundation models (MFMs) emphasize environment-centric spatial relations (relations among objects in a scene), while largely overlooking observer-centric relationships that require reasoning relative to agent's viewpoint, pose, and motion. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAW-Bench (Situated Awareness in the Real World), a novel benchmark for evaluating egocentric situated awareness using real-world videos. SAW-Bench comprises 786 self-recorded videos captured with Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses spanning diverse indoor and outdoor environments, and over 2,071 human-annotated question-answer pairs. It probes a model's observer-centric understanding with six different awareness tasks. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals a human-model performance gap of 37.66%, even with the best-performing MFM, Gemini 3 Flash. Beyond this gap, our in-depth analysis uncovers several notable findings; for example, while models can exploit partial geometric cues in egocentric videos, they often fail to infer a coherent camera geometry, leading to systematic spatial reasoning errors. We position SAW-Bench as a benchmark for situated spatial intelligence, moving beyond passive observation to understanding physically grounded, observer-centric dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSAW-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6786\u6bb5\u81ea\u5f55\u89c6\u9891\u548c2071\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u4e0a\u768437.66%\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u63a8\u65ad\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u5bfc\u81f4\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u89c6\u89d2\u3001\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaSAW-Bench\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Ray-Ban Meta\uff08Gen 2\uff09\u667a\u80fd\u773c\u955c\u5f55\u5236\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u6837\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684786\u6bb5\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8d85\u8fc72071\u4e2a\u7531\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u516d\u79cd\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578bGemini 3 Flash\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e4b\u95f4\u4ecd\u5b58\u572837.66%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u90e8\u5206\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u4f46\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u63a8\u65ad\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "conclusion": "SAW-Bench\u4f5c\u4e3a\u60c5\u5883\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4ece\u88ab\u52a8\u89c2\u5bdf\u5411\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u624e\u6839\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u52a8\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u8fc8\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Literary theory identifies uncertainty as a necessary condition for creative expression, while current alignment strategies steer models away from uncertain outputs to ensure factuality and reduce hallucination. We formalize this tension by quantifying the \"uncertainty gap\" between human-authored stories and model-generated continuations. Through a controlled information-theoretic analysis of 28 LLMs on high-quality storytelling datasets, we demonstrate that human writing consistently exhibits significantly higher uncertainty than model outputs. We find that instruction-tuned and reasoning models exacerbate this trend compared to their base counterparts; furthermore, the gap is more pronounced in creative writing than in functional domains, and strongly correlates to writing quality. Achieving human-level creativity requires new uncertainty-aware alignment paradigms that can distinguish between destructive hallucinations and the constructive ambiguity required for literary richness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5bb9\u5e73\u5eb8\u9648\u8150\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6587\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u662f\u521b\u9020\u6027\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u5374\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u6d88\u9664\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5206\u679028\u4e2aLLM\u5728\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u53d9\u4e8b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u521b\u4f5c\u7684\u6587\u672c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4e14\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u8be5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u5728\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5c24\u4e3a\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5199\u4f5c\u8d28\u91cf\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u521b\u9020\u529b\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u3001\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u7834\u574f\u6027\u5e7b\u89c9\u4e0e\u5efa\u8bbe\u6027\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5e73\u5eb8\uff0c\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u9648\u8bcd\u6ee5\u8c03\uff0c\u5176\u6839\u6e90\u5728\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u6d88\u9664\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u6587\u5b66\u521b\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u76f8\u6096\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u79cd\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cf\u5316\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f5c\u8005\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f7f\u752828\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u53d9\u4e8b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4e0e\u5199\u4f5c\u8d28\u91cf\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u521b\u4f5c\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u5dee\u8ddd\u66f4\u5927\uff1b\u8be5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u5728\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u4e2d\u66f4\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u5199\u4f5c\u8d28\u91cf\u5448\u5f3a\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8981\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ea7\u521b\u9020\u529b\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u53d1\u5c55\u65b0\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6587\u5b66\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5efa\u8bbe\u6027\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6291\u5236\u6709\u5bb3\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002"}}

Object-centric (OC) representations, which encode a scene as a set of objects, are often argued to support such generalization, but systematic evidence in visually rich settings is limited. We introduce a Visual Question Answering benchmark across three controlled visual worlds (CLEVRTex, Super-CLEVR, and MOVi-C) to measure how well vision encoders, with and without object-centric biases, generalize to unseen combinations of object properties. To ensure a fair and comprehensive comparison, we carefully account for training data diversity, sample size, representation size, downstream model capacity, and compute. We use DINOv2 and SigLIP2, two widely used vision encoders, as the foundation models and their OC counterparts. Our key findings reveal that (1) OC approaches are superior in harder compositional generalization settings; (2) original dense representations surpass OC only on easier settings and typically require substantially more downstream compute; and (3) OC models are more sample efficient, achieving stronger generalization with fewer images, whereas dense encoders catch up or surpass them only with sufficient data and diversity. Overall, object-centric representations offer stronger compositional generalization when any one of dataset size, training data diversity, or downstream compute is constrained.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u53d7\u63a7\u89c6\u89c9\u4e16\u754c\uff08CLEVRTex\u3001Super-CLEVR\u3001MOVi-C\uff09\u4e0a\u6784\u5efa\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u6216\u4e0d\u5177\u6709\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u5c5e\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0a\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528DINOv2\u548cSigLIP2\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7248\u672c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u3001\u8868\u793a\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u4e0b\u6e38\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7b49\u53d8\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u5173\u952e\u53d1\u73b0\u5305\u62ec\uff1a(1) \u5728\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b(2) \u539f\u59cb\u5bc6\u96c6\u8868\u793a\u4ec5\u5728\u8f83\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u4e0b\u6e38\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff1b(3) \u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5177\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u8f83\u5c11\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0b\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u5bc6\u96c6\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u9700\u8db3\u591f\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u624d\u80fd\u8ffd\u4e0a\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u3002\u603b\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u5f53\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6216\u4e0b\u6e38\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\uff0c\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff08OC\uff09\u8868\u793a\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e09\u4e2a\u53d7\u63a7\u89c6\u89c9\u4e16\u754c\uff08CLEVRTex\u3001Super-CLEVR\u3001MOVi-C\uff09\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528DINOv2\u548cSigLIP2\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u53d8\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e25\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u3001\u8868\u793a\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u4e0b\u6e38\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u96be\u5ea6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "(1) \u5728\u590d\u6742\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u8868\u793a\uff1b(2) \u5bc6\u96c6\u8868\u793a\u4ec5\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5360\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u4e0b\u6e38\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b(3) \u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u800c\u5bc6\u96c6\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u624d\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u540c\u7b49\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6216\u4e0b\u6e38\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\uff0c\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8868\u793a\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u7ea6\u675f\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

We also provide a realistic assessment of practical challenges and limitations to application of Bayesian quadrature methods and include an up-to-date and nearly exhaustive bibliography that covers not only machine learning and statistics literature but all areas of mathematics and engineering in which Bayesian quadrature or equivalent methods have seen use.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7efc\u8ff0\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u79ef\u5206\uff08Bayesian quadrature\uff09\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u53ca\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6311\u6218\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u79ef\u5206\u81ea1980\u5e74\u4ee3\u5c31\u5df2\u63d0\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u3001\u5168\u9762\u6027\u7684\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e0e\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff1b\u7efc\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1b\u6574\u7406\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u7684\u6587\u732e\u8d44\u6599\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u6587\u732e\u5e93\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e3a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u79ef\u5206\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Preprint submitted to Pattern Recognition Letters", "summary": "Despite the continuous research and evolution of language models, they sometimes underperform previous versions. Existing approaches to overcome these challenges are resource-intensive, highlighting the need for alternatives that enable immediate action. We assume that each language model has a local module inside that is suitable for a specific function. First, this work identifies a set of modules showing consistent and local activation changes under an inference workload through activation-based analysis. Subsequently, we transplant an internal module that is properly activated for a specific task into the target model, leading to immediate and measurable functional changes without additional training or fine-tuning. To experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the transplant technique, we quantify the relationship between transplant strength and performance improvement under different conditions for two language models. In the cross-generation setting, we find that transplanting activation-selected modules can substantially improve the underperforming model, reaching up to twice the target baseline and achieving gap-based recovery above 100%. Moreover, in transplant experiments between a base model and its instruction-tuned counterpart, transplantation improves the underperforming model toward the stronger baseline, yielding up to about 2.33 times the target baseline with gap-based recovery reaching up to 100% in the best case. These results show that meaningful capacity transfer can be realized through the implantation of highly localized modules implied by language models. Overall, this work provides empirical evidence for task-localized modularity in language models and presents a new research area: model transplantation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u5373\u53ef\u7acb\u5373\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u6a21\u578b\u79fb\u690d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u5c40\u90e8\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u79fb\u690d\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u529f\u80fd\u4e0a\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u751f\u6210\u548c\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u79fb\u690d\u6a21\u5757\u65f6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u57fa\u51c6\u76842\u500d\u751a\u81f32.33\u500d\uff0c\u5dee\u8ddd\u6062\u590d\u8d85\u8fc7100%\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5f00\u521b\u4e86\u2018\u6a21\u578b\u79fb\u690d\u2019\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6f14\u8fdb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5373\u65f6\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u88ab\u5229\u7528\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u529f\u80fd\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u5c40\u90e8\u6fc0\u6d3b\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u5757\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u6a21\u5757\u79fb\u690d\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u529f\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u3002\u8be5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8de8\u751f\u6210\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u79fb\u690d\u6fc0\u6d3b\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u53ef\u4f7f\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u4e24\u500d\uff0c\u5dee\u8ddd\u6062\u590d\u8d85\u8fc7100%\uff1b\u5728\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u79fb\u690d\u4e2d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u8fbe\u57fa\u51c6\u76842.33\u500d\uff0c\u5dee\u8ddd\u6062\u590d\u8fbe100%\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u2014\u2014\u6a21\u578b\u79fb\u690d\uff0c\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While allocating additional inference-time computation has proven effective for large language models (LLMs), achieving similar scaling in VLMs remains challenging. A key obstacle is that visual inputs are typically provided only once at the start of generation, while textual reasoning (e.g., early visual summaries) is generated autoregressively, causing reasoning to become increasingly text-dominated and allowing early visual grounding errors to accumulate. Moreover, vanilla guidance for visual grounding during inference is often coarse and noisy, making it difficult to steer reasoning over long texts. To address these challenges, we propose \\emph{Saliency-Aware Principle} (SAP) selection. SAP operates on high-level reasoning principles rather than token-level trajectories, which enable stable control over discrete generation under noisy feedback while allowing later reasoning steps to re-consult visual evidence when renewed grounding is required. In addition, SAP supports multi-route inference, enabling parallel exploration of diverse reasoning behaviors. SAP is model-agnostic and data-free, requiring no additional training. Empirical results show that SAP achieves competitive performance, especially in reducing object hallucination, under comparable token-generation budgets while yielding more stable reasoning and lower response latency than CoT-style long sequential reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSaliency-Aware Principle\uff08SAP\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u9636\u63a8\u7406\u539f\u5219\u800c\u975e\u9010\u6807\u8bb0\u53cd\u9988\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u652f\u6301\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u4ec5\u521d\u59cb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u6b21\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6587\u672c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u79ef\u7d2f\u65e9\u671f\u89c6\u89c9\u8bef\u5224\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u5f0f\u7c97\u7565\u4e14\u566a\u58f0\u5927\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6307\u5bfc\u957f\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSaliency-Aware Principle\uff08SAP\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u9636\u63a8\u7406\u539f\u5219\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u9700\u8981\u65f6\u91cd\u65b0\u67e5\u9605\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSAP\u5728\u76f8\u8fd1\u751f\u6210\u5f00\u9500\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SAP\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

First, I analyze standard coreference evaluations and show that their design often leads to non-generalizable conclusions due to issues of measurement validity - including contestedness (multiple, competing definitions of coreference) and convergent validity (evaluation results that rank models differently across benchmarks). Second, I propose and implement a novel evaluation focused on testing systems' ability to infer the relative plausibility of events, a key aspect of resolving coreference. Through this extended evaluation, I find that contemporary language models demonstrate strong performance on standard benchmarks - improving over earlier baseline systems within certain domains and types of coreference - but remain sensitive to the evaluation conditions: they often fail to generalize in ways one would expect a human to be capable of when evaluation contexts are slightly modified. Taken together, these findings clarify both the strengths, such as improved accuracy over baselines on widely used evaluations, and the limitations of the current NLP paradigm, including weaknesses in measurement validity, and suggest directions for future work in developing better evaluation methods and more genuinely generalizable systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5171\u6307\u6d88\u89e3\u8bc4\u4f30\u6240\u80fd\u5f97\u51fa\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u5171\u6307\u8bc4\u4f30\u56e0\u6d4b\u91cf\u6709\u6548\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u5171\u6307\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u4e89\u8bae\u6027\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u8bba\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a8\u65ad\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u5bf9\u5408\u7406\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u5171\u6307\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u57fa\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u6761\u4ef6\u7a0d\u4f5c\u4fee\u6539\u65f6\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u73b0\u6709NLP\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6709\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4e14\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5177\u901a\u7528\u6027\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5171\u6307\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6d4b\u91cf\u6709\u6548\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0d\u7edf\u4e00\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u51c6\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u8bba\u96be\u4ee5\u63a8\u5e7f\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4eba\u7c7b\u822c\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u6807\u51c6\u5171\u6307\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f3a\u9677\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a8\u65ad\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u5bf9\u5408\u7406\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5176\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5171\u6307\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u666e\u904d\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u73af\u5883\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6d4b\u91cf\u6709\u6548\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6b20\u7f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5171\u6307\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u867d\u6709\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u4f46\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u53d1\u5c55\u66f4\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u771f\u6b63\u5177\u5907\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8de8\u60c5\u5883\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u901a\u7528NLP\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Therefore, mitigating the adverse effects of low-predictability samples is crucial for time series analysis tasks such as time series forecasting (TSF) and time series classification (TSC). While many deep learning models have achieved promising performance, few consider how to identify and penalize low-predictability samples to improve model performance from the training perspective. To fill this gap, we propose a general Amortized Predictability-aware Training Framework (APTF) for both TSF and TSC. APTF introduces two key designs that enable the model to focus on high-predictability samples while still learning appropriately from low-predictability ones: (i) a Hierarchical Predictability-aware Loss (HPL) that dynamically identifies low-predictability samples and progressively expands their loss penalty as training evolves, and (ii) an amortization model that mitigates predictability estimation errors caused by model bias, further enhancing HPL's effectiveness.

While scaling has improved average-case performance, persistent failures on low-frequency, domain-specific, cultural, and temporal knowledge remain poorly characterized. This paper develops a structured taxonomy and analysis of long-Tail Knowledge in large language models, synthesizing prior work across technical and sociotechnical perspectives.\n  We introduce a structured analytical framework that synthesizes prior work across four complementary axes: how long-Tail Knowledge is defined, the mechanisms by which it is lost or distorted during training and inference, the technical interventions proposed to mitigate these failures, and the implications of these failures for fairness, accountability, transparency, and user trust. We further examine how existing evaluation practices obscure tail behavior and complicate accountability for rare but consequential failures. The paper concludes by identifying open challenges related to privacy, sustainability, and governance that constrain long-Tail Knowledge representation.

Latent actions provide a natural interface for users to iteratively generate and manipulate videos. However, most existing approaches rely on monolithic inverse and forward dynamics models that learn a single latent action to control the entire scene, and therefore struggle in complex environments where multiple entities act simultaneously. This paper introduces Factored Latent Action Model (FLAM), a factored dynamics framework that decomposes the scene into independent factors, each inferring its own latent action and predicting its own next-step factor value. This factorized structure enables more accurate modeling of complex multi-entity dynamics and improves video generation quality in action-free video settings compared to monolithic models. Based on experiments on both simulation and real-world multi-entity datasets, we find that FLAM outperforms prior work in prediction accuracy and representation quality, and facilitates downstream policy learning, demonstrating the benefits of factorized latent action models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\uff08FLAM\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u573a\u666f\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u56e0\u5b50\u72ec\u7acb\u63a8\u65ad\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u5b9e\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\uff0cFLAM\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u7684\u9006\u5411\u548c\u524d\u5411\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u591a\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f53\u540c\u65f6\u884c\u52a8\u7684\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5206\u89e3\u573a\u666f\u5e76\u5206\u522b\u5efa\u6a21\u5404\u5b9e\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "FLAM\u91c7\u7528\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u573a\u666f\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u82e5\u5e72\u72ec\u7acb\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u56e0\u5b50\u72ec\u7acb\u5b66\u4e60\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u4e00\u65f6\u523b\u7684\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u591a\u5b9e\u4f53\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u591a\u5b9e\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFLAM\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u591a\u5b9e\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u662f\u8fc8\u5411\u9ad8\u9636\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

We conduct a systematic benchmark of 17 LLMs using a unified evaluation framework. Our analysis uncovers annotator bias and substantial instability in model judgments.

For the case of universal prediction of a stochastic process over a countable alphabet, our bound states a convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2} \u03b4^{-1/2})$ with probability as least $1-\u03b4$ compared to prior known in-expectation bounds of the order $\\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2})$.

We construct multiple datasets, covering knowledge-informed features and line-of sight (LOS) magnetograms. We also apply three deep learning models (CNN, CNN-BiLSTM, and Transformer) and three CDR counterparts (CDR-CNN, CDR-CNN-BiLSTM, and CDR-Transformer). First, we analyze the importance of LOS magnetic field parameters with the Transformer, then compare its performance using LOS-only, vector-only, and combined magnetic field parameters. Second, we compare flare prediction performance based on CDR models versus deep learning counterparts. Third, we perform sensitivity analysis on reward engineering for CDR models. Fourth, we use the SHAP method for model interpretability. Finally, we conduct performance comparison between our models and NASA/CCMC. The main findings are: (1)Among LOS feature combinations, R_VALUE and AREA_ACR consistently yield the best results. (2)Transformer achieves better performance with combined LOS and vector magnetic field data than with either alone. (3)Models using knowledge-informed features outperform those using magnetograms. (4)While CNN and CNN-BiLSTM outperform their CDR counterparts on magnetograms, CDR-Transformer is slightly superior to its deep learning counterpart when using knowledge-informed features. Among all models, CDR-Transformer achieves the best performance. (5)The predictive performance of the CDR models is not overly sensitive to the reward choices.(6)Through SHAP analysis, the CDR model tends to regard TOTUSJH as more important, while the Transformer tends to prioritize R_VALUE more.(7)Under identical prediction time and active region (AR) number, the CDR-Transformer shows superior predictive capabilities compared to NASA/CCMC.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5e26\u6709\u7c7b\u522b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5956\u52b1\uff08CDR\uff09\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e24\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185\u9884\u6d4b\u2265M\u7ea7\u8000\u6591\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u89c6\u5411\u78c1\u56fe\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08CNN\u3001CNN-BiLSTM\u3001Transformer\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684CDR\u7248\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u5411\u4e0e\u77e2\u91cf\u78c1\u573a\u6570\u636e\u7684Transformer\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u78c1\u56fe\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u4e0b\uff0cCDR-Transformer\u7565\u80dc\u4e8e\u666e\u901aTransformer\uff1bCDR\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\uff1bSHAP\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793aCDR\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u91cd\u89c6TOTUSJH\uff0c\u800cTransformer\u66f4\u770b\u91cdR_VALUE\uff1b\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u6d3b\u8dc3\u533a\u6570\u91cf\u4e0b\uff0cCDR-Transformer\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8eNASA/CCMC\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8000\u6591\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u5177\u6709\u7c7b\u522b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u592a\u9633\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u5747\u8861\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u542b\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u89c6\u5411\u78c1\u56fe\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528CNN\u3001CNN-BiLSTM\u3001Transformer\u4e09\u7c7b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684CDR\u7248\u672c\uff08CDR-CNN\u3001CDR-CNN-BiLSTM\u3001CDR-Transformer\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u8f93\u5165\u7ec4\u5408\uff08\u89c6\u5411\u3001\u77e2\u91cf\u3001\u6df7\u5408\uff09\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SHAP\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eNASA/CCMC\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "1.

We introduce the Multi-Check-Worthy (MultiCW) dataset, a balanced multilingual benchmark for check-worthy claim detection spanning 16 languages, 7 topical domains, and 2 writing styles. It consists of 123,722 samples, evenly distributed between noisy (informal) and structured (formal) texts, with balanced representation of check-worthy and non-check-worthy classes across all languages. To probe robustness, we also introduce an equally balanced out-of-distribution evaluation set of 27,761 samples in 4 additional languages. To provide baselines, we benchmark 3 common fine-tuned multilingual transformers against a diverse set of 15 commercial and open LLMs under zero-shot settings. Our findings show that fine-tuned models consistently outperform zero-shot LLMs on claim classification and show strong out-of-distribution generalization across languages, domains, and styles. MultiCW provides a rigorous multilingual resource for advancing automated fact-checking and enables systematic comparisons between fine-tuned models and cutting-edge LLMs on the check-worthy claim detection task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MultiCW\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6db5\u76d616\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u30017\u4e2a\u4e3b\u9898\u9886\u57df\u548c2\u79cd\u5199\u4f5c\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u503c\u5f97\u6838\u67e5\u7684\u58f0\u660e\u3002\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b123,722\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5206\u4e3a\u566a\u58f0\uff08\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\uff09\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\uff08\u6b63\u5f0f\uff09\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u5747\u8861\u5206\u5e03\u503c\u5f97\u6838\u67e5\u4e0e\u4e0d\u503c\u5f97\u6838\u67e5\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b4\u79cd\u989d\u5916\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5747\u8861\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u5206\u5e03\u8bc4\u4f30\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5bf93\u79cd\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u548c15\u79cd\u5546\u4e1a\u53ca\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u58f0\u660e\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u548c\u8de8\u98ce\u683c\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002MultiCW\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7ec6\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u524d\u6cbf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u503c\u5f97\u6838\u67e5\u58f0\u660e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u6b63\u5728\u91cd\u5851\u5a92\u4f53\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u58eb\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u503c\u5f97\u6838\u67e5\u7684\u58f0\u660e\u2014\u2014\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\u2014\u2014\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u63a8\u52a8\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u540d\u4e3aMultiCW\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u591a\u9886\u57df\u3001\u591a\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b123,722\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u8986\u76d616\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u30017\u4e2a\u4e3b\u9898\u9886\u57df\u548c2\u79cd\u5199\u4f5c\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b4\u79cd\u989d\u5916\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5916\u5206\u5e03\u8bc4\u4f30\u96c6\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5bf93\u79cd\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u548c15\u79cd\u5546\u4e1a/\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u503c\u5f97\u6838\u67e5\u58f0\u660e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u58f0\u660e\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u548c\u8de8\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u5916\u5206\u5e03\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u7ec6\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "conclusion": "MultiCW\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u503c\u5f97\u6838\u67e5\u58f0\u660e\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u878d\u5408\u7ec6\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We first analyze Boltzmann Q-learning with decaying temperature and show that its regret depends critically on the suboptimality gap of the MDP: for sufficiently large gaps, the regret is sublinear, while for small gaps it deteriorates and can approach linear growth. To address this limitation, we study a Smoothed $\u03b5_n$-Greedy exploration scheme that combines $\u03b5_n$-greedy and Boltzmann exploration, for which we prove a gap-robust regret bound of near-$\\tilde{O}(N^{9/10})$.

In deployed settings, long contexts are typically managed through compaction in token space via summarization. However, summarization can be highly lossy, substantially harming downstream performance. Recent work on Cartridges has shown that it is possible to train highly compact KV caches in latent space that closely match full-context performance, but at the cost of slow and expensive end-to-end optimization. This work describes an approach for fast context compaction in latent space through Attention Matching, which constructs compact keys and values to reproduce attention outputs and preserve attention mass at a per-KV-head level.

To isolate the effect of agentic structure, we also develop a closely matched prompting-based baseline using the same model and instructions. Both methods are evaluated across three ABSA subtasks (Aspect Term Extraction (ATE), Aspect Sentiment Classification (ATSC), and Aspect Sentiment Pair Extraction (ASPE)), four SemEval datasets, and two encoder-decoder models: T5-Base and Tk-Instruct. Our results show that the agentic augmentation outperforms raw prompting in label preservation of the augmented data, especially when the tasks require aspect term generation. In addition, when combined with real data, agentic augmentation provides higher gains, consistently outperforming prompting-based generation. These benefits are most pronounced for T5-Base, while the more heavily pretrained Tk-Instruct exhibits smaller improvements.

This paper introduces IndicEval, a scalable benchmarking platform designed to assess LLM performance using authentic high-stakes examination questions from UPSC, JEE, and NEET across STEM and humanities domains in both English and Hindi. Unlike synthetic benchmarks, IndicEval grounds evaluation in real examination standards, enabling realistic measurement of reasoning, domain knowledge, and bilingual adaptability. The framework automates assessment using Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies and supports modular integration of new models and languages. Experiments conducted on Gemini 2.0 Flash, GPT-4, Claude, and LLaMA 3-70B reveal three major findings. First, CoT prompting consistently improves reasoning accuracy, with substantial gains across subjects and languages. Second, significant cross-model performance disparities persist, particularly in high-complexity examinations.

We first extend existing results on the implicit bias of steepest descent in homogeneous models to normalized steepest descent with an optional learning rate schedule. We then show that for smooth homogeneous models, momentum steepest descent algorithms like Muon (spectral norm), MomentumGD ($\\ell_2$ norm), and Signum ($\\ell_\\infty$ norm) are approximate steepest descent trajectories under a decaying learning rate schedule, proving that these algorithms too have a bias towards KKT points of the corresponding margin maximization problem. We extend the analysis to Adam (without the stability constant), which maximizes the $\\ell_\\infty$ margin, and to Muon-Signum and Muon-Adam, which maximize a hybrid norm. Our experiments corroborate the theory and show that the identity of the margin maximized depends on the choice of optimizer.

However, translated text differs systematically from native text. This phenomenon is known as translationese, and it reflects both traces of the source language and characteristic properties of translation itself. In this paper, we study how training on machine-translated data affects small English language models, focusing on how translationese from different source languages shapes linguistic acceptability judgments and language modelling for different domains. We train models on English text translated from 24 typologically and resource-diverse source languages, enabling a systematic analysis of how source language and corpus properties influence what models learn. Our results show that the source language has a clear impact on model behavior: general perplexity is more driven by the lexical diversity of the translated corpus, while grammatical performance is strongly correlated to typological similarity to English, given enough data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c0f\u578b\u82f1\u8bed\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u98ce\u683c\uff08translationese\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8bed\u8a00\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u572824\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5dee\u5f02\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u8bed\u6599\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff1a\u6574\u4f53\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8bed\u6599\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u800c\u8bed\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u5219\u4e0e\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u82f1\u8bed\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u5b66\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5145\u8db3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6570\u636e\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00NLP\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u539f\u751f\u6587\u672c\u65f6\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6587\u672c\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5373\u7ffb\u8bd1\u98ce\u683c\uff08translationese\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u8bed\u6599\u7279\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6765\u81ea24\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u82f1\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c0f\u578b\u82f1\u8bed\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u8bed\u6599\u7279\u6027\uff08\u5982\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u7c7b\u578b\u5b66\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u660e\u663e\u5f71\u54cd\uff1a\u6574\u4f53\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8bed\u6599\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\u51b3\u5b9a\uff1b\u800c\u8bed\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u5219\u4e0e\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u82f1\u8bed\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u5b66\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5145\u8db3\u65f6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u4e0e\u82f1\u8bed\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u5b66\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u82f1\u8bed\u6a21\u578b\u8bed\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u800c\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5219\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u5e94\u8003\u8651\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u8bed\u6599\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

The classifier is trained to detect faults in a benchmark non-linear chemical process, the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP). It is highlighted how XAI methods can help identify the subsystem of the process where the fault occurred. Using our knowledge of the process, we note that in most cases the same features are indicated as the most important for the decision, while insome cases the SHAP method seems to be more informative and closer to the root cause of the fault.

To address this, we introduce Team-of-Thoughts, a novel MAS architecture that leverages the complementary capabilities of heterogeneous agents via an orchestrator-tool paradigm. Our framework introduces two key mechanisms to optimize performance: (1) an orchestrator calibration scheme that identifies models with superior coordination capabilities, and (2) a self-assessment protocol where tool agents profile their own domain expertise to account for variations in post-training skills.

We propose a new algorithm that significantly relaxes the requirement on $\u03b5$. Our approach is novel and of technical interest by itself.

We provide a mechanistic unification: looped and depth-grown models exhibit convergent depth-wise signatures, including increased reliance on late layers and recurring patterns aligned with the looped or grown block. These shared signatures support the view that their gains stem from a common form of iterative computation. Building on this connection, we show that the two techniques are adaptable and composable: applying inference-time looping to the middle blocks of a depth-grown model improves accuracy on some reasoning primitives by up to $2\\times$, despite the model never being trained to loop. Both approaches also adapt better than the baseline when given more in-context examples or additional supervised fine-tuning data. Additionally, depth-grown models achieve the largest reasoning gains when using higher-quality, math-heavy cooldown mixtures, which can be further boosted by adapting a middle block to loop.

However, soft prompts rely on high-dimensional, implicit representations and lack explicit semantics and traceable training behaviors, which limits their interpretability. To address this limitation, we propose a soft prompt tuning optimization method based on topological morphological evolution. Specifically, we employ persistent homology from topological data analysis (TDA) to quantify the structural representations of soft prompts in continuous parameter space and their training process evolution. Quantitative analysis shows that topologically stable and compact soft prompts achieve better downstream performance. Based on this empirical observation, we construct a loss function for optimizing soft prompt tuning, termed Topological Soft Prompt Loss (TSLoss). TSLoss guides the model to learn structurally stable adaptations by quantifying inter-parameter connectivity and redundancy. Extensive experiments show that training with TSLoss accelerates convergence and improves tuning performance, providing an interpretable method to understand and optimize soft prompt tuning from structural and topological perspectives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u62d3\u6251\u5f62\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff08TDA\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u540c\u8c03\u6280\u672f\u91cf\u5316\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u793a\u53ca\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u62d3\u6251\u4e0a\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u62d3\u6251\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u635f\u5931\uff08TSLoss\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u95f4\u7684\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u6027\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u6784\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u3002TSLoss\u4e0d\u4ec5\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8c03\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u62d3\u6251\u89c6\u89d2\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u867d\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u7ef4\u9690\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u540c\u8c03\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u62d3\u6251\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u62d3\u6251\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u635f\u5931\uff08TSLoss\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6307\u5bfc\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528TSLoss\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8c03\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u62d3\u6251\u89c6\u89d2\u4f18\u5316\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Submitted to the PoliticalNLP 2026 workshop, co-located with LREC 2026 conference", "summary": "This paper introduces ParlaCAP, a large-scale dataset for analyzing parliamentary agenda setting across Europe, and proposes a cost-effective method for building domain-specific policy topic classifiers. Applying the Comparative Agendas Project (CAP) schema to the multilingual ParlaMint corpus of over 8 million speeches from 28 parliaments of European countries and autonomous regions, we follow a teacher-student framework in which a high-performing large language model (LLM) annotates in-domain training data and a multilingual encoder model is fine-tuned on these annotations for scalable data annotation. We show that this approach produces a classifier tailored to the target domain. Agreement between the LLM and human annotators is comparable to inter-annotator agreement among humans, and the resulting model outperforms existing CAP classifiers trained on manually-annotated but out-of-domain data. In addition to the CAP annotations, the ParlaCAP dataset offers rich speaker and party metadata, as well as sentiment predictions coming from the ParlaSent multilingual transformer model, enabling comparative research on political attention and representation across countries. We illustrate the analytical potential of the dataset with three use cases, examining the distribution of parliamentary attention across policy topics, sentiment patterns in parliamentary speech, and gender differences in policy attention.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faParlaCAP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u653f\u7b56\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e0e\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u5e08\u751f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bae\u4f1a\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6807\u6ce8\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u9886\u57df\u5185\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5916\u90e8\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bae\u5458\u3001\u653f\u515a\u5143\u6570\u636e\u53ca\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u5173\u6ce8\u5ea6\u3001\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0e\u60c5\u7eea\u6a21\u5f0f\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5206\u6790\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u653f\u7b56\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\u5de5\u5177\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u975e\u9886\u57df\u5185\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u800c\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u9886\u57df\u5185\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6b27\u6d32\u8bae\u4f1a\u8bae\u7a0b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u56fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5bf9\u9886\u57df\u5185\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u518d\u4ee5\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bae\u7a0b\u9879\u76ee\uff08CAP\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u8d85\u8fc7800\u4e07\u6761\u6765\u81ea28\u4e2a\u6b27\u6d32\u8bae\u4f1a\u7684\u6f14\u8bb2\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fbe\u5230\u4eba\u7c7b\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6c34\u5e73\uff1b\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5916\u90e8\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u6240\u6784\u5efa\u7684ParlaCAP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5177\u5907\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u8bae\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "ParlaCAP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6b27\u6d32\u8bae\u4f1a\u8bae\u7a0b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u6280\u672f\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u56fd\u5bb6\u3001\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u5173\u6ce8\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u4e0e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

This approach risks creating systems that achieve narrow fairness metrics while exacerbating disparities along untargeted attributes, a phenomenon known as bias spillover. While extensively studied in machine learning, bias spillover remains critically underexplored in LLM alignment. In this work, we investigate how targeted gender alignment affects fairness across nine sensitive attributes in three state-of-the-art LLMs (Mistral 7B, Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B). Using Direct Preference Optimization and the BBQ benchmark, we evaluate fairness under ambiguous and disambiguous contexts. Our findings reveal noticeable bias spillover: while aggregate results show improvements, context-aware analysis exposes significant degradations in ambiguous contexts, particularly for physical appearance ($p< 0.001$ across all models), sexual orientation, and disability status. We demonstrate that improving fairness along one attribute can inadvertently worsen disparities in others under uncertainty, highlighting the necessity of context-aware, multi-attribute fairness evaluation frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u522b\u516c\u5e73\u5bf9\u9f50\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e5d\u4e2a\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6574\u4f53\u6307\u6807\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u6ea2\u51fa\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8eab\u4f53\u5916\u8c8c\u3001\u6027\u53d6\u5411\u548c\u6b8b\u75be\u72b6\u51b5\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u91c7\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u516c\u5e73\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfLLM\u516c\u5e73\u5bf9\u9f50\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u4e00\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u6027\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u672a\u88ab\u5173\u6ce8\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u52a0\u5267\uff0c\u5373\u504f\u89c1\u6ea2\u51fa\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u5728LLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08DPO\uff09\u4e0eBBQ\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u5148\u8fdbLLM\uff08Mistral 7B\u3001Llama 3.1 8B\u3001Qwen 2.5 7B\uff09\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u4e0e\u660e\u786e\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u603b\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u8eab\u4f53\u5916\u8c8c\u3001\u6027\u53d6\u5411\u548c\u6b8b\u75be\u72b6\u51b5\u7b49\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff08p<0.001\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u76ee\u6807\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u5bf9\u9f50\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u6076\u5316\u5176\u4ed6\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u5347\u67d0\u4e00\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u52a0\u5267\u5176\u4ed6\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5fc5\u987b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u534f\u540c\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u5168\u9762\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002"}}

In mathematics tutoring transcripts, numeric expressions frequently resemble structured identifiers (e.g., dates or IDs), leading generic Personally Identifiable Information (PII) detection systems to over-redact core instructional content and reduce dataset utility. This work asks how PII can be detected in math tutoring transcripts while preserving their educational utility. To address this challenge, we investigate the \"numeric ambiguity\" problem and introduce MathEd-PII, the first benchmark dataset for PII detection in math tutoring dialogues, created through a human-in-the-loop LLM workflow that audits upstream redactions and generates privacy-preserving surrogates. The dataset contains 1,000 tutoring sessions (115,620 messages; 769,628 tokens) with validated PII annotations. Using a density-based segmentation method, we show that false PII redactions are disproportionately concentrated in math-dense regions, confirming numeric ambiguity as a key failure mode. We then compare four detection strategies: a Presidio baseline and LLM-based approaches with basic, math-aware, and segment-aware prompting. Math-aware prompting substantially improves performance over the baseline (F1: 0.821 vs. 0.379) while reducing numeric false positives, demonstrating that de-identification must incorporate domain context to preserve analytic utility.

Automatic summarization can help address this challenge by producing concise summaries for each discussion subject. Despite its potential, research on summarizing discussion subjects in municipal meeting minutes remains largely unexplored, especially in low-resource languages, where the inherent complexity of these documents adds further challenges. A major bottleneck is the scarcity of datasets containing high-quality, manually crafted summaries, which limits the development and evaluation of effective summarization models for this domain. In this paper, we present CitiLink-Summ, a new corpus of European Portuguese municipal meeting minutes, comprising 100 documents and 2,322 manually hand-written summaries, each corresponding to a distinct discussion subject. Leveraging this dataset, we establish baseline results for automatic summarization in this domain, employing state-of-the-art generative models (e.g., BART, PRIMERA) as well as large language models (LLMs), evaluated with both lexical and semantic metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR, and BERTScore. CitiLink-Summ provides the first benchmark for municipal-domain summarization in European Portuguese, offering a valuable resource for advancing NLP research on complex administrative texts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CitiLink-Summ\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b100\u4efd\u8461\u8404\u7259\u8bed\u5e02\u653f\u4f1a\u8bae\u7eaa\u8981\u53ca2,322\u4e2a\u624b\u52a8\u64b0\u5199\u7684\u6458\u8981\u7684\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u5e02\u653f\u4f1a\u8bae\u8bb0\u5f55\u81ea\u52a8\u6458\u8981\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982BART\u3001PRIMERA\uff09\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982ROUGE\u3001BERTScore\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6458\u8981\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u6b27\u6d32\u8461\u8404\u7259\u8bed\u5e02\u653f\u9886\u57df\u6587\u672c\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6458\u8981\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e02\u653f\u4f1a\u8bae\u7eaa\u8981\u5185\u5bb9\u5197\u957f\u4e14\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u88ab\u516c\u4f17\u7406\u89e3\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6458\u8981\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u6458\u8981\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7f3a\u4e4f\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaCitiLink-Summ\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u5305\u542b100\u7bc7\u6b27\u6d32\u8461\u8404\u7259\u8bed\u5e02\u653f\u4f1a\u8bae\u7eaa\u8981\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u7ea7\u624b\u5de5\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528BART\u3001PRIMERA\u7b49\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u6458\u8981\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408ROUGE\u3001BLEU\u3001METEOR\u3001BERTScore\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "CitiLink-Summ\u6210\u529f\u5efa\u7acb\u9996\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u6b27\u6d32\u8461\u8404\u7259\u8bed\u5e02\u653f\u6587\u6863\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6458\u8981\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5177\u5907\u4e00\u5b9a\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0b\u5e02\u653f\u4f1a\u8bae\u7eaa\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u6458\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u76f8\u5173\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

In this work, we address the gap between training with full steps with low-rank projections (SVDLoRA) and LoRA fine-tuning. We propose LoRSum, a memory-efficient subroutine that closes this gap for gradient descent by casting LoRA optimization as a proximal sub-problem and solving it efficiently with alternating least squares updates, which we prove to be an implicit block power method. We recover several recently proposed preconditioning methods for LoRA as special cases, and show that LoRSum can also be used for updating a low-rank momentum. In order to address full steps with preconditioned gradient descent, we propose a scaled variant of LoRSum that uses structured metrics such as K-FAC and Shampoo, and we show that storing the diagonal of these metrics still allows them to perform well while remaining memory-efficient. Experiments on a synthetic task, CIFAR-100, and language-model fine-tuning on GLUE, SQuAD v2, and WikiText-103, show that our method can match or improve LoRA baselines given modest compute overhead, while avoiding full-matrix SVD projections and retaining LoRA-style parameter efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "LoRSum \u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b50\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06 LoRA \u4f18\u5316\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8fd1\u7aef\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4ea4\u66ff\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4e3a\u9690\u5f0f\u5757\u5e42\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u591a\u79cd\u8fd1\u671f\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u65b0\u4f4e\u79e9\u52a8\u91cf\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7f29\u653e\u53d8\u4f53\u4ee5\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08\u5982 K-FAC\u3001Shampoo\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u5b58\u50a8\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ebf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4e0b\u53ef\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a LoRA \u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u5168\u77e9\u9635 SVD \u6295\u5f71\u5e76\u7ef4\u6301\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709 LoRA \u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u6295\u5f71\uff08\u5982 SVDLoRA\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f25\u5408\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u79e9\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa LoRSum\uff0c\u5c06 LoRA \u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8fd1\u7aef\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u66ff\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u9690\u5f0f\u5757\u5e42\u6cd5\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u7f29\u653e\u7248 LoRSum \u4ee5\u9002\u914d\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08\u5982 K-FAC\u3001Shampoo\uff09\uff0c\u4ec5\u5b58\u50a8\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ebf\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u3001CIFAR-100 \u53ca\u591a\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\uff08GLUE\u3001SQuAD v2\u3001WikiText-103\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9002\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4e0b\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709 LoRA \u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5168\u77e9\u9635 SVD \u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u9ad8\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "LoRSum \u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f4e\u79e9\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u662f LoRA \u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u9884\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Notably, a fully ColBERT-pre-trained model, ColBERT-Zero, trained only on public data, outperforms GTE-ModernColBERT as well as its base model, GTE-ModernBERT, which leverages closed and much stronger data, setting new state-of-the-art for model this size. We also find that, although performing only a small KD step is not enough to achieve results close to full pre-training, adding a supervised step beforehand allows to achieve much closer performance while skipping the most costly unsupervised phase. Finally, we find that aligning the fine-tuning and pre-training setups is crucial when repurposing existing models.

To address this within standard deep learning benchmark settings, we propose the Hierarchical Patching Mixer (HPMixer), which models periodicity and residuals in a decoupled yet complementary manner. The periodic component utilizes a learnable cycle module [7] enhanced with a nonlinear channel-wise MLP for greater expressiveness. The residual component is processed through a Learnable Stationary Wavelet Transform (LSWT) to extract stable, shift-invariant frequency-domain representations. Subsequently, a channel-mixing encoder models explicit inter-channel dependencies, while a two-level non-overlapping hierarchical patching mechanism captures coarse- and fine-scale residual variations. By integrating decoupled periodicity modeling with structured, multi-scale residual learning, HPMixer provides an effective framework. Extensive experiments on standard multivariate benchmarks demonstrate that HPMixer achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to recent baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "HPMixer\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u957f\u671f\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u4f46\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u5468\u671f\u6027\u4e0e\u6b8b\u5dee\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u5176\u5468\u671f\u90e8\u5206\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u5757\u7ed3\u5408\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u901a\u9053\u7ea7MLP\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u6b8b\u5dee\u90e8\u5206\u5219\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u5e73\u7a33\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\uff08LSWT\uff09\u63d0\u53d6\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u5e73\u79fb\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u9891\u57df\u8868\u793a\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u5c42\u975e\u91cd\u53e0\u5206\u5757\u673a\u5236\u6355\u6349\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6b8b\u5dee\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u501f\u52a9\u901a\u9053\u6df7\u5408\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5efa\u6a21\u8de8\u901a\u9053\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u6574\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u957f\u671f\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u5468\u671f\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u52a8\u6001\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u5c06\u4e8c\u8005\u6df7\u6742\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5206\u79bb\u4e0e\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u8026\u5468\u671f\u6027\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u5206\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHierarchical Patching Mixer (HPMixer)\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a(1) \u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u5757 + \u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u901a\u9053\u7ea7MLP\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u5468\u671f\u6027\uff1b(2) \u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u5e73\u7a33\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\uff08LSWT\uff09\u63d0\u53d6\u7a33\u5b9a\u9891\u57df\u8868\u793a\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u6b8b\u5dee\uff1b(3) \u901a\u9053\u6df7\u5408\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5efa\u6a21\u8de8\u901a\u9053\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b(4) \u4e24\u7ea7\u975e\u91cd\u53e0\u5206\u5757\u673a\u5236\u6355\u83b7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6b8b\u5dee\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cHPMixer\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HPMixer\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u5468\u671f\u6027\u4e0e\u6b8b\u5dee\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u671f\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Includes appendix with detailed experimental results and prompts", "summary": "Evaluating the social intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly requires moving beyond static text generation toward dynamic, adversarial interaction. We introduce the Adversarial Resource Extraction Game (AREG), a benchmark that operationalizes persuasion and resistance as a multi-turn, zero-sum negotiation over financial resources. Using a round-robin tournament across frontier models, AREG enables joint evaluation of offensive (persuasion) and defensive (resistance) capabilities within a single interactional framework. Our analysis provides evidence that these capabilities are weakly correlated ($\u03c1= 0.33$) and empirically dissociated: strong persuasive performance does not reliably predict strong resistance, and vice versa. Across all evaluated models, resistance scores exceed persuasion scores, indicating a systematic defensive advantage in adversarial dialogue settings. Further linguistic analysis suggests that interaction structure plays a central role in these outcomes. Incremental commitment-seeking strategies are associated with higher extraction success, while verification-seeking responses are more prevalent in successful defenses than explicit refusal. Together, these findings indicate that social influence in LLMs is not a monolithic capability and that evaluation frameworks focusing on persuasion alone may overlook asymmetric behavioral vulnerabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAREG\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8d44\u6e90\u63d0\u53d6\u6e38\u620f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u4e0e\u6297\u8fa9\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u8005\u5f31\u76f8\u5173\u4e14\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u9632\u5fa1\u8868\u73b0\u666e\u904d\u4f18\u4e8e\u8bf4\u670d\uff0c\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ed3\u6784\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u8861\u91cf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u6297\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u8bf4\u670d\u4e0e\u62b5\u6297\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u8f6e\u96f6\u548c\u8c08\u5224\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8d44\u6e90\u63d0\u53d6\u6e38\u620f\uff08AREG\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5faa\u73af\u8d5b\u5236\u5bf9\u524d\u6cbf\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u8bf4\u670d\u4e0e\u9632\u5fa1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u63a2\u7a76\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u8bf4\u670d\u4e0e\u62b5\u6297\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\u76f8\u5173\uff08\u03c1=0.33\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u6027\uff1b\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u62b5\u6297\u5f97\u5206\u5747\u9ad8\u4e8e\u8bf4\u670d\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u9632\u5fa1\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b\u589e\u91cf\u5f0f\u627f\u8bfa\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u800c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5bfb\u6c42\u578b\u56de\u5e94\u66f4\u5e38\u89c1\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u5e76\u975e\u5355\u4e00\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f1a\u5ffd\u89c6\u5176\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5e94\u6784\u5efa\u517c\u987e\u653b\u9632\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, this interpretability comes at a prohibitive cost: the standard formulation necessitates a full-dataset scan at every timestep, scaling linearly with dataset size. In this work, we present the first systematic study addressing this scalability bottleneck. We challenge the prevailing assumption that the entire training data is necessary, uncovering the phenomenon of Posterior Progressive Concentration: the effective golden support of the denoising score is not static but shrinks asymptotically from the global manifold to a local neighborhood as the signal-to-noise ratio increases. Capitalizing on this, we propose Dynamic Time-Aware Golden Subset Diffusion (GoldDiff), a training-free framework that decouples inference complexity from dataset size. Instead of static retrieval, GoldDiff uses a coarse-to-fine mechanism to dynamically pinpoint the ''Golden Subset'' for inference. Theoretically, we derive rigorous bounds guaranteeing that our sparse approximation converges to the exact score. Empirically, GoldDiff achieves a $\\bf 71 \\times$ speedup on AFHQ while matching or achieving even better performance than full-scan baselines. Most notably, we demonstrate the first successful scaling of analytical diffusion to ImageNet-1K, unlocking a scalable, training-free paradigm for large-scale generative modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGoldDiff\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u6790\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u56e0\u9700\u5168\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u626b\u63cf\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63ed\u793a\u540e\u9a8c\u6e10\u8fdb\u96c6\u4e2d\u73b0\u8c61\uff08Posterior Progressive Concentration\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u968f\u7740\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u53bb\u566a\u5f97\u5206\u7684\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u533a\u57df\u4ece\u5168\u5c40\u6d41\u5f62\u9010\u6e10\u6536\u7f29\u81f3\u5c40\u90e8\u90bb\u57df\uff0cGoldDiff\u91c7\u7528\u7c97\u5230\u7cbe\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63a8\u7406\u6240\u9700\u7684\u201c\u9ec4\u91d1\u5b50\u96c6\u201d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u7a00\u758f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u80fd\u6536\u655b\u5230\u7cbe\u786e\u5f97\u5206\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGoldDiff\u5728AFHQ\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8671\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u900a\u4e8e\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8e\u5168\u626b\u63cf\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u5206\u6790\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u81f3ImageNet-1K\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u6790\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5177\u6570\u5b66\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u90fd\u9700\u5168\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u968f\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u5176\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7a81\u7834\u8fd9\u4e00\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u6240\u9700\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9ec4\u91d1\u5b50\u96c6\u6269\u6563\uff08GoldDiff\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u540e\u9a8c\u6e10\u8fdb\u96c6\u4e2d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7c97\u5230\u7cbe\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u9009\u62e9\u5c40\u90e8\u90bb\u57df\u5185\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6837\u672c\u6784\u6210\u2018\u9ec4\u91d1\u5b50\u96c6\u2019\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u3001\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "GoldDiff\u5728AFHQ\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b071\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5168\u626b\u63cf\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u9996\u6b21\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u5206\u6790\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eImageNet-1K\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u540e\u9a8c\u652f\u6301\u533a\u57df\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51faGoldDiff\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This paper introduces Quecto-V1, a domain-specific Small Language Model (SLM) engineered to democratize access to Indian legal intelligence. Built upon a custom configuration of the GPT-2 architecture (124 million parameters), Quecto-V1 was trained from scratch exclusively on a corpus of Indian statutes, including the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), and the Constitution of India. Unlike generalist models, which prioritize broad world knowledge, our approach maximizes \"lexical density\" within the legal domain. Furthermore, we address the deployment bottleneck by applying post-training 8-bit quantization (GGUF format), compressing the model to a memory footprint of under 150 MB. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that Quecto-V1 achieves high fidelity in retrieving statutory definitions and penal provisions, outperforming general-purpose SLMs in domain-specific exact match tasks while running entirely offline on consumer-grade CPUs. We further present an ablation study showing that 8-bit quantization yields a 74% reduction in model size with less than 3.5% degradation in retrieval accuracy compared to full-precision baselines. These findings suggest that for specialized, high-stakes domains like law, domain-specific training coupled with aggressive quantization offers a viable, privacy-preserving alternative to monolithic cloud models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa Quecto-V1\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e GPT-2 \u67b6\u6784\uff081.24 \u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u5370\u5ea6\u6cd5\u5f8b\u667a\u80fd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6587\u672c\uff08\u5982\u5211\u6cd5\u5178\u3001\u5211\u4e8b\u8bc9\u8bbc\u6cd5\u5178\u548c\u5baa\u6cd5\uff09\u4e0a\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7 8 \u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\uff08GGUF \u683c\u5f0f\uff09\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u81f3 150 MB \u4ee5\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7 CPU \u4e0a\u79bb\u7ebf\u8fd0\u884c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6761\u6587\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u91cf\u5316\u4ec5\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f4e\u4e8e 3.5% \u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\uff08\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u51cf\u5c11 74%\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982 7B+ \u53c2\u6570\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e91\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5bf9\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0d\u53cb\u597d\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4e3b\u6743\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u79c1\u5bc6\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5370\u5ea6\u6cd5\u5f8b\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\u4e0e\u672c\u5730\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5b9a\u5236\u5316 GPT-2 \u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e8e\u5370\u5ea6\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528 8 \u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff08GGUF \u683c\u5f0f\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\uff1b\u5728\u6cd5\u5b9a\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0e\u5904\u7f5a\u6761\u6b3e\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u5c55\u91cf\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "Quecto-V1 \u5728\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff1b8 \u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u4f53\u79ef\u51cf\u5c11 74%\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u5c0f\u4e8e 3.5%\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7 CPU \u4e0a\u79bb\u7ebf\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u9690\u79c1\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u6fc0\u8fdb\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u662f\u66ff\u4ee3\u5927\u578b\u4e91\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u6280\u672f\u666e\u60e0\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u81ea\u4e3b\u3002"}}

We propose \\emph{Conditionally Additive Local Models} (CALMs), a new model class, that balances the interpretability of GAMs with the accuracy of GA$^2$Ms. CALMs allow multiple univariate shape functions per feature, each active in different regions of the input space. These regions are defined independently for each feature as simple logical conditions (thresholds) on the features it interacts with. As a result, effects remain locally additive while varying across subregions to capture interactions. We further propose a principled distillation-based training pipeline that identifies homogeneous regions with limited interactions and fits interpretable shape functions via region-aware backfitting.

However, recent efforts to extend alignment to other languages often require substantial resources, either through large-scale, high-quality supervision in the target language or through pairwise alignment with high-resource languages, which limits scalability. In this work, we propose a resource-efficient method for improving multilingual safety alignment. We introduce a plug-and-play Multi-Lingual Consistency (MLC) loss that can be integrated into existing monolingual alignment pipelines. By improving collinearity between multilingual representation vectors, our method encourages directional consistency at the multilingual semantic level in a single update. This allows simultaneous alignment across multiple languages using only multilingual prompt variants without requiring additional response-level supervision in low-resource languages. We validate the proposed method across different model architectures and alignment paradigms, and demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing multilingual safety with limited impact on general model utility. Further evaluation across languages and tasks indicates improved cross-lingual generalization, suggesting the proposed approach as a practical solution for multilingual consistency alignment under limited supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08MLC\uff09\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5355\u8bed\u5bf9\u9f50\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u5411\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5171\u7ebf\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e00\u6b21\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u53d8\u4f53\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u989d\u5916\u54cd\u5e94\u7ea7\u76d1\u7763\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u76d1\u7763\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5c06\u5bf9\u9f50\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5982\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6216\u4e0e\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u8fdb\u884c\u6210\u5bf9\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08MLC\uff09\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u5411\u91cf\u95f4\u7684\u5171\u7ebf\u6027\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u4e49\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u8be5\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u5d4c\u5165\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u8bed\u5bf9\u9f50\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u54cd\u5e94\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u53d8\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u540c\u6b65\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\u5747\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\uff0c\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MLC\u635f\u5931\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

In recent years, this problem is increasingly tackled using deep learning methods. A common strategy involves predicting a molecular fingerprint vector from an input mass spectrum, which is then used to search for matches in a chemical compound database. While various loss functions are employed in training these predictive models, their impact on model performance remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigate commonly used loss functions, deriving novel regret bounds that characterize when Bayes-optimal decisions for these objectives must diverge. Our results reveal a fundamental trade-off between the two objectives of (1) fingerprint similarity and (2) molecular retrieval. Optimizing for more accurate fingerprint predictions typically worsens retrieval results, and vice versa. Our theoretical analysis shows this trade-off depends on the similarity structure of candidate sets, providing guidance for loss function and fingerprint selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6db2\u76f8\u8272\u8c31-\u4e32\u8054\u8d28\u8c31\uff08LC-MS/MS\uff09\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7528\u4e8e\u5316\u5408\u7269\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5e38\u7528\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5206\u5b50\u6307\u7eb9\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5206\u5b50\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u679c\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u4f18\u5316\u6307\u7eb9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53cd\u4e4b\u4ea6\u7136\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u6743\u8861\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5019\u9009\u5316\u5408\u7269\u96c6\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u6307\u7eb9\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728LC-MS/MS\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u8d28\u8c31\u56fe\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5b50\u6307\u7eb9\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u5316\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5176\u5bf9\u6307\u7eb9\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5206\u5b50\u68c0\u7d22\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u673a\u5236\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u5bfc\u65b0\u7684\u540e\u6094\u8fb9\u754c\uff08regret bounds\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5e38\u89c1\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6700\u4f18\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u6307\u7eb9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0e\u5206\u5b50\u68c0\u7d22\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5019\u9009\u96c6\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6307\u7eb9\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5206\u5b50\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u679c\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u8c03\u548c\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u4f18\u5316\u4e00\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u5f80\u5f80\u524a\u5f31\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\uff1b\u8be5\u6743\u8861\u7531\u5019\u9009\u5316\u5408\u7269\u96c6\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1LC-MS/MS\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u6743\u8861\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u5b9e\u9645\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e94\u7ed3\u5408\u5019\u9009\u96c6\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u6307\u7eb9\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

We compare two training regimes: a one-stage agent that jointly selects the gate type, the affected qubit(s), and the rotation angle; and a two-stage variant that first proposes a discrete circuit and subsequently optimizes the rotation angles with Adam using parameter-shift gradients. Using Gymnasium and PennyLane, we evaluate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Advantage Actor--Critic (A2C) on systems comprising two to ten qubits and on targets of increasing complexity with \\(\u03bb\\) ranging from one to five. Whereas A2C does not learn effective policies in this setting, PPO succeeds under stable hyperparameters (one-stage: learning rate approximately \\(5\\times10^{-4}\\) with a self-fidelity-error threshold of 0.01; two-stage: learning rate approximately \\(10^{-4}\\)). Both approaches reliably reconstruct computational basis states (between 83\\% and 99\\% success) and Bell states (between 61\\% and 77\\% success). However, scalability saturates for \\(\u03bb\\) of approximately three to four and does not extend to ten-qubit targets even at \\(\u03bb=2\\). The two-stage method offers only marginal accuracy gains while requiring around three times the runtime. For practicality under a fixed compute budget, we therefore recommend the one-stage PPO policy, provide explicit synthesized circuits, and contrast with a classical variational baseline to outline avenues for improved scalability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u6709\u5411\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u5408\u6210\uff08DQCS\uff09\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u5305\u542b\u8fde\u7eed\u5355\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u65cb\u8f6c\uff08Rx, Ry, Rz\uff09\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5236\u5907\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7PPO\u548cA2C\u7b97\u6cd5\u57282\u523010\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u8054\u5408\u9009\u62e9\u95e8\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u4f5c\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u89d2\u5ea6\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5148\u751f\u6210\u79bb\u6563\u7535\u8def\u518d\u4f18\u5316\u89d2\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e24\u8005\u5747\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u91cd\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\u6001\uff0883%-99%\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff09\u548c\u8d1d\u5c14\u6001\uff0861%-77%\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u76ee\u6807\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff08\u03bb\u22483-4\uff09\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u9971\u548c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u81f310\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u3002\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7565\u6709\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u8017\u65f6\u7ea6\u4e3a\u4e09\u500d\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u63a8\u8350\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5PPO\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u4f53\u5408\u6210\u7535\u8def\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u53d8\u5206\u57fa\u7ebf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u9650\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u95e8\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u8fde\u7eed\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5236\u5907\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Gymnasium\u4e0ePennyLane\u6784\u5efa\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) \u548c Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) \u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u8054\u5408\u51b3\u7b56\u95e8\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u4e0e\u65cb\u8f6c\u89d2\uff09\u4e0e\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u5148\u751f\u6210\u79bb\u6563\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u518d\u7528Adam\u7ed3\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u79fb\u4f4d\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u89d2\u5ea6\uff09\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8986\u76d62\u201310\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ca\u03bb=1\u20135\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "PPO\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u8d85\u53c2\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u5b66\u4e60\u7387~5\u00d710\u207b\u2074\uff0c\u81ea\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u8bef\u5dee\u9608\u503c0.01\uff09\u3001\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u5b66\u4e60\u7387~10\u207b\u2074\uff09\u5747\u6210\u529f\u91cd\u5efa\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\u6001\uff0883%-99%\uff09\u548c\u8d1d\u5c14\u6001\uff0861%-77%\uff09\u3002\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u03bb\u22483-4\u65f6\u9971\u548c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u62d3\u5c55\u81f310\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u3002\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5e26\u6765\u5fae\u5f31\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u4e3a\u4e09\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5PPO\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u5177\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff1b\u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u7528\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u53d8\u5206\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6307\u660e\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, their potential is limited by the next-token prediction (NTP) training paradigm. NTP optimizes single-token predictions and ignores semantic coherence across multiple tokens following a prefix. Consequently, fast weight models, which dynamically update their parameters to store contextual information, learn suboptimal representations that fail to capture long-range dependencies. We introduce REFINE (Reinforced Fast weIghts with Next sEquence prediction), a reinforcement learning framework that trains fast weight models under the next-sequence prediction (NSP) objective. REFINE selects informative token positions based on prediction entropy, generates multi-token rollouts, assigns self-supervised sequence-level rewards, and optimizes the model with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). REFINE is applicable throughout the training lifecycle of pre-trained language models: mid-training, post-training, and test-time training. Our experiments on LaCT-760M and DeltaNet-1.3B demonstrate that REFINE consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning with NTP across needle-in-a-haystack retrieval, long-context question answering, and diverse tasks in LongBench.

It aims to maintain electricity grid capacity limits and prevent congestion by financially incentivising end users to reduce or shift their energy consumption. The proposed framework adopts a hierarchical architecture in which a service provider adjusts hourly incentive rates based on wholesale electricity prices and aggregated residential load. The financial interests of both the service provider and end users are explicitly considered. A deep reinforcement learning approach is employed to learn optimal real-time incentive rates under explicit capacity constraints. Heterogeneous user preferences are modelled through appliance-level home energy management systems and dissatisfaction costs. Using real-world residential electricity consumption and price data from three households, simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively reduces peak demand and smooths the aggregated load profile. This leads to an approximately 22.82% reduction in the peak-to-average ratio compared to the no-demand-response case.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5bb9\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\u578b\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4f\u5b85\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6fc0\u52b1\u4fc3\u4f7f\u7528\u6237\u51cf\u5c11\u6216\u8f6c\u79fb\u7528\u7535\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u7535\u7f51\u8fc7\u8f7d\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u6839\u636e\u6279\u53d1\u7535\u4ef7\u548c\u805a\u5408\u8d1f\u8377\u8c03\u6574\u6bcf\u5c0f\u65f6\u6fc0\u52b1\u8d39\u7387\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u7684\u5229\u76ca\u3002\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u65f6\u6fc0\u52b1\u8d39\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u7528\u6237\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u504f\u597d\u53ca\u4e0d\u6ee1\u6210\u672c\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u4e2a\u5bb6\u5ead\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u7535\u4e0e\u7535\u4ef7\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u5cf0\u503c\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e73\u6ed1\u8d1f\u8377\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u4f7f\u5cf0\u5747\u6bd4\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\u60c5\u51b5\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea622.82%\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9\u4f4f\u5b85\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\u4e2d\u7684\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u4e0e\u8d1f\u8377\u62e5\u5835\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6fc0\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u7528\u6237\u4e3b\u52a8\u8c03\u8282\u7528\u7535\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u517c\u987e\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u7684\u5229\u76ca\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u5b9e\u65f6\u6fc0\u52b1\u8d39\u7387\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5bb6\u7535\u7ea7\u5bb6\u5ead\u80fd\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u504f\u597d\u4e0e\u4e0d\u6ee1\u610f\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bb9\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5cf0\u503c\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e73\u6ed1\u8d1f\u8377\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u4f7f\u5cf0\u5747\u6bd4\u4e0b\u964d\u7ea622.82%\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u7535\u7f51\u538b\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\u578b\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ef4\u6301\u7535\u7f51\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u7528\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5229\u76ca\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

While parameter sharing in VQCs can reduce the parameter space dimensionality and potentially mitigate the barren plateau phenomenon, it introduces a complex trade-off that has been largely overlooked. This paper investigates how parameter sharing, despite creating better global optima with fewer parameters, fundamentally alters the optimization landscape through deceptive gradients -- regions where gradient information exists but systematically misleads optimizers away from global optima. Through systematic experimental analysis, we demonstrate that increasing degrees of parameter sharing generate more complex solution landscapes with heightened gradient magnitudes and measurably higher deceptiveness ratios. Our findings reveal that traditional gradient-based optimizers (Adam, SGD) show progressively degraded convergence as parameter sharing increases, with performance heavily dependent on hyperparameter selection. We introduce a novel gradient deceptiveness detection algorithm and a quantitative framework for measuring optimization difficulty in quantum circuits, establishing that while parameter sharing can improve circuit expressivity by orders of magnitude, this comes at the cost of significantly increased landscape deceptiveness. These insights provide important considerations for quantum circuit design in practical applications, highlighting the fundamental mismatch between classical optimization strategies and quantum parameter landscapes shaped by parameter sharing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\uff08VQC\uff09\u4e2d\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c3d\u7ba1\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u6536\u655b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8d8a\u9ad8\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u8d8a\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u8d8a\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff08\u5982Adam\u3001SGD\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6b3a\u9a97\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u7535\u8def\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5374\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u52a0\u4f18\u5316\u96be\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u5728\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u4e2d\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u5b9e\u9645\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u666f\u89c2\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u68af\u5ea6\u6b3a\u9a97\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4f18\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u666f\u89c2\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u5e45\u5ea6\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u6bd4\u7387\u5347\u9ad8\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u5171\u4eab\u7a0b\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u6076\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\uff1b\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u867d\u589e\u5f3a\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f18\u5316\u96be\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u867d\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u9ad8\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u666f\u89c2\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7ecf\u5178\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This paper introduces AIFL (Artificial Intelligence for Floods), a deterministic LSTM-based model designed for global daily streamflow forecasting. Trained on 18,588 basins curated from the CARAVAN dataset, AIFL utilises a novel two-stage training strategy to bridge the reanalysis-to-forecast domain shift. The model is first pre-trained on 40 years of ERA5-Land reanalysis (1980-2019) to capture robust hydrological processes, then fine-tuned on operational Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) control forecasts (2016-2019) to adapt to the specific error structures and biases of operational numerical weather prediction. To our knowledge, this is the first global model trained end-to-end within the CARAVAN ecosystem. On an independent temporal test set (2021-2024), AIFL achieves high predictive skill with a median modified Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE') of 0.66 and a median Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.53. Benchmarking results show that AIFL is highly competitive with current state-of-the-art global systems, achieving comparable accuracy while maintaining a transparent and reproducible forcing pipeline. The model demonstrates exceptional reliability in extreme-event detection, providing a streamlined and operationally robust baseline for the global hydrological community.", "AI": {"tldr": "AIFL \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e LSTM \u7684\u5168\u7403\u65e5\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5f84\u6d41\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5148\u5728 ERA5-Land \u91cd\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u518d\u5728 IFS \u64cd\u4f5c\u9884\u62a5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u5386\u53f2\u91cd\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u9884\u62a5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728 18,588 \u4e2a\u6d41\u57df\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u65f6\u95f4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\uff082021\u20132024\uff09\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e2d\u4f4d KGE' 0.66 \u548c NSE 0.53\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5168\u7403\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5f84\u6d41\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ece\u5386\u53f2\u91cd\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230\u5b9e\u9645\u64cd\u4f5c\u9884\u62a5\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u64cd\u4f5c\u9884\u62a5\u504f\u5dee\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5168\u7403\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u5728 40 \u5e74\u7684 ERA5-Land \u91cd\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\uff081980\u20132019\uff09\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6c34\u6587\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u5728 2016\u20132019 \u5e74\u7684 IFS \u63a7\u5236\u9884\u62a5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u64cd\u4f5c\u9884\u62a5\u4e2d\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u6574\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5728 CARAVAN \u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u65f6\u95f4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\uff082021\u20132024\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cAIFL \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u4f4d KGE' 0.66\u3001NSE 0.53\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5168\u7403\u6c34\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u5c24\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "AIFL \u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5728 CARAVAN \u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5168\u7403\u65e5\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5f84\u6d41\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u91cd\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u64cd\u4f5c\u9884\u62a5\u95f4\u7684\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5168\u7403\u6c34\u6587\u793e\u533a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Such algorithms have been proposed for tasks ranging from inverse problems and guided image generation to reasoning. However, the methods currently deployed in practice are heuristics with a variety of failure modes -- and we have very little understanding of when these heuristics can be efficiently improved.\n  In this paper, we consider the task of sampling from a reward-tilted diffusion model -- that is, sampling from $p^{\\star}(x) \\propto p(x) \\exp(r(x))$ -- given a reward function $r$ and pre-trained diffusion oracle for $p$. We provide a fine-grained analysis of the computational tractability of this task for quadratic rewards $r(x) = x^\\top A x + b^\\top x$. We show that linear-reward tilts are always efficiently sampleable -- a simple result that seems to have gone unnoticed in the literature. We use this as a building block, along with a conceptually new ingredient -- the Hubbard-Stratonovich transform -- to provide an efficient algorithm for sampling from low-rank positive-definite quadratic tilts, i.e. $r(x) = x^\\top A x$ where $A$ is positive-definite and of rank $O(1)$. For negative-definite tilts, i.e. $r(x) = - x^\\top A x$ where $A$ is positive-definite, we prove that the problem is intractable even if $A$ is of rank 1 (albeit with exponentially-large entries).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5956\u52b1\u503e\u659c\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e8c\u6b21\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u603b\u662f\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u6837\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u970d\u4f2f-\u65af\u7279\u62c9\u6258\u8bfa\u7ef4\u5947\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u4f4e\u79e9\u6b63\u5b9a\u4e8c\u6b21\u503e\u659c\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u800c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8d1f\u5b9a\u503e\u659c\uff08\u5373\u4f7f\u79e9\u4e3a1\uff09\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7b97\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u4f55\u65f6\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5398\u6e05\u5956\u52b1\u503e\u659c\u91c7\u6837\u4efb\u52a1\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u970d\u4f2f-\u65af\u7279\u62c9\u6258\u8bfa\u7ef4\u5947\u53d8\u6362\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ebf\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4f4e\u79e9\u6b63\u5b9a\u4e8c\u6b21\u503e\u659c\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u8d1f\u5b9a\u503e\u659c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u56f0\u96be\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7ebf\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u503e\u659c\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u6837\uff1b\u4f4e\u79e9\u6b63\u5b9a\u4e8c\u6b21\u503e\u659c\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u8d1f\u5b9a\u4e8c\u6b21\u503e\u659c\u5373\u4f7f\u79e9\u4e3a1\u4e5f\u5c5e\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5956\u52b1\u503e\u659c\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

By leveraging data fusion and analytics techniques, traffic demand forecasting serves as a key intermediate measure for identifying emerging spatial and temporal demand patterns. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by proposing two gradient boosting model variations, one for classiffication and one for regression, both capable of generating demand forecasts at various temporal horizons, from 5 minutes up to one hour. Our overall approach effectively integrates temporal and contextual features, enabling accurate predictions that are essential for improving the efficiency of shared (micro-) mobility services. To evaluate its effectiveness, we utilize open shared mobility data derived from e-scooter and e-bike networks in five metropolitan areas. These real-world datasets allow us to compare our approach with state-of-the-art methods as well as a Generative AI-based model, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing the complexities of modern urban mobility.

Such models often require discretization of continuous neural time series data, a process referred to as 'tokenization'. However, the impact of different tokenization strategies for neural data is currently poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of sample-level tokenization strategies for transformer-based large neuroimaging models (LNMs) applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We compare learnable and non-learnable tokenizers by examining their signal reconstruction fidelity and their impact on subsequent foundation modeling performance (token prediction, biological plausibility of generated data, preservation of subject-specific information, and performance on downstream tasks). For the learnable tokenizer, we introduce a novel approach based on an autoencoder. Experiments were conducted on three publicly available MEG datasets spanning different acquisition sites, scanners, and experimental paradigms. Our results show that both learnable and non-learnable discretization schemes achieve high reconstruction accuracy and broadly comparable performance across most evaluation criteria, suggesting that simple fixed sample-level tokenization strategies can be used in the development of neural foundation models.

Differential temporal difference (TD) learning algorithms are a major advance for average reward RL as they provide an efficient online method to learn the value functions associated with the average reward in both on-policy and off-policy settings. However, existing convergence guarantees require a local clock in learning rates tied to state visit counts, which practitioners do not use and does not extend beyond tabular settings. We address this limitation by proving the almost sure convergence of on-policy $n$-step differential TD for any $n$ using standard diminishing learning rates without a local clock. We then derive three sufficient conditions under which off-policy $n$-step differential TD also converges without a local clock. These results strengthen the theoretical foundations of differential TD and bring its convergence analysis closer to practical implementations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u949f\u7684n\u6b65\u5dee\u5206TD\u7b97\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u72b6\u6001\u8bbf\u95ee\u8ba1\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u975e\u7b56\u7565\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5dee\u5206TD\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e0e\u72b6\u6001\u8bbf\u95ee\u6b21\u6570\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u949f\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u975e\u8868\u683c\u5316\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u9012\u51cf\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u7b56\u7565\u5185n\u6b65\u5dee\u5206TD\u51e0\u4e4e\u5fc5\u7136\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u975e\u7b56\u7565\u4e0bn\u6b65\u5dee\u5206TD\u65e0\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u949f\u4e5f\u80fd\u6536\u655b\u7684\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u5185\u548c\u975e\u7b56\u7565\u4e0bn\u6b65\u5dee\u5206TD\u5728\u65e0\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u949f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u51e0\u4e4e\u5fc5\u7136\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5dee\u5206TD\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u5e76\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5206TD\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Despite its prevalence, the theoretical understanding of NC remains limited. Existing analyses largely ignore the role of the optimizer, thereby suggesting that NC is universal across optimization methods. In this work, we challenge this assumption and demonstrate that the choice of optimizer plays a critical role in the emergence of NC. The phenomenon is typically quantified through NC metrics, which, however, are difficult to track and analyze theoretically. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel diagnostic metric, NC0, whose convergence to zero is a necessary condition for NC. Using NC0, we provide theoretical evidence that NC cannot emerge under decoupled weight decay in adaptive optimizers, as implemented in AdamW. Concretely, we prove that SGD, SignGD with coupled weight decay (a special case of Adam), and SignGD with decoupled weight decay (a special case of AdamW) exhibit qualitatively different NC0 dynamics. Also, we show the accelerating effect of momentum on NC (beyond convergence of train loss) when trained with SGD, being the first result concerning momentum in the context of NC. Finally, we conduct extensive empirical experiments consisting of 3,900 training runs across various datasets, architectures, optimizers, and hyperparameters, confirming our theoretical results.

While various heuristic and machine learning-based approaches have been proposed, many require a large number of sequence evaluations, which limits their applicability when experimental validation is costly. We propose a method to solve the problem using a factorization machine with quadratic-optimization annealing (FMQA). FMQA is a discrete black-box optimization method reported to obtain high-quality solutions with a limited number of evaluations. Applying FMQA to the problem requires converting nucleotides into binary variables. However, the influence of integer-to-nucleotide assignments and binary-integer encoding on the performance of FMQA has not been thoroughly investigated, even though such choices determine the structure of the surrogate model and the search landscape, and thus can directly affect solution quality. Therefore, this study aims both to establish a novel FMQA framework for RNA inverse folding and to analyze the effects of these assignments and encoding methods. We evaluated all 24 possible assignments of the four nucleotides to the ordered integers (0-3), in combination with four binary-integer encoding methods. Our results demonstrated that one-hot and domain-wall encodings outperform binary and unary encodings in terms of the normalized ensemble defect value. In domain-wall encoding, nucleotides assigned to the boundary integers (0 and 3) appeared with higher frequency. In the RNA inverse folding problem, assigning guanine and cytosine to these boundary integers promoted their enrichment in stem regions, which led to more thermodynamically stable secondary structures than those obtained with one-hot encoding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFMQA\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8eRNA\u9006\u6298\u53e0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u6838\u82f7\u9178\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fb9\u754c\u6574\u6570\u5206\u914d\u7ed3\u5408\u57df\u5899\u7f16\u7801\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u7ed3\u6784\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u5e8f\u5217\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff1b\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u89e3\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u56e0\u5b50\u673a\u4e0e\u4e8c\u6b21\u4f18\u5316\u9000\u706b\uff08FMQA\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6838\u82f7\u9178\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4e8c\u5143\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd524\u79cd\u6838\u82f7\u9178\u5230\u6574\u6570\uff080-3\uff09\u7684\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u5f0f\u53ca\u56db\u79cd\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236-\u6574\u6570\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u57df\u5899\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u5c06\u9e1f\u560c\u5464\u548c\u80de\u5627\u5576\u5206\u914d\u81f3\u8fb9\u754c\u6574\u6570\uff080\u548c3\uff09\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u830e\u533a\u5bcc\u96c6\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4e8c\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6700\u4f18\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5728RNA\u9006\u6298\u53e0\u4e2d\u4f18\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u57df\u5899\u7f16\u7801\u5e76\u5408\u7406\u5206\u914d\u6838\u82f7\u9178\u81f3\u8fb9\u754c\u6574\u6570\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7ed3\u6784\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

We demonstrate that this approach, and security definitions that enable it, carry significant privacy risks for the remaining (undeleted) data points. We present a reconstruction attack showing that for certain tasks, which can be computed securely without deletions, a mechanism adhering to perfect retraining allows an adversary controlling merely $\u03c9(1)$ data points to reconstruct almost the entire dataset merely by issuing deletion requests.

Our position is that causal inference specifies what constitutes a valid mapping from model activations to invariant high-level structures, the data or assumptions needed to achieve it, and the inferences it can support. Specifically, Pearl's causal hierarchy clarifies what an interpretability study can justify. Observations establish associations between model behaviour and internal components. Interventions (e.g., ablations or activation patching) support claims how these edits affect a behavioural metric (\\eg, average change in token probabilities) over a set of prompts. However, counterfactual claims -- i.e., asking what the model output would have been for the same prompt under an unobserved intervention -- remain largely unverifiable without controlled supervision. We show how causal representation learning (CRL) operationalises this hierarchy, specifying which variables are recoverable from activations and under what assumptions. Together, these motivate a diagnostic framework that helps practitioners select methods and evaluations matching claims to evidence such that findings generalise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u7ed3\u8bba\u4e0d\u5177\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8d85\u8d8a\u8bc1\u636e\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8ePearl\u56e0\u679c\u5c42\u6b21\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u533a\u5206\u89c2\u5bdf\u3001\u5e72\u9884\u4e0e\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CRL\uff09\u6765\u754c\u5b9a\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e2d\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u53ca\u5176\u5047\u8bbe\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u6839\u636e\u8bc1\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7ed3\u8bba\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u8bba\u4e0d\u901a\u7528\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u8d85\u51fa\u73b0\u6709\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6301\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8ePearl\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5c42\u6b21\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CRL\uff09\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5224\u65ad\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6240\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6307\u5bfc\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u6839\u636e\u8bc1\u636e\u5f3a\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u539f\u5219\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u907f\u514d\u4e0d\u5f53\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u8bba\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

However, estimation becomes challenging in the imbalanced regime, where one matrix dimension is much larger than the other. In EHR applications, cohort sizes are often limited by disease prevalence or data availability, whereas the feature space remains extremely large due to the breadth of medical coding system. Motivated by the increasing availability of external semantic embeddings, such as pre-trained embeddings of clinical concepts in EHRs, we propose a knowledge-embedded latent projection model that leverages semantic side information to regularize representation learning. Specifically, we model column embeddings as smooth functions of semantic embeddings via a mapping in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We develop a computationally efficient two-step estimation procedure that combines semantically guided subspace construction via kernel principal component analysis with scalable projected gradient descent. We establish estimation error bounds that characterize the trade-off between statistical error and approximation error induced by the kernel projection. Furthermore, we provide local convergence guarantees for our non-convex optimization procedure.
